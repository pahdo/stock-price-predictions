  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
   
  Note 1. Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial information has been prepared by DigitalTown, Inc. (the  Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. ) ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, it does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of this financial information have been included.  Financial results for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year as a whole or any other interim period.  This financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016. 
   
  Note 2. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies : 
   
    Nature of Business    
   
 The Company was founded in 1982 under the laws of the State of Minnesota as Command Small Computer Learning Center, Inc., a computer training company and operated under several different names in the computer hardware and training sector. In 2005, the Company began acquiring domain names. On March 1, 2007, the Company changed its name to DigitalTown, Inc. and began developing a business plan to develop a platform to monetize their domain names. The Company's headquarters are located at 10655 NE 4 th  Street, Suite 801, Bellevue, WA 98004, and its telephone and facsimile numbers are (425) 295-4564 and (425) 651-2889, respectively. The Company's Internet address is www.digitaltown.com. The Company's common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market under the ticker DGTW. 
   
 The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a working capital deficit, recurring losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  
   
 At August 31, 2016 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $33,084,039.  The Company anticipates that expected future proceeds from additional financing through the sale of its common stock or other equity-based securities, and additional sales and/or leases of existing domain names will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs through at least August 31, 2017.  In the event that the Company is unable to obtain additional capital in the future, the Company would be forced to further reduce operating expenses and/or cease operations altogether. 
   
    Principles of Consolidation    
   
 The Company files consolidated financial statements that include its wholly-owned subsidiaries Tiger Media and The School Network, Inc. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
    Reclassifications     
   
 Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Proceeds from related party notes payable received in the prior period have been reclassified from the prior period classification.  

7 

Use of Estimates    
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
    Accounts Receivable    
   
 Accounts receivable arose from the sale of and commission earned from display advertising and development services. The Company evaluates collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including the age of the receivable or a specific customer's inability to meet its financial conditions. In these circumstances, the Company records an allowance to reduce the receivable to an amount it deems collectible. The Company has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts is not necessary as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016. 
   
    Revenue Recognition    
   
 The Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria have been met: 

Persuasive evidence that an agreement exists 

Delivery has occurred 

The price is fixed and determinable 

Collectability is reasonably assured 

The Company primarily recognizes revenue from sale of software licenses and related development services.  Software licensing and development revenue is recognized as invoiced. In the event of projects with multiple project milestones, revenue is recognized as milestones are achieved and invoices are submitted for payment. 
   
 The Company may also be merchant of record for merchant transactions processed on the DigitalTown platform.  In this case, revenue is recognized on the date of the transaction.  The Company has experience in merchant transaction fraud mitigation.  To the extent that chargebacks become material, the Company will implement a formal practice for allowance for doubtful accounts. 
   
 The Company also recognizes revenue from the sale of display advertising appearing on specific pages of individual sites within DigitalTown's network.  Display advertising is sold by the Company directly to local merchants and placed by the Company on specific pages of individual sites targeted by the local merchant.  The terms of these sales are for a fixed monthly amount for a period ranging from three months to one year.   
   
 The Company has also entered into certain third party agreements which allow display advertising to be placed on individual sites within DigitalTown's network.  Per these agreements, the Company receives commissions based on a percentage of the per click or per-impression revenue generated by these ads.  The Company recognizes these commissions received as revenue. 
   
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
   
 Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S.  

8 

GAAP ), certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value. 
   
 As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the Company does not have any financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard. The Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows: 
   
 Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
   
 Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 
   
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
   
 There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for the six months ended August 31, 2016 or the year ended February 29, 2016. 
   
    Cash and Cash Equivalents    
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the Company had no cash equivalents. 
   
    Cash Deposits in Excess of Federally Insured Limits    
   
 The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company and currently have insurance coverage up to $250,000.  
   
    Prepaid Domain Names     
   
 The annual domain name renewal fees are currently amortized over one year and the purchase of any new domain names are the only amounts being capitalized. See Note 5 for further information. 
   
    Property and Equipment     
   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the related lease. The Company recorded $1,770 and $1,818 of depreciation expense for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred; major renewals and improvements are capitalized. As items of property or equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operating income. See Note 4 for further information. 
   
    Income Taxes    
   
 Deferred tax assets (net of any valuation allowance) and liabilities resulting from temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are recorded using an asset-and-liability method.  Deferred taxes relating to temporary differences and loss carryforwards are measured using the tax rate expected to be in effect when they are reversed or are realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be ultimately realized. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the related future benefits. 

9 

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB guidance.  This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The Company's adoption on March 1, 2009 of the provisions specifically related to uncertain tax positions resulted in no cumulative effect adjustment.  The Company believes its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained upon examination and, accordingly, no reserves or related accruals for interest and penalties have been recorded at August 31, 2016 or February 29, 2016.  In accordance with the guidance, the Company has adopted a policy under which, if required to be recognized in the future, interest related to the underpayment of income taxes will be classified as a component of interest expense and any related penalties will be classified in operating expenses in the statements of operations.  The Company has three open years of tax returns subject to examination. 
   
    Stock-Based Compensation, Including Options and Warrants    
   
 The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation plans and awards in operations on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period of the awards.  The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. The compensation expense for the Company's stock-based payments is based on estimated fair values at the time of the grant. 
   
 The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This option pricing model involves a number of assumptions, including the expected lives of stock options, the volatility of the public market price for the Company's common stock and interest rates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest. 
   
    Advertising    
   
 Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. The Company did not incur any advertising expense during the quarters ended August 31, 2016 or August 31, 2015.  
   
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
   
 In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires that inventory be measured within the scope of the Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU conforms with the Company's current protocol for evaluating inventory and the Company will prospectively implement adoption of this ASU. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
   
 On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company has elected not to early adopt ASU 2015-03. 
   
 Management does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the financial statements.  

10 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
   
  Note 3. Going Concern   
   
 The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a working capital deficit, recurring losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  
   
 At August 31, 2016 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $33,084,039.  The Company anticipates that expected future proceeds from additional financing through the sale of its common stock or other equity-based securities, and additional sales and/or leases of existing domain names will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs through at least August 31, 2017.  In the event that the Company is unable to obtain additional capital in the future, the Company would be forced to further reduce operating expenses and/or cease operations altogether. 
   
  Note 4. Property and Equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are as follows: 

Depreciation expense for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1,770 and $1,818, respectively.  
   
  Note 5. Prepaid Domain Names  
   
 During the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $57,500 and $127,005, respectively, of annual domain name renewal fees and has expensed $33,997 and $87,023, respectively, to cost of revenues on a straight-line basis. The amounts paid for the annual domain name renewal fees were paid directly to Epik, LLC, a company which is controlled by Robert Monster, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Epik, LLC, then uses those funds to directly pay Verisign and ICANN companies for the annual domain renewal costs of $7.85 and $0.25, respectively, per domain name. 
   
  Note 6. Accrued Expenses  
   
   Deferred Compensation to Former officer   
   
 From time to time, Richard Pomije, the former CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Company elected to forego a portion of his salary  due to the Company's limited operating funds.  On May 11, 2015, Mr. Pomije agreed to accept a stock subscription receivable in lieu of his deferred officer accrued compensation. The total balance recorded as deferred officer compensation at May 11, 2015 was $331,849. As a result of the difference between the amount recorded for stock subscriptions receivable and deferred officer compensation, the Company recorded a loss on conversion of deferred officer compensation into equity of $293,633 in May 2015. See Notes 9 and 15 for further information. 

11 

On May 18, 2015, Richard Pomije resigned from the Company.  At that time, the Board of Directors was aware of no continuing employment agreement.  The Company released Mr. Pomije on September 11, 2015 concurrent with closing of the Burnsville, MN office.  However, Mr. Pomije is asserting a continuing obligation of the Company in the form of a monthly salary for a 1 year term from May 18, 2015 to May 17, 2016 is due in addition to the stock subscription receivable. The Company has accrued a liability of $95,798 as of February 29, 2016 and August 31, 2016. 
   
   Accrued Salary   
   
 On February 10, 2016, Robert W. Monster, CEO converted $129,231 of his accrued salary into 1,292,310 common shares and 1 year stock options with an exercise price of $0.15. The shares and warrants were valued on the conversion date in the amounts of $109,846 and $19,385, respectively. As the value of the shares and warrants equaled the conversion amount of accrued salary, no gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction. As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the accrued salary owed to Robert Monster was $20,000 and $0, respectively. 
   
   Deferred Revenue   
   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company signed two customer agreements to perform digital support and construction services for two separate un-related companies. Each customer agreement consists of milestones and completion metrics to ensure that the requested services have been performed satisfactorily and to the customers' full expectations. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has collected $70,000 in cash and recorded $110,000 in accounts receivable from these two companies in order to fund the completion of each contract; however, as the services requested by the customers have not yet been completed, the revenue has been recorded as deferred revenue as of August 31, 2016.

Note 8. Stock Options   
   
 The Company has one stock option plan called The 2006 Employee Stock and Option Plan. As of August 31, 2016, an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock may be granted under this plan and must  be approved by the Board of Directors. The stock options may be granted to officers and employees of the Company. Options granted under this plan are non-qualified stock options and have exercise prices and vesting terms established by the Board of Directors at the time of each grant. Vesting terms of the outstanding options range from immediate to four years from the date of grant. The terms of the options range from five to ten years from the date of grant. 
   
 The Company records its stock-based compensation arrangements by calculating the fair value of share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values.  The fair value of the Company's stock options have been estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model, which requires assumptions as to expected dividends, the options expected life, volatility and risk-free interest rate at the time of the grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting periods in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
   
 No stock options were granted during the six months ended August 31, 2016.

  Note 10. Income Taxes  
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under standards issued by the FASB. Under those standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax benefits or consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized through future operations. 
   
 No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded due to the net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately $10,275,069 as of August 31, 2016 that will be offset against future taxable income. The available net operating loss carry forwards will expire in various years through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the future tax loss carry forwards. 
   
 The actual income tax provisions differ from the expected amounts calculated by applying the statutory income tax rate to the Company's loss before income taxes. The components of these differences are as follows at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016:

  Company Overview   
   
  GENERAL  
   
 DigitalTown is building the leading platform for hosted Smart City Management. Our easy to use tools make it easy for the cities and municipalities to build and manage a feature-rich Smart City for web and mobile devices.  This, in turn, provides residents and visitors with 24/7 access to Content, Community and Commerce. 
   
  Market Opportunity  
   
 DigitalTown provides an integrated search, community and commerce platform for both web and mobile devices. DigitalTown powers connected online communities that enable members of a community to find information, and acquire the goods and services they need locally where possible. The DigitalTown platform changes how the local economy consumes and transacts. It does this by helping local community members to  See the World through local eyes . Residents and visitors are able to use a DigitalTown powered search engine to access content, community and commerce from an easy search tool. If there are local vendors that can fulfill a product or service that relates to a search term, then these options are presented to the user. Local vendors can also become direct merchants on the platform, effectively allowing the local town to be its own  Amazon . 
   
  The Strategic Importance of Local Online Economic Development  
   
 The DigitalTown platform elevates local communities to an advanced state of technical capability. Whereas most cities have historically taken a hands-off approach towards the Internet, city management now looks at the Internet as an integral part of the city s strategic plan for economic wellbeing. 
   
 The continued rapid expansion of big box retailers and steep growth of national eCommerce creates increasing pressure on locally owned small businesses. This dual threat requires a new approach to online economic development  one that equips local merchants with the means to compete locally as well as sell nationally cost-effective. 
   
  Why the DigitalTown solution makes sense now  
   
 The DigitalTown platform is a cost effective solution for enabling and community to become a smart community, connected to shared content and local commerce. A key enabler for this capability is the rapid adoption of SmartPhones that are powered by common frameworks, notably Apple iOS and Android. The result is that nearly every adult is now able to communicate and transact in real-time using their SmartPhone as a proxy of their identity,  

24 

reputation, preferences and methods of payment. In effect, the SmartPhone has become the Digital Wallet. The massive early success of Uber has proven that the consumer is ready to use their Digital Wallet as a means for interacting and transacting with other members of a digitally connected community. We believe this opportunity is global and goes beyond ride-sharing. The missing ingredient in many cases is the presence of a trusted platform that connects stakeholders. We further believe that our approach which emphasizes public-private partnerships will enable accelerated adoption particularly in rural communities where trust of technology is lower and yet where economic models are at greatest risk. 
   
  How the DigitalTown SmartCity Platform is part of the new SmartWeb  
   
 A core component of the DigitalTown approach is to build branded web destinations that are intuitive to discover. Part of what makes this possible is the emergence of new domain extensions that are descriptive. For example, .CITY routes a visitor to a website about a city and .MENU routes a user to a website about restaurants in that city. Due to management's long-standing relation with domain registry operators, the Company will seek to bring structure to the emerging landscape of new domain extensions, while at the same time emphasizing distribution of a unified mobile application to work as a digital companion alongside the growing network of direct navigation brands. 
   
  The DigitalTown Platform  
   
 DigitalTown platform creates powerful online and mobile communities. We tap into locally relevant news and content in order to keep community members informed and aware. We provide community tools to keep community members connected. We enable commerce and fulfillment in local communities thereby helping residents to buy locally while equipping merchants to sell both locally and globally. 
   
  Content Search  
   
 The DigitalTown search engine is at the core of the local experience. Whereas most residents may go once or twice per year to the official city site, the DigitalTown-powered search engine is designed for daily use as a preferred homepage for local residents and businesses. 
   Community   
   
 Consumers are already familiar with social networking through applications like Facebook and Twitter. The integrated DigitalTown web service and mobile app make it easy to stay informed, as well as to connect with and communicate with other members of the Leavenworth community. Community members can message, join groups, shop online, make payments, and even have the option of sharing their physical location with other members of the community. 
   
  Commerce  
   
 The DigitalTown platform provides merchants with turn-key solutions for online commerce. Approved merchants can begin selling immediately without any setup cost or fixed costs of any kind. Transaction processing services are provided by DigitalTown, thereby eliminating the need for each retailer to secure a merchant processing account. The community may also enable a private currency for use within the community. 
   
  Courier Management  
   
 An integrated courier application is included, enabling approved couriers to be notified about items from merchants to be picked up and delivered to the customer, thereby enabling any approved merchant to also offer delivery services to the end-customer. 
   
  Administration  
   
 The DigitalTown platform provides integrated administrative tools for managing Content, Community and Commerce, making it easy to administer all aspects of the online economy. The administrative tools are designed from the ground up to be the back end of a smart community. For example, administrators can create Frequently  

25 

Asked Questions (FAQ) that are then intelligently presented through the site search. For example, a question about  Where do I get a fishing license?  can be answered in the form of a pre-written FAQ article. This FAQ article is then intelligently suggested when someone types a fishing-related keyword into the search box on the site, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
   
  Intellectual Property  
   
  Domain Name Portfolio  .  The Company is developing a proprietary platform for Smart City Management.  As part of this platform rollout, the Company has secured approximately 12,000 of the .CITY domains that  map to significant population centers.  DigitalTown has methodically secured the .CITY domains through both acquisition from existing registrants, or via direct purchase from the operator of the .CITY registrar. 
   
  Software  :  The Company has developed a proprietary platform for enabling any city to become a Smart City, incorporating advanced features for economic development, community engagement and digital inclusion.  In  addition  the Company has completed acquisitions of 3 software companies: Cloud.Market, Software Masters, Inc and Reserve Ltd, each of which brought significant intellectual property and has been integrated into the DigitalTown platform.  The Company continues to invest in software with an emphasis on capital efficiency and return on investment.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
   
 SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 
   
 The Company's cash position at August 31, 2016, was $65,115, a decrease of $69,354 from $134,469 at February 29, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, was $594,854 and $549,616, respectively. When comparing the two periods, the increase in cash used in operating activities of $45,238 is mainly due to an increase in deferred revenue of $180,000 and an increase in accounts receivable of $110,000. 
   
 Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was $34,000 and $0, respectively.  
   
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended August 31, 2016 was $559,500 which consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock. For the comparable period ended August 31, 2015, the Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $541,750 which consisted of proceeds from a related party note payable of $15,000, payments on related party notes payable of $90,000 and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $616,750. 
   
 Monthly cash operating expenses for the six months ended August 31, 2016, were approximately $110,000 per month. Based on current projections, the Company's monthly cash operating expenses going forward should be approximately $100,000 per month. In addition to the normal monthly operating expenses, the Company's committed cash requirements for the 12 months ending August 31, 2017 include the balance due of $30,000 for expenses pertaining to the Company's Strategic Partnership Agreement with the NIAAA and $22,500 pertaining to a software development maintenance agreement. From September 1, 2016 to October 10, 2016, the Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the sale of its common stock.  
   
  Prior to May 11, 2015, the Company had the 2007 and 2010 stock subscription agreements outstanding. See Notes 8 and 12 to the current period's consolidated financial statements for further information. 
   
 For the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company did not receive any stock subscription payments. 
   
 In summary, we believe our current cash reserves, future proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and proceeds from the sale and/or lease of current domain names should be sufficient to enable us to operate for the next 12 months. In the event that we are unable to raise additional capital through the sale of our common stock or sell and/or lease additional domain names on acceptable terms, we would be forced to reduce operating expenses and/or cease operations altogether. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 The discussion and analysis of DigitalTown, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect  

27 

the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While DigitalTown Inc.'s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to its consolidated financial statements, management believes the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: 
   
  Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation plans and awards in operations on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period of the awards.  The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. The compensation expense for the Company's stock-based payments is based on estimated fair values at the time of the grant. 
   
 The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This option pricing model involves a number of assumptions, including the expected lives of stock options, the volatility of the public market price for the Company's common stock and interest rates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 Information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the current period's consolidated financial statements.  
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
   
 Any statements contained herein related to future events are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. DigitalTown, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect actual events. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 The Company has not entered into, and does not expect to enter into, financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes. The Company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swap and/or similar instruments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would only impact interest income earned on such instruments. As of August 31, 2016, the Company did not have any material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure.  
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
   
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of August 31, 2016, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13(a)-13(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ). The purpose of this evaluation was to determine whether as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ( SEC ), under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, our management has concluded, as previously discussed in Item 9A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, that material weaknesses continue to exist in our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, and as a result  

28 

our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that continue to exist as of August 31, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). 
   
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. 
   
 Management continues to evaluate the Company's internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that the design and implementation of corrective procedures are adequate to remediate the previously identified material weaknesses from our Form 10-K at February 29, 2016. Due to the small number of employees dealing with general administrative and financial matters and the expenses associated with increases to remediate the disclosure controls and procedures that have been identified, the Company continued to operate without changes to its internal controls over financial reporting for the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q while continuing to evaluate and improve to remediate the material weaknesses at an appropriate cost benefit basis. 
   
 During the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2016, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
   PART II   
   
  ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 DigitalTown, Inc. is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the normal course of its business. The Company believes that none of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  
   
 The most significant risk factors applicable to the Company are described in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
   
 During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company entered into stock purchase agreements for total cash proceeds of $559,500.  
   
  ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES  
   
 None. 
   
  ITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES  
   
 Not applicable. 
   
  ITEM 5.  OTHER INFORMATION  

(a)  
   All information required to be disclosed on a report on Form 8-K during the period ended August 31, 2016, has previously been reported. 

(b)  
   There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors.
