The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Enzo Biochem, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Enzo Life Sciences, Enzo Clinical Labs, Enzo Therapeutics and
Enzo Realty LLC, collectively or with one or more of its subsidiaries referred to as the  Company  or  Companies .
The consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2016, the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),
and cash flows for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated
statement of stockholders  equity for the three months ended October 31, 2016 (the  interim statements ) are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly
the financial position and operating results for the interim periods have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosure,
normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, have been condensed or omitted. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended July 31, 2016 and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The consolidated balance sheet at July 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements
at that date. The results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017. 

Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 . ASU
2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under
this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 implements a five-step process for customer
contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also
requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with
customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value
of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies
are resolved in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019 and the Company does
not expect to early adopt for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities can transition to the standard either
retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We expect to use retrospective adoption. We are
currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances.
The new standard is effective for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this update to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03  Interest  
Imputation of Interest.  The ASU was issued as part of the Simplification Initiatives, to simplify presentation of debt issuance
costs. The amendments in the update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition
and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. We adopted this standard for
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017. The adoption of this update did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements
for the period ended October 31, 2016. We did not present unamortized debt issuance costs related to our Credit Agreement of $7
and $28 as of October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, respectively, as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the debt liability
because the impact was immaterial. These balances are included in prepaid expenses. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying
the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330).  ASU 2015-11 changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost
or market to lower of cost or net realizable value. We adopted this standard for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017. The adoption
of this update did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period ended October 31, 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) No. 2016-02    Leases (Topic 842) . The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that
requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the
income statement. The new standard is effective for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2020 including interim periods within that
fiscal year. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at,
or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
expedients available. While we are evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on our consolidated financial statements,
we expect that upon adoption we will recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities in amounts that will be material. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which requires all excess tax benefits or deficiencies to be recognized
as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. In addition, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other
income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Application of the standard is required for our
annual and interim periods beginning August 1, 2017. We do not expect to early adopt the standard. We are currently evaluating
the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU no. 2016-13,   Financial
Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   ASU 2016-13 introduces
a new forward-looking  expected loss  approach, to estimate credit losses on most financial assets and certain other
instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations
of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements
to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected
credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company s fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, and the guidance is to be applied
using the modified-retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on
our consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2   Net income (loss) per share  

Basic net income (loss) per share represents net income (loss)
divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As a result of the net loss for the three
months ended October 31, 2016 diluted weighted average shares outstanding are the same as basic weighted average shares outstanding,
and do not include the potential common shares from stock options and unvested restricted stock because to do so would be antidilutive. 

For the three months ended October 31, 2016, the number of potential
common shares ( in the money options ) and unvested restricted stock excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
per share was 720,000. For the three months ended October 31, 2015, approximately 125,000 weighted average stock options were included
in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 

For the three months ended October 31, 2015, the effect of approximately
374,000 of outstanding  out of the money  options to purchase common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted
net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. There were no outstanding  out of the money  options
to purchase common shares for the three months ended October 31, 2016. 

Note 3 - Supplemental disclosure for statement of cash flows  

For the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, income
taxes paid by the Company were $954 and $27, respectively .  

For the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, interest
paid by the Company was $58 and $41, respectively. 

For the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company
financed $69 and $38 respectively, in machinery and transportation equipment under installment loans. 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Company did
not enter into any capital lease agreements. During the three months ended October 31, 2015, there was a total of $157 in capital
lease agreements. 

Note 4 - Inventories  

Inventories consist of the following: 

Note 5   Goodwill and intangible assets  

At October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, the Company s net
carrying amount of goodwill, related to the Clinical Labs segment, is $7,452. 

The Company s change in the net carrying amount of intangible
assets, all in the Life Sciences segment is as follows: 

Intangible assets, all finite lived, consist of the following: 

At October 31, 2016, information with respect to intangibles

      10 years  
       
      3 years  

At October 31, 2016, the weighted average useful life of intangible
assets is approximately three years. 

Note 6 - Loan Payable  

On June 7, 2013, the Company entered into a secured Revolving
Loan and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, with Enzo Therapeutics
as a guarantor, and MidCap Financial LLC. (formerly Healthcare Finance Group, LLC). The Credit Agreement, which expired on December
7, 2016, provides for borrowings against eligible US receivables, as defined, of the Clinical Lab and Life Science segments up
to $8.0 million at defined eligibility percentages and provides for additional borrowings of $4.0 million for increased eligible
assets. Debt issuance costs of $281 are being amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement. The balance of unamortized debt
issuance cost was $7 and $28 at October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, respectively, and 

is included in prepaid expenses. Interest on advances, payable
monthly, is based on the three month LIBOR rate, with a floor of 1.25% plus an applicable margin of 4.0%. The nominal interest
rate for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 and year ended July 31, 2016 was 5.25%. In the event of any default, the interest rate
may be increased 3.0% over the current rate. The facility also carries a non-utilization fee of 0.50% per annum, payable monthly,
on the unused portion of the credit line. The effective interest rate for the credit agreement was 12.1% for the quarter ended
October 31, 2016 and 11.4% for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. The Credit Agreement requires a minimum borrowing of $2.0 million.
At October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, the borrowings under the Credit Agreement related to the Clinical Labs and Life Sciences
receivables aggregated $2.0 and $1.6 million, respectively, with an additional availability of $3.5 million at October 31, 2016. 

The Credit Agreement expired and was repaid in full on December
7, 2016. 

The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement were
secured by primarily all the unencumbered U.S. assets of the Company, excluding buildings and intellectual property which the Lender
has a negative pledge, and the capital stock of subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default and requires maximum levels of cash usage and minimum levels of liquidity, as defined, and provides
for increased liquidity levels if operating results are not achieved. Negative covenants include among others, limitations on additional
debt, liens, loans or investments, distributions, asset sales and affiliate transactions. Events of default include non-payment
of principal and interest on debt outstanding, non-performance of covenants, material change in business, breach of representations,
bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments and changes in control. As of October 31, 2016, the Company is in compliance with
the financial covenants. 

The Credit Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default. The terms of the debt covenants include: 

o  The minimum balance the Company must borrow at any time is $2.0 million. At October 31, 2016, the loan balance was approximately
$2.0 million, with an additional availability of $3.5 million.   

o  The Company must maintain a Minimum Liquidity, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not less than $3.0 million. At October
31, 2016, the Company s Minimum Liquidity was $7.6 million.   

o  The quarterly Cash Burn, as defined in the Credit Agreement, must be greater than zero. During the three months ended October
31, 2016, the Cash Burn was positive in the amount of $0.8 million.   

As of October 31, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to redefine
Cash Burn and add a definition for Liquidity (the  amendment ). Under the amendment, the determination of Cash Burn
during a fiscal quarter excludes capital expenditures provided that Liquidity exceeds $7 million as of the last day of the fiscal
quarter. As of October 31, 2016, Liquidity as defined was $70.7 million. 

Note 7   Accrued Liabilities and Other Current Liabilities  

Accrued liabilities consist of the following: 

Note 8   Other Liabilities  

Other liabilities consist of the following: 

As of October 31, 2016, future minimum payments under the capital
leases, net of interest of $254 aggregates $987 including a short term debt portion of $298 included in other current liabilities.
Future minimum payments under the installment loans aggregate $341, including a short term portion of $227 included in other current
liabilities. A total of $0.8 million is included in other current liabilities and in other liabilities as accrued legal settlement
which is further discussed in Note 12 - Contingencies. 

Note 9   Stockholders  Equity  

Controlled Equity Offering   

On March 28, 2013, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity
Offering SM  Sales Agreement (the  Sales Agreement ) with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co., as sales agent ( Cantor ).
Under the Sales Agreement, the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor, shares of the Company s common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Common Stock ), having an aggregate offering price of up to $20.0 million (the
 Shares ). The Company will pay Cantor a commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds received under the Sales
Agreement. The Company is not obligated to make any sales of the Shares under the Sales Agreement. The offering of Shares pursuant
to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (a) the sale of all of the Shares subject to the Sales Agreement or (b)
the termination of the Sales Agreement by Cantor or the Company, as permitted therein. 

On December 31, 2014, the Sales Agreement was amended in order
for the Company to offer and sell, through Cantor, acting as agent, additional shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering
price of $20.0 million. In connection with the amendment to the Sales Agreement, the Company also filed with the Security and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) a prospectus supplement dated December 31, 2014. 

Most recently with respect to the Sales Agreement, the Company
filed a  shelf  registration and prospectus supplement dated September 1, 2016 which was declared effective by the
SEC on November 3, 2016. 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Company did not sell any shares of Common Stock under the Sales Agreement. 

Share-based compensation   

The Company has an incentive stock option and restricted stock
award plan (the  2005 Plan ), and a long term incentive share award plan, (the  2011 Incentive Plan ),
which are more fully described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. The 2011 Plan, which is the only plan from which awards may now be granted,
provides for the award to eligible employees, officers, directors, consultants and other persons of stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock-based awards. 

The amounts of share-based compensation expense recognized in
the periods presented are as follows: 

The following table sets forth the amount of expense related
to share-based payment arrangements included in specific line items in the accompanying statements of operations: 

No excess tax benefits were recognized during the three month
periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

Stock Option Plans   

The following table summarizes stock option activity during the
three month period ended October 31, 2016: 

As of October 31, 2016, the total future compensation cost related
to non-vested options, not yet recognized in the statements of operations, was $0.6 million and the weighted average period over
which the remaining expense of these awards is expected to be recognized is thirteen months. 

The intrinsic value of in the money stock option awards that
are vested at the end of the period represents the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in
excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options that vested. 

Restricted Stock Awards   

A summary of the activity pursuant to the Company s unvested
restricted stock awards for the three months ended October 31, 2016 is as follows: 

The fair value of a restricted stock award is determined based
on the closing stock price on the award date. As of October 31, 2016, there was approximately $0.1 million of unrecognized compensation
cost related to unvested restricted stock-based compensation to be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of approximately
thirteen months. 

The fair value of the awards that vested during the three months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $8 and $21, respectively. 

The total number of shares available for grant as equity awards
from the 2011 Incentive Plan is approximately 823,000 shares as of October 31, 2016. 

Note 10 - Income taxes  

At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates
its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimate is used to determine the income tax provision
or benefit on a year-to-date basis and may change in subsequent interim periods. 

The Company s effective tax rate provision for the three
months ended October 31, 2016 was 1.4% compared to 1.9% for the three months ended October 31, 2015. The tax provision for the
periods was based on state, local and foreign taxes. The Company s effective tax rate for both periods differed from the
expected net operating loss carryforward benefit at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% primarily due to the inability to recognize
such benefit. The carryforward benefit cannot be recognized because of uncertainties relating to future taxable income in terms
of both its timing and its sufficiency, which would enable the Company to realize the federal carryforward benefit. 

The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. The
Company files combined returns with California, Michigan and New York State and City for certain subsidiaries. Other subsidiaries
file separate state and foreign tax returns. 

Note 11   Segment reporting  

The Company has three reportable segments: Clinical Labs, Life
Sciences, and Therapeutics. The Clinical Labs segment provides diagnostic services to the health care community. The Life Sciences
segment develops, manufactures, and markets products to research and pharmaceutical customers. The Therapeutic segment conducts
research and development activities for therapeutic drug candidates. 

The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment income
(loss) before taxes. Costs excluded from segment income (loss) before taxes and reported as  Other  consist of corporate
general and administrative costs which are not allocable to the three reportable segments. Legal fee expense incurred to defend
the Company s intellectual property and other general corporate matters is considered a component of the Other segment. Legal
fee expense specific to other segments  activities has been allocated to those segments. Legal settlements, net represent
activities for which royalties would have been received by the Company s Life Sciences segment had the Company had agreements
in place with plaintiffs for the patents or products covered by the settlements. 

Management of the Company assesses assets on a consolidated basis
only and, therefore, assets by reportable segment have not been included in the reportable segments below. The accounting policies
of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies contained in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016. 

The following financial information represents the operating
results of the reportable segments of the Company: 

Three months ended October 31, 2016  

Three months ended October 31, 2015  

Note 12   Contingencies   

On June 7, 2004, the Company and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.,
filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Applera Corporation and its
wholly-owned subsidiary Tropix, Inc., which became Life Technologies, Inc. and was acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.
(NYSE:TMO) on February 3, 2014. The complaint alleged infringement of six patents relating to DNA sequencing systems,
labeled nucleotide products, and other technology. Yale University is the owner of four of the patents and the Company is the
exclusive licensee. These four patents are commonly referred to as the  Ward  patents. On November 12, 2012, a
jury in New Haven found that one of these patents (United States Patent No. 5,449,667) was infringed and not proven invalid.
The jury awarded $48.5 million for this infringement. On January 6, 2014, the judge awarded prejudgment
interest of approximately $12.5 million and additional post-interest on the full amount was also be awarded
starting November 7, 2012 until the total award is satisfied.  The final award to the Company could have been
reduced or subject to possible claims from third parties. On March 16, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
vacated that judgment in a decision remanding the matter to the district court for further proceedings.  On February 22,
2016, the Connecticut District Court granted Applera s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement.  The
Company appealed that decision. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this litigation. Even if the
Company is not successful, management does not believe that there will be a significant adverse monetary impact on the
Company. 

As of August 1, 2014 the Company was engaged in litigation in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Roche Diagnostic GmbH and its related company Roche
Molecular Systems, Inc. ( Roche ), as declaratory judgment defendant. This case was commenced in May 2004. Roche seeks
a declaratory judgment of non-breach of contract and patent invalidity against the Company. Roche has also asserted tort claims
against the Company. The Company has asserted breach of contract and patent infringement causes of action against Roche. There
has been extensive discovery in the case. In 2011, Roche moved for summary judgment of non-infringement regarding the Company s
patent claims. In 2012, the motion was granted in part and denied in part. In December 2012, Roche moved for summary judgment
on the Company s non-patent claims. Additional discovery was taken and the Company responded to the motions in May 2013.
On December 6, 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part Roche s summary judgment motion. On October 22, 2014,
the Court ordered that damages discovery concerning the Company s remaining contract and patent claims and Roche s
claims should be completed by January 30, 2015, and expert discovery should be completed following the Court s not-yet-issued
claim construction ruling concerning the Company s patent infringement claim against Roche. Roche dropped its tort claims
during damages discovery. On April 28, 2015, the Court heard oral argument on claim construction issues. On May 8, 2015, Roche
and the Company jointly moved the Court to extend the schedule for damages discovery until May 29, 2015, and the Court granted
that motion. The parties are waiting for the Courts  ruling on claim construction. The Company and Enzo Life Sciences intend
to vigorously press their remaining claims and contest the claims against them. 

In 2012, the Company received a Subpoena Duces Tecum (the  Subpoena )
from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General ( OIG ). The Subpoena was issued as
part of an investigation being conducted by the US Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of New York in conjunction
with the OIG. While a number of potential issues were raised initially by the government, the investigation came to focus primarily
on an alleged failure to collect diagnosis codes from physicians who ordered tests through Enzo Clinical Labs. The time period
initially covered by the investigation was from 2004 through 2011. In response to the Subpoena, the Company cooperated with the
government. On September 22, 2014, the Company and the U.S. Department of Justice reached a settlement agreement to resolve this
matter, in substantive form as disclosed in the Company s fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2014. During the quarter ended
April, 30, 2014, the Company recorded a charge of $2.0 million in the statement of operations under legal settlements, net within
the Clinical Labs segment. The settlement amount is being paid with interest over a five-year period. The final settlement covers
the time period 2004-2014. During the three months ended January 31, 2016, the Company accrued an additional $1.5 million, due
to the Company s achievement of certain financial milestones. As of October 31, 2016, the total liability for this settlement
is $0.8 million, of which $0.4 million is included in other current liabilities and $0.4 million included in other liabilities. 

On June 20, 2014, the Company, as plaintiff finalized and executed
a settlement agreement with PerkinElmer, Inc., and PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. (formerly known as PerkinElmer Life Sciences,
Inc.) (together,  PerkinElmer ), with respect to an action between the Company and PerkinElmer before the U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, Case No 03-CV-3817. PerkinElmer paid $7.0 million in escrow pursuant to the agreement because
of a former attorney s charging lien for fees allegedly owed for past services rendered to the Company. On December 3, 2015,
the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement with the former attorney pursuant to which the Company and the former attorney
resolved their respective claims against each other. As of July 31, 2016, the Company received a total of approximately $7.0 million
from the escrow referred to above in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement which was included in the statement
of operations under Legal settlements, net within the Life Science segment in that period. 

On July 2, 2015, the Company as Plaintiff executed a settlement
agreement with Luminex Corporation with respect to an action between the Company and Abbott Laboratories and Abbott Molecular,
Inc. (Defendants) and Luminex Corporation (Intervening Defendant) before the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware for alleged patent infringement. Luminex paid the Company a total of $7.1 million as consideration for this agreement
and the dismissal of the litigation against Luminex. The case against the Abbott defendants continues. The parties have not begun
summary judgement briefing because the court has not set a briefing schedule. The court also has not set a trial date. 

On July 20, 2015, the Company as a Plaintiff finalized and executed
a settlement agreement with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. ( Siemens ) to settle a patent litigation lawsuit
before the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in the amount of $6.7 million, net. Under terms of the agreement,
Siemens will also pay the Company additional royalties of $1.0 million per annum on sales of its molecular products manufactured
and/or sold in the United States during the its fiscal years 2015 through 2019 if sales of such products exceed a contractual
amount. The net settlement amount was included in other receivables in the consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2015 and
was received in August 2015. 

On October 9, 2015, the Company reached and finalized a settlement
with Affymetrix, Inc. in the amount of $6.8 million, net in a patent infringement action brought by the Company. On January 4,
2016, the Company reached and finalized a settlement agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc. in the amount of $6.1 million,
net in a patent infringement action brought by the Company. Both cases were originally brought by the Company in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware. The settlements were included in the statement of operations during the applicable
fiscal period under Legal settlements, net within the Life Science segment. 

On May 16, 2016, the Company reached and finalized a settlement
with Life Technologies Corporation in the amount of $24.3 million, net in an infringement action brought by the Company regarding
its US Patents No. 6,992,180 and 7,064,197. On July 1, 2016, the Company reached and finalized a settlement with Illumina, Inc.,
in the amount of $14.5 million, net in an infringement action brought by the Company regarding US Patent No. 7,064,197. These
cases were originally brought by the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The settlements
are included in the statement of operations under Legal settlements, net within the Life Science segment. 

As of October 31,
2016, there are seven pending cases originally brought by the Company in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging patent infringements against various companies.   For the cases involving Gen-Probe/Hologic, Becton
Dickinson, and Roche, the court has set summary judgment briefing deadlines, a summary judgment argument hearing, and trial
dates in October, November and December 2017. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these
litigations. Even if the Company is not successful, management does not believe that there will be a significant adverse
monetary impact on the Company. 

The Company is party to other claims, legal actions, complaints,
and contractual disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that any liability that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its
financial position or results of operations

Results of Operations   

   Three months ended

   (in 000s)   

Comparative Financial Data for the Three Months Ended October 31,  

** not meaningful  

Consolidated Results:  

The  2017 period  and the  2016 period 
refer to the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Clinical laboratory services revenues for the 2017 period were
$18.6 million compared to $17.1 million in the 2016 period, an increase of $1.5 million or 9%. The increase is attributed to molecular
testing volume in women s health markets and new accounts versus the 2016 period. 

Product revenues for the 2017 period were $7.4 million compared
to $7.7 million in the 2016 period, a decrease of $0.3 million or 3%. The decrease was due to lower product order volume of $0.2
million and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of $0.1 million. 

The cost of clinical laboratory services during the 2017 period
was $10.9 million as compared to $10.3 million in the 2016 period, an increase of $0.6 million or 5% primarily due to the increase
in clinical laboratory services revenue from molecular testing. 

The cost of product revenues during the 2017 period was $3.3
million compared to $3.6 million in the 2016 period, a decrease of $0.3 million or 8% due to lower sales. The gross profit margin
was 55% in the 2017 period and 53% in the 2016 period due to a favorable mix of products sold. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately
$11.5 million during the 2017 period versus $10.2 million during the 2016 period, an increase of $1.3 million or 12%. The Clinical
Lab segment selling, general and administrative increased $0.7 million due to sales commissions and compensation and administrative
function salaries in support of greater molecular testing volume, and an increase in collection expenses for self-pay patient
receivables. Other segment selling, general and administrative increased $0.6 million due to increases for salary related expenses
and occupancy costs. 

The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, primarily
related to the Clinical Labs segment, was approximately $0.7 million for both the 2017 and 2016 periods. As a percentage of Clinical
laboratory services, the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable relating to the Clinical Labs segment was 3.6% in the
2017 period and 4.1% in the 2016 period. The decrease is primarily due to enhanced collection procedures for self-pay patient
receivables. 

Legal fee expense was $0.4 million during the 2017 period compared
to $1.6 million in the 2016 period, a decrease of $1.2 million or 77% due to the timing of legal activity and related costs associated
with on-going patent litigation where the Company is plaintiff. 

Legal settlements, net were $6.8 million in the 2016 period,
related to a finalized and executed settlement agreement with Affymetrix, Inc. 

During the 2017 and the 2016 periods, the foreign currency loss
was $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, an unfavorable change of $0.2 million. The Company has loans and receivables
with its foreign subsidiaries which may be denominated in US dollars or a foreign currency. When re-measuring these amounts into
the respective entities  functional currency, the Company recognizes a loss if those foreign currencies, including the Swiss
Franc, British pound and Euro depreciate relative to the US dollar and a gain if those foreign currencies appreciate relative
to the US dollar, year over year. 

As compared to the US dollar at the end of the 2017 period versus
the start of the 2017 period, the Euro and Swiss franc each depreciated approximately 2%, and the British pound almost 8%. As
compared to the US dollar at the end of the 2016 period versus the start of the 2016 period, the Swiss franc and British pound
had only depreciated approximately 2% versus the US dollar and the Euro appreciated slightly, by under 1%. 

Segment Results:  

Clinical Labs   

Revenue from laboratory services for the 2017 period were $18.6
million compared to $17.1 million in the 2016 period. The increase of $1.5 million is attributed to increased molecular testing
volume. Cost of sales during the 2017 period was $10.9 million as compared to $10.3 million in the 2016 period, an increase of
$0.6 million due to higher molecular testing service revenues. Gross profit margin was 41% in the 2017 period and 40% in the 2016
period. As a percentage of revenues, the provision for uncollectable accounts declined to 3.6% versus 4.1% in the 2016 period
and is due to enhanced collection procedures for self-pay patient receivables. Operating income before taxes was $1.1 million
for 2017 period as compared to $0.7 million in the 2016 period, an increase of $0.4 million or 44%. 

Life Sciences   

The 2016 period includes $6.8 million for patent litigation settlements
previously described. Product revenues decreased $0.3 million or 3% in the 2017 period due to declines in product sales of $0.2
million in the United States and foreign markets and the negative impact of $0.1 of foreign currency translation. Product revenues
decreased due to lower order volume from lower research funding, especially in academia, and were also impacted by pricing due
to competition. The segment s gross profit was $4.4 million in the 2017 period, as compared to $4.5 million in the 2016
period, a decrease of $0.1 million primarily due to lower royalty and license fee income of $0.1 million. Due to significantly
larger depreciation of foreign currencies versus the US dollar, in particular the British pound at the end of the 2017 period
versus the start of the 2017 period, the foreign currency loss was $0.3 million compared to a loss of $0.1 million in the 2016
period, an unfavorable change of $0.2 million in the 2017 period. Operating income before taxes was $0.5 million for the 2017
period as compared to $7.5 million for the 2016 period, a decrease of $7.0 million or 94%. 

Therapeutics   

Therapeutics segment s operating loss before income taxes
was approximately $0.2 million in both the 2017 and 2016 periods. 

Other   

The Other segment s operating loss before taxes for the
2017 period was approximately $2.8 million as compared to $3.5 million for the 2016 period, an improvement of $0.7 million. During
the 2017 period, legal fee expense associated with on-going patent litigation declined $1.3 million and interest income increased
$0.1 million, partially offset by an increase in salary related expenses and occupancy costs of $0.7 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At October 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
of $67.2 million of which $0.6 million was in foreign accounts, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $67.8 million, of
which $0.5 million was in foreign accounts at July 31, 2016. It is the Company s current intent to permanently reinvest
these funds outside of the United States, and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United
States operations. The Company had working capital of $69.7 million at October 31, 2016 compared to $70.8 million at July 31,
2016. The decrease in working capital of $1.1 million was primarily due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities.  

Net cash used in operating activities as of October 31, 2016
was approximately $0.3 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $13.2 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease
of approximately $13.5 million. The 2016 period included a net settlement of $6.8 and cash received from a legal settlement of
$6.7 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 and 2016
was approximately $0.5 million which consists of capital expenditures.  

Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was
approximately $0.3 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of $0.1 million in fiscal 2016. The change of $0.4
million is due to an increase in the loan payable under the Credit Agreement in the 2017 period. 

On June 7, 2013, the Company entered into a secured Revolving
Loan and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, with Enzo
Therapeutics as a guarantor, and MidCap Financial Services, LLC (formerly Healthcare Finance Group, LLC). The Credit Agreement,
which expired in December 2016, provides for borrowings against eligible US receivables, as defined, of the Clinical Labs and
Life Sciences segments up to $8.0 million at defined eligibility percentages and provides for additional borrowings of $4.0 million
for increased eligible assets. The Credit Agreement expired and was repaid in full on December 7, 2016. 

At October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 borrowings under the Credit
Agreement related to the Clinical Labs and Life Sciences receivables aggregated $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, with
an additional availability of $3.5 million as of October 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to
add and redefine certain terms used in the Cash Burn covenant calculation, principally the elimination of capital expenditures
from the calculation when Liquidity exceeds $7.0 million. As of October 31, 2016, the Company is in compliance with the modified
financial covenants.  

The Company continued to review all operating units to further
reduce annual operating expenditures in fiscal 2017. While revenues and operating results at the Clinical Labs segment improved,
revenues for the Life Sciences segment declined slightly versus fiscal 2016. If revenues were to significantly decline, the segment
could be required to record impairments of its intangible assets, which last occurred in fiscal 2012. The Company believes that
its current cash and cash equivalents level, and utilization of the Controlled Equity Offering program if necessary, as disclosed
in Form 10-K Note 10 to the financial statements are sufficient for its foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs over
the next twelve (12) months, although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view. Although there can
be no assurances, in the event additional capital is required, the Company believes it has the ability to raise additional funds
through equity offerings or other sources. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those
described in the Item 1A.  Risk Factors  section of our Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016, some of which
are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore
adversely affect our liquidity plans. 

See our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 for
Forward Looking Cautionary Statements. 

Contractual Obligations  

There have been no material changes to our Contractual Obligations
as reported in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. 

Management is not aware of any material claims, disputes or settled
matters concerning third party reimbursement that would have a material effect on our financial statements, except as disclosed
in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statement. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have any  off-balance sheet arrangements 
as such term is defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and results of operations are based upon Enzo Biochem, Inc. s consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. These estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 

On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to contractual expense, allowance for uncollectible accounts, inventory, intangible assets and income taxes. The Company
bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Product revenues   

Revenues from product sales are recognized when the products
are shipped and title transfers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 

Royalties   

Royalty revenues are recorded in the period earned. Royalties
received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenues. 

Revenues   Clinical laboratory services   

Revenues from Clinical Labs are recognized upon completion of
the testing process for a specific patient and reported to the ordering physician. These revenues and the associated accounts
receivable are based on gross amounts billed or billable for services rendered, net of a contractual adjustment, which is the
difference between amounts billed to payers and the expected approved reimbursable settlements from such payers. 

The following table represents the clinical laboratory segment s
net revenues and percentages by revenue category: 

The Company provides services to certain patients covered by
various third-party payers, including the Federal Medicare program. Laws and regulations governing Medicare are complex and subject
to interpretation for which action for noncompliance includes fines, penalties and exclusion from the Medicare programs. See Note
12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other than the Medicare program, one provider whose programs
are included in the  Third-party payers  and  Health Maintenance Organizations  ( HMO s )
categories represents approximately 36% and 29% of the Clinical Labs segment net revenue for the three months ended October 31,
2016 and 2015 respectively. 

Contractual Adjustment   

The Company s estimate of contractual adjustment is based
on significant assumptions and judgments, such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies, and bears the risk of change.
The estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers, versus
the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers. The contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue,
based on gross billing rates, to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed. Gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule
we set for all third party payers, including Medicare, HMO s and managed care. The Company adjusts the contractual adjustment
estimate quarterly, based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers, industry reimbursement
trends, and other relevant factors. 

The other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment
include the monthly and quarterly review of: 1) current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer, 2) current
changes in third party arrangements and 3) the growth of in-network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our
Company. 

Our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon
reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and insurers. We are
subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates.
Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues. The number of individuals covered
under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the
future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care. These trends will continue
to reduce our revenues from these programs. 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the
contractual adjustment percentages, determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics, were 83.7% and 84.5%, respectively,
of gross billings. In general, the Company believes a decline in reimbursement rates or a shift to managed care or similar arrangements
may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of molecular tests we perform. However, there can be no assurance
that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform, that we can maintain
that higher number of tests performed, or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue. 

The Company estimates (by using a sensitivity analysis) that
each 1% point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues
of approximately $1.1million for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and a change in the net accounts receivable
of approximately $0.6 million as of October 31, 2016. 

Our clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross
billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing.
Therefore, we are unable to quantify the effect contractual adjustments recorded during the current period have on revenue recorded
in a previous period. However, we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based
on our quarterly review process, which includes: 

an analysis of industry reimbursement trends;   

an evaluation of third-party reimbursement rates changes and
                                                                changes in reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers;   

a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical claim
                                                                settlement and reimbursement experience statistics with payers;   

an analysis of current gross billings and receivables by payer.   

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of
allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue. 

The following is a table of the Company s net accounts
receivable by segment. The Clinical Labs segment s net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its
total net receivables. At October 31, 2016, and July 31, 2016, approximately 71% of the Company s net accounts receivable
relates to its Clinical Labs business, which operates in the New York and New Jersey medical communities. 

The Life Sciences segment s accounts receivable, of which
$1.1 million or 27% and $1.2 million or 29% represents foreign receivables as of October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, includes royalty
receivables of $0.4 and $0.5 million, as of October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, respectively, from Qiagen Corporation. 

Net accounts receivable  

Changes in the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts
are as follows: 

For the Clinical Labs segment, the allowance for doubtful accounts
represents amounts that the Company does not expect to collect after the Company has exhausted its collection procedures. The Company
estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts in the period the related services are billed and reduces the allowance in future
accounting periods based on write-offs during those periods. It bases the estimate for the allowance on the evaluation of historical
experience of accounts going to collections and the net amounts not received. Accounts going to collection include the balances,
after receipt of the approved settlements from third party payers, for the insufficient diagnosis information received from the
ordering physician which result in denials of payment, and our estimate of the uncollected portion of receivables from self-payers,
including deductibles and copayments, which are subject to credit risk and patients  ability to pay. 

As at October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recategorized to
collections customers whose accounts receivable had been outstanding more than 210 days. The Company fully reserves through its
contractual allowances amounts that have not been written off because the payer s filing date deadline has not occurred or
the collection process has not been exhausted. The Company s collection experience on Medicare receivables beyond 210 days
has been insignificant. The Company adjusts the historical collection analysis for recoveries, if any, on an ongoing basis. 

The Company s ability to collect outstanding receivables
from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows. The primary collection risk lies with uninsured
patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding. The Company also assesses the
current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the
impact, if any, on the allowance estimates, which involves judgment. The Company believes that the collectability of its receivables
is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes, most notably, those related to obtaining the accurate patient information
in order to bill effectively for the services provided. Should circumstances change (e.g. shift in payer mix, decline in economic
conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables), our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by
a material amount. 

Billing for laboratory services is complicated because of many
factors, especially: the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the
various payers we deal with, disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers, and disputes with payers
as to which party is responsible for reimbursement. 

The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total
accounts receivable at October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 was 22.9% and 19.4%, respectively. During the 2017 period a higher allowance
was required due to the volume increase in genetic testing. 

The following table indicates the Clinical Labs aged gross receivables
by payer group which is prior to adjustment to gross receivables for: 1) contractual adjustment, 2) fully reserved balances not
yet written off, and 3) other revenue adjustments. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. The liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards
and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits will be realized in the foreseeable
future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under the liability method, the effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

It is the Company s policy to provide for uncertain tax
positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely
than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability
for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company s effective
tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. 

Inventory  

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or net realizable value, which approximates market. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories consist of material,
labor, and manufacturing overhead. Write downs of inventories to net realizable value are based on a review of inventory quantities
on hand and estimated sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand. Unanticipated changes in demand could
have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and require additional write downs of inventory which would impact our
results of operations. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition
over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Intangible assets (exclusive of patents), arose primarily from acquisitions, and
primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, licenses, and website and database content. Finite-lived intangible assets
are amortized according to their estimated useful lives, which range from 4 to 15 years. Patents represent capitalized legal costs
incurred in pursuing patent applications. When such applications result in an issued patent, the related capitalized costs are
amortized over a ten year period or the life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. The Company reviews
its issued patents and pending patent applications, and if it determines to abandon a patent application or that an issued patent
no longer has economic value, the unamortized balance in deferred patent costs relating to that patent is immediately expensed. 

The Company tests goodwill and long-lived assets annually as
of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing goodwill and
long-lived assets for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the
existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill and long-lived
assets for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it
is required to perform the first step of a two-step quantitative impairment review process. The first step of the quantitative
impairment test requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting
units to their respective carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment
exists and the second step is not performed. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, the second
step must be performed to compute the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any. In the second step, the impairment is computed
by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates resulting from acquisitions with foreign locations (See Item 1A. Risk Factors section of the Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2016) that could impact our results of operations and financial position. We do not currently engage in any
hedging or market risk management tools. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

The financial reporting of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since the functional currency of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency, foreign
currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders 
equity. Assuming a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies at October 31, 2016,
our assets and liabilities would decrease by $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and our net sales and net earnings (loss)
would decrease by $0.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, on an annual basis. 

We also maintain intercompany balances and loans with subsidiaries
in different local currencies. These amounts are at risk of foreign exchange losses if exchange rates fluctuate. Assuming a hypothetical
increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies, our pre-tax earnings (loss) would be unfavorably impacted
by approximately $1.1 million on an annual basis. 

Interest Rate Risk  

We are exposed to interest rate risk with our variable rate Credit
Agreement which bears interest at the three month LIBOR with a floor of 1.25% plus 4% per annum. A 3% change in the LIBOR rate
would impact our interest expense by $0.1 million. The Credit Agreement expired and was repaid in full on December 7, 2016. 

As of October 31, 2016, we have fixed interest rate financing
on transportation and equipment leases. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s
management conducted an evaluation (as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the  Exchange Act )) of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term
is defined under the Exchange Act), under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth
in the Company s periodic reports. 

(b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal controls
over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
