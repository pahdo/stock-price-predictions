1.    Basis of Presentation: 
    
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company and include the accounts of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. ("Advance"), its wholly owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated ("Advance Stores"), and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company, the results of its operations and cash flows have been made. 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, have been condensed or omitted based upon the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") interim reporting guidance. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for   Fiscal 2015   (filed with the SEC on   March 1, 2016  ). 
    
  The accounting policies followed in the presentation of interim financial results are consistent with those followed on an annual basis. These policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report. 
    
  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The first quarter of each of the Company's fiscal years contains 16 weeks. The Company's remaining three quarters consist of 12 weeks. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
    
  Segment and Related Information 
    
  Effective in the second quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its five geographic areas which included the operations of the stores operating under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and Autopart International trade names into three geographic divisions. As a result of this realignment the Company has reduced its number of operating segments from six to four. Each of the Advance Auto Parts geographic divisions, in addition to Worldpac, are individually considered operating segments which continue to be aggregated into one reportable segment. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-3 "Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" effective January 3, 2016, or the beginning of fiscal 2016. ASU 2015-3 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring such costs be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. Concurrently, the Company also adopted ASU 2015-15 "Interest - Imputed Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements" which clarifies that entities may continue to defer and present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The adoption of these ASU's have been retrospectively applied and resulted in a reclassification of   $6,864   of debt issuance costs from Other assets, net to Long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2016. 
    
  The Company adopted ASU 2014-12  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service

Period" effective the beginning of fiscal 2016. The amendments in this ASU require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The adoption of this standard did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements as the Company's policies were already consistent with the new guidance. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The pronouncement provides clarification guidance on eight specific cash flow presentation issues that have developed due to diversity in practice. The issues include, but are not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and cash receipts from payments on beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires businesses to present financial assets, measured at an amortized cost basis, at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables. The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" aimed at simplifying certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. The areas for simplification include the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The standard will be applied both prospectively and retrospectively depending on the provision. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." This ASU is a comprehensive new lease standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. It will require companies to recognize lease assets, and lease liabilities by lessees, for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous lease guidance. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; earlier adoption is permitted. In the financial statements in which the ASU is first applied, leases shall be measured and recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented with an adjustment to equity. Practical expedients are available for election as a package and if applied consistently to all leases. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows but believes the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." Although the ASU retains many of the current requirements for financial instruments, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is

effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." ASU 2015-11 requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, simplifying the current requirement that inventories be measured at the lower of cost or market. The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured using the last-in, first-out method or retail inventory method. The guidance will be effective prospectively for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2016; earlier adoption is permitted. As the majority of the Company's inventory is accounted for under the last-in, first-out method, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." This new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter; earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This ASU, along with subsequent ASU's issued to clarify certain provisions of ASU 2014-09, provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that expands disclosure requirements and requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will become effective during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the year of adoption with public entities permitted to early adopt for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities may choose from two transition methods, with certain practical expedients, a full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential future impact, if any, of this standard on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which method of adoption is most appropriate for the Company. 

2.    Inventories, net: 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company used the LIFO method of accounting for approximately   88%   and   89%   of inventories at   October 8, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively. Under LIFO, the Company s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most recently purchased inventories, while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs for inventories purchased in   Fiscal 2016   and prior years. As a result of changes in the LIFO reserve, the Company recorded a reduction to cost of sales of   $48,675   and   $46,356   for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively. The Company's overall costs to acquire inventory for the same or similar products have generally decreased historically as the Company has been able to leverage its continued growth and execution of merchandising strategies. 
    
  An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is performed by the Company at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected fiscal year-end inventory levels and costs.

Inventory balances at   October 8, 2016   and   January 2, 2016   were as follows: 

3.    Exit Activities: 
    
  Integration of Carquest stores 
    
  The Company approved plans in June 2014 to begin consolidating its Carquest stores acquired with General Parts International, Inc. ( GPI ) on January 2, 2014 as part of a multi-year integration plan. As of   October 8, 2016  ,   316   Carquest stores acquired with GPI had been consolidated into existing Advance Auto Parts stores and   266   stores had been converted to the Advance Auto Parts format. In addition, as of   October 8, 2016   the Company had completed the consolidation and conversion of the stores that were acquired with B.W.P. Distributors, Inc. ("BWP") on December 31, 2012 (which also operated under the Carquest trade name). During the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   a total of   22   Carquest stores were consolidated and   35   Carquest stores were converted. During the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   a total of   139   Carquest stores were consolidated and   107   Carquest stores were converted. Plans are in place to consolidate or convert the remaining Carquest stores over the next few years. As of   October 8, 2016  , the Company had   640   stores still operating under the Carquest name. The Company incurred   $2,192   and   $2,193   of exit costs related to the consolidations and conversions during the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively, and   $17,621   and   $7,202   during the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Contract termination costs, such as those associated with leases on closed stores, are recognized at the cease-use date. Closed lease liabilities include the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management s estimate of future costs of insurance, property tax and common area maintenance (reduced by the present value of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts). 
    
  Office Consolidations 
    
  In June 2014, the Company approved plans to relocate operations from its Minneapolis, Minnesota and Campbell, California offices to other existing offices of the Company, including its offices in Newark, California, Roanoke, Virginia and Raleigh, North Carolina, and to close its Minneapolis and Campbell offices. The Company also relocated various functions between its existing offices in Roanoke and Raleigh. The relocations and office closings were substantially complete by the end of 2015. The Company incurred restructuring costs of approximately   $22,100   under these plans through the end of 2015. Substantially all of these costs were cash expenditures. During the   twelve   and   forty   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  , the Company recognized   $431   and   $3,459  , respectively, of severance/outplacement benefits under these restructuring plans and other severance related to the acquisition of GPI. During the   twelve   and   forty   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  , the Company recognized   $928   and   $3,699   of relocation costs, respectively. 
    
  Other Exit Activities 
    
  As of   October 10, 2015   the Company had completed its plans approved in August 2014 to consolidate and covert its   40   Autopart International ("AI") stores located in Florida into Advance Auto Parts stores. The Company incurred   $2,700   of exit costs associated with this plan during the   forty   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  , consisting primarily of closed facility lease obligations.

Adoption of new accounting pronouncement 
    
  The Company adopted ASU 2015-3 and ASU 2015-15 effective the beginning of fiscal 2016.  ASU 2015-3 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring such costs be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. ASU 2015-15 clarifies that entities may continue to defer and present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. The adoption of these ASU's has been retrospectively applied and resulted in a reclassification of   $6,864   of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Long-term debt as of January 2, 2016. 
    
  Bank Debt 
    
  The Company has a credit agreement (the  2013 Credit Agreement ) which provides a   $1,000,000   unsecured revolving credit facility with Advance Stores, as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub-limit of   $300,000   and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed   $50,000  . The Company may request, subject to agreement by one or more lenders, that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed   $250,000   by those respective lenders (up to a total

commitment of   $1,250,000  ) during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement the revolving credit facility terminates in December 2018.  The 2013 Credit Agreement previously included a term loan, which was repaid in full as of   October 8, 2016  . 
    
  As of   October 8, 2016  , under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under the revolver. As of   October 8, 2016  , the Company had letters of credit outstanding of   $100,719  , which reduced the availability under the revolver to   $899,281  . The letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for the Company s self-insurance policies.  
    
  The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based, at the Company s option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin is   1.10%   and   0.10%   per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. A facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility, payable in arrears. The current facility fee rate is   0.15%   per annum. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the interest rate and facility fee are subject to change based on the Company s credit rating. 
    
  The 2013 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of: (a) subsidiaries of Advance Stores to, among other things, create, incur or assume additional debt; (b) Advance Stores and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur liens, (ii) make loans and investments, (iii) guarantee obligations, and (iv) change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries; (c) Advance, Advance Stores and their subsidiaries to, among other things (i) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and liquidations, (ii) enter into certain hedging arrangements, (iii) enter into restrictive agreements limiting its ability to incur liens on any of its property or assets, pay distributions, repay loans, or guarantee indebtedness of its subsidiaries, and (iv) engage in sale-leaseback transactions; and (d) Advance, among other things, to change its holding company status. Advance and Advance Stores are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio. The 2013 Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults to Advance Stores  other material indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with its covenants with respect to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of   October 8, 2016  . 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
    
  The Company's   4.50%   senior unsecured notes were issued in December 2013 at   99.69%   of the principal amount of   $450,000   and are due December 1, 2023 (the  2023 Notes ). The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of   4.50%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Company's   4.50%   senior unsecured notes were issued in January 2012 at   99.968%   of the principal amount of   $300,000   and are due January 15, 2022 (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of   4.50%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Company s   5.75%   senior unsecured notes were issued in April 2010 at   99.587%   of the principal amount of   $300,000   and are due May 1, 2020 (the  2020 Notes  or collectively with the 2023 Notes and the 2022 Notes,  the Notes ). The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of   5.75%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Advance served as the issuer of the Notes with certain of Advance's domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors. The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the  Indenture ) among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. 
    
  The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at the redemption price described in the Indenture. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture for the Notes), the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors. The Company will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the Notes under the circumstances described in the Indenture: (i) upon the release of the guarantee of the Company s other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt; (ii) upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor; or (iii) upon the Company s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option.

The Indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for: (i) failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable; (ii) failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indenture or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice; (iii) a default under any debt for money borrowed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt, or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than   $25,000   without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by the Company of notice of the default by the Trustee or holders of not less than   25%   in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; and (iv) events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated. The Indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and lease-back transactions. 
    
  Debt Guarantees  
    
  The Company is a guarantor of loans made by banks to various independently-owned Carquest stores that are customers of the Company ("Independents") totaling   $27,258   as of   October 8, 2016  . The Company has concluded that some of these guarantees meet the definition of a variable interest in a variable interest entity. However, the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the Independents and therefore is not the primary beneficiary of these stores. Upon entering into a relationship with certain Independents, the Company guaranteed the debt of those stores to aid in the procurement of business loans. These loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers. The approximate value of the inventory collateralized in these agreements is   $71,741   as of   October 8, 2016  . The Company believes that the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote, and any fair value attributable to these guarantees would be very minimal. 

7.    Fair Value Measurements: 
    
  The Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are grouped in three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets or liabilities. These levels are: 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets and liabilities at the measurement date, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or corroborated by other observable market data. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities that are not able to be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of a reporting entity s own assumptions. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions. 
       
  The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  During the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , the Company had no significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
    
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). During the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , the Company had no significant fair value measurements of non-financial assets or liabilities. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The carrying amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank overdrafts, accounts payable, accrued expenses and the current portion of long term debt approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Company s senior unsecured notes was determined using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices, and the Company believes that the carrying value of its other long-term debt and certain long-term liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of   October 8, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively, are as follows: 

The adoption of ASU 2015-3 resulted in a reclassification of   $6,864   of debt issuance costs from Other assets, net to Long-term debt decreasing the carrying value as of January 2, 2016. 

8.    Stock Repurchases: 
    
  The Company s stock repurchase program allows it to repurchase its common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. The Company's   $500,000   stock repurchase program in place as of   October 8, 2016   was authorized by its Board of Directors on May 14, 2012. 
    
  During the   twelve   and   forty   week periods ended   October 8, 2016   the Company repurchased   no   shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program. The Company had   $415,092   remaining under its stock repurchase program as of   October 8, 2016  .  
    
  The Company repurchased   1   share of its common stock at an aggregate cost of   $121  , or an average price of   $159.16   per share, in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock units during the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  . The Company repurchased   81   shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of   $12,300  , or an average price of   $152.65   per share, in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock units during the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  .  

9.    Earnings per Share: 
    
  Certain of the Company s shares granted to Team Members in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units are considered participating securities which require the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. For the   twelve   week periods ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , earnings of   $520   and   $425  , respectively, were allocated to the participating securities. For the   forty   week periods ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , earnings of   $1,712   and   $1,503  , respectively, were allocated to the participating securities. 
    
  Diluted earnings per share are calculated by including the effect of dilutive securities. Share-based awards to purchase approximately   22   and   1   shares of common stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the common stock during the   twelve   week periods ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. Share-based awards to purchase approximately   22   and   1   shares of common stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the common stock during the   forty

week periods ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. 
    
  The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the   twelve   and   forty   week periods ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  :    

10.   Share-Based Compensation: 
    
  The Company grants share-based compensation awards to its Team Members and members of its Board of Directors as provided for under the Company s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or 2014 LTIP, which was approved by the Company's shareholders on May 14, 2014. Currently, the grants are in the form of stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ("RSUs") and deferred stock units ( DSUs ). 
    
  The Company granted   52   performance-based RSUs,   57   time-based RSUs,   81   performance-based SARs and   69   time-based SARs during the   forty   week period ended   October 8, 2016  . The majority of these grants represent an off-cycle award granted in accordance with the employment agreement reached with the Company s new CEO hired in April 2016. The weighted average fair values of the performance-based and time-based RSUs granted during the   forty   week period ended   October 8, 2016   were   $160.99   and   $156.63   per share, respectively. The fair value of each RSU was determined based on the market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair values of the performance-based and time-based SARs granted during the   forty   week period ended   October 8, 2016   were   $36.58   and   $43.64   per share, respectively.  
    
  The Company also granted a broad-based incentive award to store and field team members of   364   performance-based RSUs during the twelve-week period ended   October 8, 2016  , which vests based on the achievement of performance metrics during the Company's third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2016, subject to a continued one-year service period. The Company expects only   71   of the performance-based RSUs to be earned based on performance. The weighted-average fair value of the performance-based RSUs granted was   $164.36  . The fair value of each performance-based RSU was determined based on the market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant.

The fair value of each SAR was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

(1)   
    The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate having a term consistent with the expected life of the award.  
               (2)   
    Expected volatility is determined using a blend of historical and implied volatility. 
               (3)   
    The expected life of the Company's awards represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of previously granted awards. 
       
  See the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  , for a more detailed discussion regarding the terms of the Company s share-based compensation awards. 
    
  The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis net of estimated forfeitures.  Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Total share-based compensation expense included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations was   $2,522   for the   twelve   week period ended   October 8, 2016   and the related income tax benefit recognized was   $951  . Total share-based compensation expense included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations was   $11,664   for the   forty   week period ended   October 8, 2016   and the related income tax benefit recognized was   $4,252  . As of   October 8, 2016  , there was   $33,263   of unrecognized compensation expense related to all share-based awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.5 years  .   
    
  The aggregate intrinsic value for outstanding awards at   October 8, 2016   was approximately   $88,885   based on the Company's closing stock price of   $148.13   as of the last trading day of the first fiscal quarter ending   October 8, 2016  . For the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , the aggregate intrinsic value for awards exercised was   $68,810  .

12.   Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements: 
    
  Certain 100% wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of Advance, including its Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement) serve as guarantors of Advance's senior unsecured notes ("Guarantor Subsidiaries"). The subsidiary guarantees related to Advance's senior unsecured notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, and there are no restrictions on the ability of Advance to obtain funds from its Guarantor Subsidiaries. Certain of Advance's wholly-owned subsidiaries, including all of its foreign subsidiaries, do not serve as guarantors of Advance's senior unsecured notes ("Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"). The Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries do not qualify as minor as defined by SEC regulations. Accordingly, the Company presents below the condensed consolidating financial information for the Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Investments in subsidiaries of the Company are required to be presented under the equity method, even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under GAAP.  
    
  Set forth below are condensed consolidating financial statements presenting the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of (i) Advance, (ii) the Guarantor Subsidiaries, (iii) the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at consolidated information for the Company. The statement of operations eliminations relate primarily to the sale of inventory from a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary to a Guarantor Subsidiary. The balance sheet eliminations relate primarily to the elimination of intercompany receivables and payables and subsidiary investment accounts.  
    
  The following tables present condensed consolidating balance sheets as of   October 8, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , condensed consolidating statements of operations and comprehensive income for the   twelve   and   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015   and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements herein.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report. Our first quarter consists of 16 weeks divided into four equal periods. Our remaining three quarters consist of 12 weeks with each quarter divided into three equal periods. Unless the context otherwise requires, "Advance," "we," "us," "our," and similar terms refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its predecessor, its subsidiaries and their respective operations.

Introduction 
    
  We are a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America, serving "do-it-for me", or Professional, and "do-it-yourself", or DIY, customers as well as independently-owned operators. As of   October 8, 2016  , we operated a total of   5,058   stores and   127   distribution branches, primarily within the United States, with additional locations in Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our stores operate primarily under the trade names "Advance Auto Parts (AAP)," "Autopart International (AI)" and "Carquest," and our distribution branches operate under the "Worldpac" trade name. In addition, we serve approximately   1,250   independently-owned Carquest stores ("independent stores").  
    
  Our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand name, original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") and private label automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars, vans, sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks. Through our integrated operating approach, we serve our Professional and DIY customers from our store and branch locations and online at www.AdvanceAutoParts.com and www.Worldpac.com.  Our Professional customers, consisting primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver product from our store and branch locations to our Professional customers  places of business, including independent garages, service stations and auto dealers, can conveniently place their orders online through these websites. Our online websites also allow our DIY customers to pick up merchandise ordered online at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them. 

Management Overview 
    
  We generated diluted earnings per share, or diluted EPS, of   $1.53   during our   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   (or the   third   quarter of   Fiscal 2016  ) compared to   $1.63   for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . When adjusted for the following non-operational items, our adjusted diluted earnings per share ("Adjusted EPS") was   $1.73   during the   third   quarter of   Fiscal 2016   compared to   $1.95   during the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  :  

Refer to the   "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"   section for further details of our non-GAAP adjustments. 
    
  The decrease in our diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was driven primarily by declines in our sales and gross profit rate. Our comparable store sales declined   1.0%   compared to the   third   quarter of Fiscal   2015  , but improved sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2016, reflecting improvements in product availability and service levels. We have a number of availability pilots underway and are able to leverage some of the learnings from these pilots immediately, while other aspects will take longer and form part of our availability improvement plan in 2017 and beyond.  In terms of profitability, our results largely reflect the impact of lower gross profit performance in the quarter primarily due to higher supply chain expenses.

Summary of   Third     Quarter Financial Results 
    
  A high-level summary of our financial results for the   third   quarter of   Fiscal 2016   is included below: 

Total sales during the   third   quarter of   Fiscal 2016   were   $2,248.9 million  , a decrease of   2.0%   as compared to the   third   quarter of Fiscal   2015  . This decrease was primarily driven by a comparable store sales decline of   1.0%  , store closures and the effect of Carquest store consolidations.   
                 
    Our inventory balance as of   October 8, 2016   increased   $182.2 million  , or   4.4%  , over our inventory balance as of   January 2, 2016  .  Sequentially, our inventory levels are down from the first quarter.  However, the year-over-year increase in inventory was primarily driven by the build-up of transitional inventory associated with our Carquest store consolidations, the opening of new locations, including a new Worldpac distribution center, and lower than expected sales for the quarter. 
                
    We generated operating cash flow of   $409.4 million   during the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , a decrease of    21.3%   from the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  , primarily due to cash outflows associated with inventory, net of accounts payable. 
       
  Refer to the   "Results of Operations"   and "  Liquidity and Capital Resources"   sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results, respectively. 

Business and Industry Update  
    
  Our focus in 2016 is to regain top line sales growth as the first step towards driving sustainable, long-term performance improvement. Under the leadership of our CEO, who joined the Company in April 2016, we have evaluated all facets of our business in conjunction with the development of a strategic business plan that is intended to significantly improve our customer service and financial performance over the next five years.  
    
  The underlying framework of this plan focuses on growth, productivity and people and culture. The growth and margin expansion elements of our strategic business plan include i) Supply Chain, ii) Professional, iii) DIY and iv) Productivity. This agenda will be supported and executed with a focus on our talent and culture. In 2017, we plan to roll out new supply chain capabilities that will enhance inventory positioning in our network, improve assortment and in-market availability and improve speed and accuracy of delivery. Over the longer-term we will continue to further streamline our supply chain network and systems from the GPI acquisition to enable a more seamless inventory transfer throughout the entire value chain across both corporate and independent stores, driving productivity. The GPI integration plan has been fully embedded in our strategic business plan. For our Professional customers our focus is on providing high quality parts, improved product availability, consistency of service and fast delivery. We will also work to grow our DIY base by providing more relevant services in a consistent fashion across the network and improving both our store and online experience. Our productivity agenda will focus on removing unnecessary costs while driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation.  
    
  Our strategic business plan takes advantage of the favorable industry fundamentals. Operating within the automotive aftermarket industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry. These factors include, but are not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer confidence and competition. We believe the macroeconomic environment should position our industry favorably in 2016 as lower fuel costs, a stabilized labor market and increasing disposable income should help to provide a positive impact. In addition, industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven increasing and the number of vehicles 11 years and older continuing to increase. We believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are (i) the number of miles driven in the U.S. and (ii) the number and average age of vehicles on the road. 
  Favorable industry dynamics include: 

an increase in the number of vehicles and stabilization of the average age of vehicles; 
                
    a long-term expectation that miles driven will continue to increase based on historical trends; and 
                
    a steadily improving job market and lower fuel prices. 
       
  Conversely, the factors negatively affecting the automotive aftermarket industry include: 

deferral of elective automotive maintenance in the near term as more consumers contemplate new automobile purchases; and 

29 

     Table of Contents  

longer maintenance and part failure intervals on newer cars due to improved quality.  
       
  We remain encouraged by the (i) positive fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket industry and (ii) initiatives that we have underway to support our strategic business plan. In the short-term, we are beginning to see favorable results from addressing issues surrounding product availability, service levels and overall execution levels throughout the organization.  

Store Development  
    
  We serve our Professional and DIY customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands. The table below sets  forth detail of our store and branch development activity for the   twelve   and   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , including the consolidation of stores as part of our integration plans and the number of locations with Professional delivery programs. In addition to the changes in our store counts detailed below, during the   twelve   and   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   we relocated   11   and   37   of our stores, respectively.    

   (1)    Includes activity for stores acquired with B.W.P. Distributors, Inc. that operate under the Carquest trade name. 
   (2)    Consolidated stores include Carquest stores whose operations were consolidated into existing AAP locations as a result of the planned integration of Carquest.  
   (3)    Converted stores include Carquest stores that were re-branded as an AAP store as a result of the planned integration of  Carquest.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. During the   twelve   and   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , we consistently applied the critical accounting policies discussed in our   2015   Form 10-K. For a complete discussion regarding these critical accounting policies, refer to the   2015   Form 10-K.

Components of Statement of Operations 
    
  Net Sales 
    
  Net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our store and branch locations to both our Professional and DIY customers, sales from our e-commerce websites and sales to independently-owned Carquest stores. Sales are recorded net of discounts and rebates, sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances. Our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales. We calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store or branch sales starting once a store location has been open for 13 complete accounting periods (approximately one year) and by including e-commerce sales. Sales to independently-owned Carquest stores are excluded from our comparable store sales. We include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening. Acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date (approximately one year).   
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs, net of incentives under vendor programs; inventory shrinkage, defective merchandise and warranty costs; and warehouse and distribution expenses, including depreciation and amortization. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by (i) variations in our product mix, (ii) price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs, (iii) vendor programs, (iv) inventory shrinkage, (v) defective merchandise and warranty costs and (vi) warehouse and distribution costs. We seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long-term purchasing agreements, without minimum purchase volume requirements, when we believe it is advantageous. Our cost of sales and gross profit rates may not be comparable to that of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs and mix of Professional and DIY sales.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  SG A expenses consist of store payroll, store occupancy (including rent and depreciation), advertising expenses, acquisition and integration related expenses, Professional delivery expenses, other store expenses and general and administrative expenses, including salaries and related benefits of store support center Team Members, share-based compensation expenses, store support center administrative office expenses, data processing, professional expenses, self-insurance costs, depreciation and amortization, closed facility expense and impairment charges, if any, and other related expenses. 

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated. 

31 

     Table of Contents  

Net Sales 
    
  Net sales for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   were   $2,248.9 million  , a decrease of   $46.3 million  , or   2.0%  , as compared to net sales for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  . The sales decrease was primarily due to our comparable store sales decrease of   1.0%   and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated.  In addition our store closures, net of new stores, reduced our store count by a net of   four   stores over the last four quarters. While our number of transactions was down during the third quarter, we saw a modest increase in ticket size compared to the prior year. 
    
  Despite improved comparable store sales performance across most of our regions compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, our performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions continued to be disproportionately impacted.  As previously described the change to daily replenishment negatively impacted the operations of the distribution centers in those regions more than anticipated. We are continuing steps to improve fill rates, accuracy rates and overall availability to our stores serviced by these distribution centers and are seeing improvement in these performance metrics. 
    
  Net sales for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   were   $7,484.8 million  , a decrease of   $218.7 million  , or   2.8%  , as compared to net sales for the   forty   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  . The sales decrease was primarily due to our comparable store sales decrease of   2.4%   and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated over the last four quarters.  
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $988.2 million  , or   43.9%   of net sales, as compared to   $1,032.4 million  , or   45.0%   of net sales, for the comparable period of last year, representing a decrease of   104   basis points. The   104   basis-point decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher supply chain costs in our Northeast and Great Lakes distribution centers as we executed planned transitions in delivery frequency in these facilities. In addition, we experienced higher supply chain costs associated with elevated inventory levels earlier in the year.  
    
  Gross profit for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $3,348.4 million  , or   44.7%   of net sales, as compared to   $3,513.6 million  , or   45.6%   of net sales, for the comparable period of last year, representing a decrease of   88   basis points. The   88   basis-point decrease in gross profit rate was similarly driven by higher supply chain costs. 
    
  SG A 
    
  SG A expenses for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   were   $794.4 million  , or   35.3%   of net sales, as compared to   $826.9 million  , or   36.0%   of net sales, for the comparable period of last year, representing a decrease of   70   basis-points. This decrease was primarily the result of lower integration and restructuring related costs during the third quarter of 2016.  Excluding the impact of integration and restructuring related costs, our SG A rate was essentially flat year-over-year reflecting a continued focus on cost discipline offset by costs associated with customer service initiatives.  
    
  SG A expenses for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   were   $2,666.9 million  , or   35.6%   of net sales, as compared to   $2,788.5 million  , or   36.2%   of net sales, for the comparable period of last year, representing a decrease of   57   basis-points. This decrease was driven by factors similar to those described above for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  . 
    
  Operating Income 
    
  Operating income for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $193.8 million  , or   8.6%   of net sales, as compared to   $205.5 million  , or   9.0%   of net sales, for the comparable period of last year. The rate is reflective of a decrease in our gross profit rate partially offset by a decrease in our SG A rate from the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . These changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and SG A drivers previously discussed.  
    
  Operating income for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $681.5 million  , or   9.1%   of net sales, as compared to   $725.1 million  , or   9.4%   of net sales, for the comparable period of last year. The rate is reflective of a decrease in our gross profit rate partially offset by a decrease in our SG A rate from the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . These changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and SG A drivers previously discussed.

Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $13.6 million  , or   0.6%   of net sales, as compared to   $14.4 million  , or   0.6%   of net sales, for the comparable period in Fiscal   2015  . The decrease in interest expense for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year. 
    
  Interest expense for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $46.5 million  , or   0.6%   of net sales, as compared to   $51.6 million  , or   0.7%   of net sales, for the comparable period in Fiscal   2015  . The decrease in interest expense for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $64.0 million  , as compared to   $71.9 million   for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . Our effective income tax rate was   36.0%   and   37.4%   for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the state tax statute expirations and the settlement of a state tax audit during the quarter.  
    
  Income tax expense for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $244.7 million  , as compared to   $250.5 million   for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . Our effective income tax rate was   38.1%   and   37.4%   for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015  , respectively.  The increase in the effective tax rate for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   compared to the comparable period of Fiscal   2015   was primarily due to the accrual of an estimated tax settlement of $7.7 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2016 related to an income tax audit of GPI for time periods prior to our acquisition of GPI. We believe this settlement will be largely recoverable under the escrow for indemnification claims in our purchase agreement with GPI and therefore recorded corresponding income of $6.7 million in Other Income, net. 
    
  Net Income 
    
  Net income for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $113.8 million  , or   $1.53   per diluted share, as compared to   $120.5 million  , or   $1.63   per diluted share, for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . As a percentage of net sales, net income for the   twelve   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   5.1%  , as compared to   5.2%   for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . Negatively impacting diluted EPS and net income in the   third   quarter of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal   2015   were GPI integration, store consolidation and support center restructuring expenses and amortization of intangible assets related to the GPI acquisition of   $23.8 million   and   $38.3 million  , respectively, or   $0.20   and   $0.32   per diluted share, respectively. 
    
  Net income for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   $397.3 million  , or   $5.36   per diluted share, as compared to   $418.6 million  , or   $5.66   per diluted share, for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . As a percentage of net sales, net income for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was   5.3%  , as compared to   5.4%   for the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  . Negatively impacting diluted EPS and net income for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   and   October 10, 2015   were GPI integration, store consolidation and support center restructuring expenses and amortization of intangible assets related to the GPI acquisition of   $94.3 million   and   $112.5 million  , respectively, or   $0.78   and   $0.94   per diluted share, respectively. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"   include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe the presentation of financial results that exclude non-cash charges related to the acquired GPI intangibles and non-operational expenses associated with i) the integration of GPI, ii) store consolidation costs and iii) support center restructuring costs is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size, nature and significance and relate to the integration of GPI and store closure activity in excess of historical levels. These measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry.  The disclosure of these measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management s compensation.  Included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal, recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures are useful to investors as a supplement to the GAAP measures. 

33 

     Table of Contents  

GPI Integration Expenses   - As disclosed in the our filings with the SEC, we acquired GPI for $2.08 billion on January 2, 2014 and are in the midst of a multi-year integration plan to integrate the operations of GPI with Advance Auto Parts. This includes the integration of product brands and assortments, supply chain and information technology. The integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years. The integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015 and our focus has shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems beginning in 2016. Due to the size of the acquisition, we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business. Therefore, we believe providing additional information in the form of non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is completed. 
    
  Store Closure Consolidation Expenses   - Store closure and consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with the our announced plans to (i) convert and consolidate the Carquest stores acquired from GPI, (ii) close our Autopart International stores in Florida and (iii) close approximately 80 underperforming Advance Auto Parts stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The conversion and consolidation of the Carquest stores is a multi-year process that began in 2014. As of October 8, 2016, 316 Carquest stores acquired from GPI had been consolidated into existing Advance Auto Parts stores and 266 stores had been converted to the Advance Auto Parts format. As of October 8, 2016, we operated 640 stores under the Carquest name. The closure of the 40 Autopart International stores in Florida, primarily in the first quarter of 2015, and closure of 80 underperforming Advance Auto Parts stores in the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly exceeded our average historical store closure activity. While periodic store closures are common, these closures represent major programs outside of our typical market evaluation process. We also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our non-GAAP measures. We believe it is useful to provide additional non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance. 
    
  Support Center Restructuring Expenses   - The costs excluded for support center restructuring activities include costs associated with (i) closing our Minnesota office and relocating functions to existing offices, (ii) relocating functions within our Roanoke, VA office and Raleigh, NC office (formerly the headquarters for GPI) and (iii) eliminating duplicative functions between these two offices. These actions are a direct consequence of the acquisition and integration of GPI and therefore we do not consider these expenses to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business. These actions were substantially completed as of the end of fiscal 2015 and we have had no material store support center restructuring expenses following the end of fiscal 2015. 
    
  We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following tables.

    The income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the estimated tax rate in effect for the respective non-GAAP adjustments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits, the purchase of inventory, contractual obligations, capital expenditures, the payment of income taxes and funding of our strategic business plan. In addition, we may use available funds for acquisitions, to repay borrowings under our credit agreement, to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends. Historically, we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed. We believe funds generated from our expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year. Cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict the liquidity needs for our domestic operations. 
    
  At   October 8, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents balance was   $119.5 million  , an increase of   $28.7 million   compared to   January 2, 2016  . This increase in cash during the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   was primarily a result of cash generated by operating activities, net of capital expenditures and net repayments on our credit facilities. Additional discussion of our cash flow results, including the comparison of the activity for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   to the comparable period of Fiscal   2015  , is set forth in the   Analysis of Cash Flows   section. 
    
  As of   October 8, 2016  , our outstanding indebtedness was   $1,043.0 million   consisting primarily of our senior unsecured notes. This is   $163.9 million   lower when compared to   January 2, 2016  , as a result of net repayments on our credit facility. As of   October 8, 2016  , we had   no   borrowings outstanding under our term loan or revolving credit facility. We had   $100.7 million   in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to   $899.3 million   as of   October 8, 2016  .  
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  Our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development (leased and owned locations), maintenance of existing stores, investments in supply chain and information technology and GPI integration expenditures. We lease approximately   84%   of our stores. Our capital expenditures were   $204.2   million for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  . 
    
  Our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores, information technology, supply chain network and the integration of GPI. In fiscal   2016  , we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately   $275.0 million   but may vary with business conditions. These investments will primarily include GPI integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities; new store development (leased and owned locations); and investments in our existing stores, supply chain network and systems. During the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , we opened   48   stores and   five   Worldpac branches compared to   73   stores and   seven   branches during the comparable period of last year. We anticipate opening between   65 to 75   stores and Worldpac branches during Fiscal   2016  .  
    
  Stock Repurchases 
    
  Our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. Our   $500 million   stock repurchase program in place as of   October 8, 2016   was authorized by our Board of Directors on May 14, 2012. During the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , we repurchased   no   shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. At   October 8, 2016  , we had   $415.1 million   remaining under our stock repurchase program.  
    
  Dividend 
    
  Since Fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends of   $0.06   per share to stockholders of record. On   November 8, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.06   per share to be paid on   January 6, 2017   to all common stockholders of record as of   December 23, 2016  .

Analysis of Cash Flows 
    
  A summary and analysis of our cash flows for the   forty   week period ended   October 8, 2016   as compared to the   forty   week period ended   October 10, 2015   is included below. 

Operating Activities 
    
  For the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities decreased by   $110.7 million   to   $409.4 million   compared to the comparable period of   2015  . The net decrease in operating cash flow compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in working capital and a decrease in net income. The decrease in cash flows from working capital was primarily driven by an increase in inventory, net of accounts payable. Our inventory growth was driven mainly by the build-up of transitional inventory associated with our Carquest products and store integration, the opening of new locations, including a new Worldpac distribution center, and lower than expected sales during the period. In addition, our ratio of accounts payable to inventory has decreased primarily related to the timing of the increase in inventory which occurred early in 2016. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  For the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities increased by   $25.5 million   to   $205.4 million   compared to the comparable period of   2015  . Cash used in investing activities for the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment, which is   $43.0 million   higher than the prior year primarily as a result of increased investments in supply chain and existing stores.  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  For the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $176.3 million  , as compared to   $337.3 million   for the   forty   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  , a decrease of   $161.0 million  . This decrease was primarily a result of net repayments under our credit facility during the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016   of   $160.0 million   compared to net repayments of   $343.4 million   during the   forty   weeks ended   October 10, 2015  . As of   October 8, 2016  , we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility. We remain focused on maintaining our leverage ratio and our investment grade ratings, while making investments in our business and deploying our capital allocation strategy that includes our share repurchase program and dividends. 

Long-Term Debt 
    
  Bank Debt 
    
  We have a credit agreement (the "2013 Credit Agreement") which provides a   $1.0 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility with Advance Stores Company, Inc. ("Advance Stores"), as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub-limit of   $300.0 million   and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed   $50.0 million  . We may request, subject to agreement by one or more lenders, that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed   $250.0 million   by those respective lenders (up to a total commitment of   $1.25 billion  ) during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part, at our option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the revolving credit facility terminates in December 2018.  The 2013 Credit Agreement previously included a term loan that was repaid in full as of   October 8, 2016  . 

36 

     Table of Contents  

As of   October 8, 2016  , under the 2013 Credit Agreement, we had   no   outstanding borrowings under the revolver. As of   October 8, 2016  , we had letters of credit outstanding of   $100.7 million  , which reduced the availability under the revolver to   $899.3 million  . The letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our self-insurance policies.  
    
  The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based, at our option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin as of   October 8, 2016   was   1.10%   and   0.10%   per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. A facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility, payable in arrears. The current facility fee rate as of   October 8, 2016   was   0.15%   per annum. Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the interest rate and facility fee are subject to change based on our credit rating. 
    
  The 2013 Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, which include a maximum leverage ratio and minimum consolidated coverage ratio, and are further described in Note 6,   Long-term Debt  , in this Form 10-Q. We were in compliance with our covenants with respect to the 2013 Credit Agreement at   October 8, 2016  .  
    
  As of   October 8, 2016  , we had a credit rating from Standard   Poor s of BBB- and from Moody s Investor Service of Baa2. The current outlooks by Standard   Poor s and Moody s are both stable. The current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on our credit ratings. Therefore, if these credit ratings decline, our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited. In addition, it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program, where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions, which could result in increased working capital requirements. Conversely, if these credit ratings improve, our interest rate may decrease. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
    
  At   October 8, 2016   our outstanding senior unsecured notes consisted of i)   $450 million   of   4.50%   notes maturing in December 2023 (the  2023 Notes  ii)   $300 million   of   4.50%   notes maturing in January 2022 (the  2022 Notes  and iii)   $300 million   of   5.75%   notes maturing in May 2020 (the  2020 Notes  or collectively with the 2023 Notes and 2022 Notes,  the Notes ). The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of   4.50%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of   4.50%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of   5.75%   per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. 
    
  Advance served as the issuer of the Notes with certain of Advance's domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors. The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the  Indenture ) among us, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. The terms of the Indenture are further described in Note 6,   Long-term Debt  , in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling   $27.3 million   as of   October 8, 2016  . These loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers. We believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal. As of   October 8, 2016  , we had no other off-balance-sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303 of the SEC regulations. We include other off-balance-sheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table in our   2015   Form 10-K, including operating lease payments, interest payments on our Notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  As of   October 8, 2016  , there were no material changes to our outstanding contractual obligations as compared to our contractual obligations outstanding as of   January 2, 2016  . For additional information regarding our contractual obligations see  Contractual Obligations  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months.  
  In addition, our business can be affected significantly by weather conditions. While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods, extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by

causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate. Our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending trade-offs typically influence our Professional and DIY sales.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Interest Rate Risk  
    
  Our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates. Historically, we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements. We have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. Our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. We had no derivative instruments outstanding as of   October 8, 2016  .  
    
  The interest rates on borrowings under our 2013 Credit Agreement is based, at our option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. As of   October 8, 2016   we had   no   borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan. However, if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility, we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in LIBOR or alternate base rate. There is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020, 2022 or 2023 Notes, as the interest rates are fixed at   5.75%  ,   4.50%   and   4.50%  , respectively, per annum. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  Our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables. We are exposed to normal credit risk from customers. Our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances, which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base. We strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength. We have not historically had significant credit losses. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  Our primary foreign currency exposure arises from our Canadian operations and the translation of Canadian dollar denominated revenues, profits and net assets into U.S. dollars. During the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  , the translation of the operating results of our Canadian subsidiaries did not significantly impact net income. We view our investments in the Canadian subsidiaries as long-term, and any changes in our net assets in the Canadian subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless the Canadian subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed.  
    
  In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of the Company's inventory purchases which are denominated in foreign currencies and for intercompany balances. We believe that the price volatility of these inventory purchases as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices. Losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in Other (expense) income, net, were   $1.2 million   during the   forty   weeks ended   October 8, 2016  .

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   October 8, 2016   in accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   October 8, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Company shall pay to the Executive a cash bonus in the amount of $380,000 less applicable taxes (the  Signing Bonus ), which will be included in the Executive s first paycheck following the Commencement Date; provided, that the Executive shall repay to the Company one-hundred percent (100%) of the Signing Bonus if the Executive voluntarily resigns from the Company without Good Reason (as defined below) prior to the first anniversary of the Commencement Date.  In the event Executive is required to repay the Signing Bonus pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i), Executive explicitly authorizes the Company at its option, and to the extent permitted by applicable federal and state law, to deduct the repayment of the Signing Bonus from any monies owed to Executive (including, but not limited to, salary and bonuses) from any pending/final paycheck(s) due to Executive.  If Executive s final paycheck(s) does/do not fully offset the amount due to the Company, Executive shall repay the remaining balance of the Signing Bonus in full within sixty (60) days of Executive s termination of employment and shall pay interest (at the maximum legal rate authorized by law) after the balance has been due for sixty (60) days until paid in full and any reasonable collection costs incurred by the Company in pursuit of the repayment of the Signing Bonus, including attorneys  fees and court costs. 
    
  (ii)        Sign-on Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)  .

The Sign-On RSUs shall be issued under the 2014 LTIP and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2014 LTIP and the award agreements evidencing the grant of such Sign-On RSUs. 
  
   3 

(e)        Incentive Compensation Clawback  .

  (f)        Benefit Plans  .    During the Employment Term, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all retirement and employment benefit plans and programs of the Company that are generally available to senior executives of the Company, including relocation benefits as agreed between the parties.  Such participation shall be pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans and programs, as the same shall be amended from time to time.  The Executive shall be entitled to four (4) weeks paid vacation annually.   
    (g)        Business Expenses  .    During the Employment Term, the Company shall, in accordance with policies then in effect with respect to payments of business expenses, pay or reimburse the Executive for all reasonable out-of-pocket travel and other expenses (other than ordinary commuting expenses) incurred by the Executive in performing services hereunder; provided, however, that, with respect to reimbursements, if any, not otherwise excludible from the Executive s gross income, to the extent required to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), no reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive during any taxable year shall be made after the last day of the following taxable year, and the right to reimbursement of such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  All such expenses shall be accounted for in such reasonable detail as the Company may require. 
    
           4. 
    Termination of Employment  . 
       
  (a)        Death  .    In the event of the death of the Executive during the Employment Term, the Executive s employment shall be automatically terminated as of the date of death and a lump sum amount, equivalent to the Executive s annual Base Salary and Target Bonus then in effect, shall be paid, within 60 days after the date of the Executive s death, to the Executive s designated beneficiary, or to the Executive s estate or other legal representative if no beneficiary was designated at the time of the Executive s death.  In the event of the death of the Executive during the Employment Term, the restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any Option, Stock Appreciation Right ( SAR ), Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Deferred Stock Unit, Dividend Equivalent or any Stock Grant Awards (collectively  Awards ), as such Awards are defined in the 2014 LTIP (or any applicable successor or predecessor plan of the Company), granted to the Executive shall be subject to the provisions regarding vesting and transferability in those circumstances as are set forth in the applicable award agreement or grant.  The foregoing benefit will be provided in addition to any death, disability or other benefits provided under the Company s benefit plans and programs in which the Executive was participating at the time of his death.      Except in accordance with the terms of the Company s benefit programs and other plans and programs then in effect, after the date of the Executive s death, the Executive shall not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits from the Company or hereunder. 
  
   4 

(b)        Disability  .    In the event of the Executive s Disability as hereinafter defined, the employment of the Executive may be terminated by the Company, effective upon the Disability Termination Date (as defined below).  In such event, the Company shall pay the Executive an amount equivalent to thirty percent (30%) of the Executive s Base Salary for a one year period, which amount shall be paid in one lump sum within 45 days following the Executive s  separation from service,  as that term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, from the Company (his  Separation From Service ), provided that the Executive or an individual duly authorized to execute legal documents on the Executive s behalf executes and does not revoke within any applicable revocation period the release described in Section 4(k)(ii)(B).  The foregoing benefit will be provided in addition to any disability or other benefits provided under the Company s benefit plans in which the Executive participates.  For the avoidance of doubt, participation by the Executive in the Company s long-term and/or short-term disability insurance benefit plans is voluntary on the part of the Executive and is made available by the Company at the sole cost of the Executive.  The purpose and intent of the preceding three sentences is to ensure that the Executive receives a combination of insurance benefits and Company payments following the Disability Termination Date equal to 100% of his then-applicable Base Salary for such one-year period.  In the event that Executive does not elect to participate in the Company s long-term and/or short-term disability insurance benefit plans, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the Executive any amount in excess of thirty percent (30%) of the Executive s Base Salary.  In the event of the Disability of the Executive during the Employment Term, the restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any Option, SAR, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, Deferred Stock Unit, Dividend Equivalent or any Stock Grant Awards (collectively  Awards ), as such Awards are defined in the 2014 LTIP (or any applicable successor or predecessor plan of the Company), granted to the Executive shall be subject to the provisions regarding vesting and transferability in those circumstances as are set forth in the applicable award agreement or grant.  The Company shall also pay to the Executive a lump sum amount equivalent to the Executive s Target Bonus Amount then in effect, which amount shall be paid in one lump sum within 45 days following the Executive s Separation from Service, provided that the Executive or an individual duly authorized to execute legal documents on the Executive s behalf executes and does not revoke within any applicable revocation period the release described in Section 4(j)(ii)(B).  Otherwise, after the Disability Termination Date, except in accordance with the Company s benefit programs and other plans then in effect, the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation or benefits from the Company or hereunder. 
    
   Disability,  for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean the Executive s incapacity due to physical or mental illness causing the Executive s complete and full-time absence from the Executive s duties, as defined in Paragraph 2, for either a consecutive period of more than six months or at least 180 days within any 270-day period.   
    
  (c)        Termination by the Company for Due Cause  .    Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from terminating the Executive s employment at any time for  Due Cause  (as hereinafter defined).  The Executive shall continue to receive the Base Salary provided for in this Agreement only through the period ending with the date of such termination.  Any rights and benefits the Executive may have under employee benefit plans and programs of the Company shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs.  Except as provided in the two immediately preceding sentences, after termination of employment for Due Cause, the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation or benefits from the Company or hereunder.   

5 

For purposes of this Agreement,  Due Cause  shall mean:  
    
  (i)          a material breach by the Executive of the Executive s duties and obligations under this Agreement or violation in any material respect of any code or standard of conduct generally applicable to the officers of the Company, including, but not limited to, the Company s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which, if curable, has not been cured by the Executive within 15 business days after the Executive s receipt of notice to the Executive specifying the nature of such breach or violations;  
    
  (ii)         a material violation by the Executive of the Executive s Loyalty Obligations as provided in Paragraph 18;  
    
  (iii)         the commission by the Executive or indictment for     a crime of moral turpitude or a felony involving fraud, breach of trust, or misappropriation;  
    
  (iv)         the Executive s willfully engaging in bad faith conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; or 
  (v)         a determination by the Company that the Executive is in violation of the Company s Substance Abuse Policy.  
    
    (d)        Termination by the Company Other than for Due Cause, Death or Disability  .    The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company may terminate the Executive s employment for any or no reason, as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion and judgment;   provided  ,   however  , that in the event such termination is not due to Death, Disability or Due Cause, the Executive shall (i) be entitled to a Termination Payment as hereinafter defined and (ii) be sent written notice stating the termination is not due to Death, Disability or Due Cause.  In the event of such termination by the Company, the Executive shall receive certain payments and benefits as set forth in this Subsection 4(d).  
    
    (i)          Termination Payment  .    If the Company terminates the Executive s employment for other than Death, Disability or Due Cause prior to the expiration of the Employment Term, the term  Termination Payment  shall mean a cash payment equal to the sum of: 
    
           (A)         an amount equal to the Executive s annual Base Salary, as in effect immediately prior to such termination (unless the termination is in connection with an action that would have enabled the Executive to terminate his employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4(e)(i)(A), in which case, it shall be the Base Salary in effect prior to any such material diminution of the Base Salary) (the  Termination Salary Payment ), and 
  
   6 

(B)        an amount equal to the average value of the annual bonuses pursuant to Section 3(b)     paid to Executive for the three completed fiscal years immediately prior to the date of such termination; provided, however, that if Executive has been employed by the Company for fewer than three complete fiscal years prior to the date of such termination, Executive shall receive an amount equal to the average value of the annual bonuses pursuant to Section 3(b) that the Executive has received during the period of the Executive s employment.  
    (ii)          Outplacement Services  .    The Company shall make outplacement services available to the Executive, at a cost to the Company not to exceed $12,000, for a period of time not to exceed 12 months following the date of termination pursuant to the Company s Executive outplacement program with the Company s selected vendor, to include consulting, search support and administrative services.    
    
    (iii)          Medical Coverage  .    In addition, the Company shall provide the Executive with medical, dental and vision insurance benefits (which may also cover, if applicable, the Executive s spouse and eligible dependents) for three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of the Executive s termination of employment or until such time as the Executive is eligible for group health coverage under another employer s plan, whichever occurs first.  In order to trigger the Company s obligation to provide health care continuation benefits, the Executive must elect continuation coverage pursuant to the Consolidation Omnibus Budget Act of 1985, as amended ( COBRA ), upon such eligibility.  The Company s obligation shall be satisfied solely through the payment of the Executive s COBRA premiums during the 365-day period, but only to the extent that such premiums exceed the amount that would otherwise have been payable by the Executive for coverage of the Executive and the Executive s eligible dependents that were covered by the Company s medical, dental, and vision insurance programs at the time of the Executive s termination of employment had the Executive continued to be employed by the Company.    
    
    (iv)          Other  .    If the Company terminates the Executive s employment for other than Death, Disability or Due Cause, the Sign-On RSUs shall become fully vested as of the Executive s date of termination; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sign-On RSUs will cease vesting as of the Executive s date of termination as the result of the Executive s resignation from employment by the Company for Good Reason as defined in Section 4(e) of this Agreement.  Any long-term incentive awards granted to the Executive pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof shall be treated in the manner set forth in the 2014 LTIP and the applicable award agreements.   
    
    (v)        Timing of Payments  .    The Termination Salary Payment and Termination Bonus Payment shall be paid in one lump sum within 45 days following the date of the Executive s Separation From Service, provided that the Executive executes and does not revoke within any applicable revocation period the release described in Section 4(j)(ii)(B) below.   
  
   7 

(vi)          Entire Obligation  .    Except as provided in Subsection 4(j) of this Agreement, following the Executive s termination of employment under this Subsection 4(d), the Executive will have no further obligation to the Company pursuant to this Agreement (other than under Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 19, 20 (to the extent such policies, guidelines and codes by their terms apply post-employment) and 21).  Except for the Termination Payment and as otherwise provided in accordance with the terms of the Company s benefit programs and plans then in effect or as expressly required under applicable law, after termination by the Company of employment for other than Death, Disability or Due Cause, the Executive shall not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits from the Company or hereunder. 
    
    (e)        Resignation from Employment by the Company for Good Reason  .    Termination by the Company without Due Cause under Subsection 4(d) shall be deemed to have occurred if the Executive elects to terminate the Executive s employment for Good Reason.   
    
    (i)          Good Reason.        For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  shall mean:   
    
    (A)         a material diminution in the Executive s  Total Direct Compensation,  which shall mean the value of the total of the Executive s Base Salary, Target Bonus opportunity, and annual equity award taken together; 
    
    (B) a material diminution in the Executive s authority, duties, or responsibilities; 
    
    (C)         the Company s requiring the Executive to be based more than 60 miles from the Company s office in Raleigh, North Carolina at which the Executive was principally employed immediately prior to the date of the relocation;  
    
    (D)        delivery by the Company of a notice of a Non-Renewal; or 
    
    (E)  any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the terms of this Agreement.     
    
  (ii)        Notice of Good Reason Condition.      In order to be considered a resignation for Good Reason for purposes of this Agreement, the Executive must provide the Company with written notice and description of the existence of the Good Reason condition within 60 days of the initial discovery by the Executive of the existence of said Good Reason condition and the Company shall have 30 business days to cure such Good Reason condition. 
  (iii)        Effective Date of Resignation.      The effective date of the Executive s resignation for Good Reason must occur no longer than six (6) months following the expiration of the cure period set forth in Section 4(e)(ii), above.  If Executive has not resigned for Good Reason effective within six (6) months following the expiration of the cure period set forth in Section 4(e)(ii), above the Executive shall be deemed to have waived said Good Reason condition. 
  
   8 

(f)        Termination by the Company Other Than For Due Cause, Death or Disability or Resignation from Employment for Good Reason Within Twelve Months After a Change in Control  .  If the Company terminates the Executive s employment for other than Death, Disability or Due Cause prior to the expiration of the Employment Term and within twelve (12) months after a Change In Control (as defined below), or if the Executive elects to terminate the Executive s employment for Good Reason prior to the expiration of the Employment Term and within twelve (12) months after a Change In Control, then (i) the Executive shall be entitled to a Change In Control Termination Payment as hereinafter defined in lieu of the Termination Payment set forth in Subsection 4(d)(i) above, (ii) the Executive shall receive benefits as defined in Subsections 4(d)(ii) and (iii) above, and (iii) either the Company or the Executive, as the case may be, shall provide Notice of Termination pursuant to Subsection 4(j)(i) other than in the case of a Non-Renewal, which shall be communicated in accordance with Section 1. 
  (i)  Change In Control Termination Payment  .  The term  Change In Control Termination Payment  shall mean a cash payment equal to the sum of: 
  (A)  an amount equal to two times the Executive s annual Base Salary, as in effect immediately prior to such termination (unless the termination is due to Section 4(e)(i)(A), in which case, it shall be two times the Executive s annual Base Salary in effect prior to any such material diminution of the Base Salary) (the  Change In Control Termination Salary Payment ), and 
    
  (B)  an amount equal to two times the Executive s Target Bonus Amount, as in effect immediately prior to such termination (unless the termination is due to Sections 4(e)(i)(A) or (E), in which case, it shall be two times the Executive s Target Bonus in effect prior to any such material diminution of the Target Bonus or termination of the bonus plan, respectively) (the  Change In Control Termination Bonus Payment ).  
    
  (ii)  Timing of Payments  .    The Change In Control Termination Salary Payment and the Change In Control Termination Bonus Payment shall be paid in lump sum payments within 45 days following the date of the Executive s Separation From Service, provided that the Executive executes and does not revoke within any applicable revocation period the release described in Section 4(j)(ii) below. 
    
  (iii)        Entire Obligation  .    Except as provided in Subsection 4(i) of this Agreement, following the Executive s termination of employment under this Subsection 4(f), the Executive will have no further obligation to the Company pursuant to this Agreement (other than under Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 19, 20 (to the extent such policies, guidelines and codes by their terms apply post-employment) and 21).  Except for the Change In Control Termination Payment and as otherwise provided in accordance with the terms of the Company s benefit programs and plans then in effect or as expressly required under applicable law, within twelve (12) months after a Change In Control, after termination by the Company of employment for other than Death, Disability or Due Cause or after termination by the Executive for Good Reason, the Executive shall not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits from the Company or hereunder. 
  
   9 

(iii)  Change In     Control  .  For purposes of this Agreement,  Change In Control  shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: 
    
  (A) a Transaction, as defined below, unless securities possessing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the survivor s or acquiror s outstanding securities (or the securities of any parent thereof) are held by a person or persons who held securities possessing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the Company s outstanding securities immediately prior to that transaction, or 
    
  (B) any person or group of persons (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and in effect from time to time) directly or indirectly acquires, including but not limited to by means of a merger or consolidation, beneficial ownership (determined pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the said Exchange Act) of securities possessing more than 25% of the total combined voting power of the Company s outstanding securities unless pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made directly to the Company s stockholders that the Board recommends such stockholders accept, other than (i) the Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii) an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iii) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or (iv) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or 
    
  (C) over a period of thirty-six (36) consecutive months or less, there is a change in the composition of the Board such that a majority of the Board members (rounded up to the next whole number, if a fraction) ceases, by reason of one or more proxy contests for the election of Board members, to be composed of individuals who either (i) have been Board members continuously since the beginning of that period, or (ii) have been elected or nominated for election as Board members during such period by at least a majority of the Board members described in the preceding clause (i) who were still in office at the time that election or nomination was approved by the Board. 
    
  For purposes of Section 4(f)(iv)(A),  Transaction  means (1) consummation of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity as a result of which the Stock of the Company is converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property or is cancelled, (2) any sale or exchange of all of the Stock of the Company for cash, securities or other property, (3) any sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets to one or more other persons in a single transaction or series of related transactions or (4) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.  
  
   10 

(v)         IRC 280G  Net-Best   .  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (A) any payment, award, benefit or distribution (or any acceleration of any payment, award, benefit or distribution) by the Company (or any of its affiliated entities) or any entity which effectuates a Change in Control (or any of its affiliated entities) to or for the benefit of Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (the  Payments ) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Excise Tax ), and (B) the reduction of the amounts payable to Executive to the maximum amount that could be paid to Executive without giving rise to the Excise Tax (the  Safe Harbor Cap ) would provide Executive with a greater after tax amount than if such amounts were not reduced, then the amounts payable to Executive shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Cap.  If the reduction of the amounts payable would not result in a greater after tax result to Executive, no amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this provision. 
              (A)         Reduction of Payments.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing first cash amounts payable under this Agreement (in contrast to benefit amounts), and applying any reduction to amounts payable in the following order: (A) first, any cash amounts payable to Executive as a Termination Payment or Change in Control Termination Payment under this Agreement, as applicable; (B) second, any cash amounts payable by Company for Outplacement Services on behalf of Executive under the terms of this Agreement; (C) third, any amounts payable by Company on behalf of Executive under the terms of this Agreement for continued Medical Coverage; (D) fourth, any other cash amounts payable by Company to or on behalf of Executive under the terms of this Agreement: (E) fifth, outstanding performance-based equity grants to the extent that any such grants would be subject to the Excise Tax; and (F) finally, any time-vesting equity grants to the extent that any such grants would be subject to the Excise Tax.  
              (B)        Determinations by Accounting Firm.  All determinations required to be made under this Section 4(f)(v) shall be made by the public accounting firm that is retained by the Company as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the  Accounting Firm ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Company or Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (A) the Board shall determine prior to the Change in Control that the Accounting Firm is precluded from performing such services under applicable auditor independence rules or (B) the Audit Committee of the Board determines that it does not want the Accounting Firm to perform such services because of auditor independence concerns or (C) the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the person(s) effecting the Change in Control, the Board shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Executive to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the costs of retaining experts) of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.  If Payments are reduced to the Safe Harbor Cap or the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive without a reduction in Payments, the Accounting Firm shall provide a written opinion to Executive to the effect that the Executive is not required to report any Excise Tax on the Executive s federal income tax return, and that the failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on Executive s applicable federal income tax return will not result in the  
  
   11 

imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive (except as provided in paragraph 4(f)(v)(C) below). 
                (C)       Excess Payment/Underpayment.  If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ) proceeding which has been finally and conclusively resolved, that Payments have been made to, or provided for the benefit of, Executive, which are in excess of the limitations provided in this Section (referred to hereinafter as an  Excess Payment ), Executive shall repay the Excess Payment to the Company on demand, together with interest on the Excess Payment at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of Executive s receipt of such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the determination, it is possible that Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an  Underpayment ), consistent with the calculations required to be made under this Section.  In the event that it is determined (i) by the Accounting Firm, the Company (which shall include the position taken by the Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its federal income tax return) or the IRS or (ii) pursuant to a determination by a court, that an Underpayment has occurred, the Company shall pay an amount equal to such Underpayment to Executive within ten (10) days of such determination together with interest on such amount at the applicable federal rate from the date such amount would have been paid to Executive until the date of payment.  Executive shall cooperate, to the extent the Executive s reasonable expenses are reimbursed by the Company, with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with any contests or disputes with the IRS in connection with the Excise Tax or the determination of the Excess Payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that amounts payable under this Agreement were reduced pursuant to paragraph 4(f)(v)(A) and the value of stock options is subsequently re-determined by the Accounting Firm within the context of Treasury Regulation  1.280G-1 Q/A 33 that reduces the value of the Payments attributable to such options, the Company shall promptly pay to Executive any amounts payable under this Agreement that were not previously paid solely as a result of paragraph 4(f)(v)(A) up to the Safe Harbor Cap. 
  
   12 

(g)        Voluntary Termination Without Good Reason  .    In the event that the Executive terminates the Executive s employment at the Executive s own volition prior to the expiration of the Employment Term (except as provided in Subsection 4(e) above), such termination shall constitute a  Voluntary Termination  and in such event the Executive shall be limited to the same rights and benefits as provided in connection with a termination for Due Cause under Subsection 4(c) above.  
  (h)        Compliance With Code Section 409A  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement is intended to be interpreted and operated so that the payment of the benefits set forth herein either shall either be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or shall comply with the requirements of such provision; provided however that in no event shall the Company be liable to the Executive for or with respect to any taxes, penalties or interest which may be imposed upon the Executive pursuant to Section 409A.  To the extent that any amount payable pursuant to Subsections 4(b), (d)(i), (d)(iii) or (f) constitutes a  deferral of compensation  subject to Section 409A (a  409A Payment ), then, if on the date of the Executive s  separation from service,  as such term is defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), from the Company (his  Separation from Service ), the Executive is a  specified employee,  as such term is defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409-1(i), as determined from time to time by the Company, then such 409A Payment shall not be made to the Executive earlier than the earlier of (i) six (6) months after the Executive s Separation from Service; or (ii) the date of his death.  The 409A Payments under this Agreement that would otherwise be made during such period shall be aggregated and paid in one lump sum, without interest, on the first business day following the end of the six (6) month period or following the date of the Executive s death, whichever is earlier, and the balance of the 409A Payments, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the applicable payment schedule provided in this Section 4.  To the extent any 409A Payment is conditioned on the Executive (or his legal representative) executing a release of claims, which 409A Payment would be made in a later taxable year of the Executive than the taxable year in which his Separation from Service occurs if such release were executed and delivered and became irrevocable at the last possible date allowed under this Agreement, such 409A Payment will be paid no earlier than such later taxable year.

Such injunction shall be available without the posting of any bond or other security, and the Executive hereby consents to the issuance of such injunction.   
    
    (j)        Re-Set of Period for Non-Competition and Non-Interference  .

              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s)and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
