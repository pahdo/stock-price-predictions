      Notes to September 30, 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
       1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation       Arthur J. Gallagher   Co. and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as we, our, us or the company, provide insurance brokerage and risk management services to a wide variety of commercial,
industrial, institutional and governmental organizations through three reportable segments. Commission and fee revenue generated by the brokerage segment is primarily related to the negotiation and placement of insurance for our
clients. Fee revenue generated by the risk management segment is primarily related to claims management, information management, risk control consulting (loss control) services and appraisals in the property/casualty market. Investment
income and other revenue are generated from our premium financing operations and our investment portfolio, which includes invested cash and restricted funds, as well as clean energy and other investments. We are headquartered in Itasca,
Illinois, have operations in 33 countries and offer client-service capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants.   
  We have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein are, in the
opinion of management, prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as disclosed in Note 2, and include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the information set forth. The quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be reported for subsequent quarters or the full year. These unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the preparation of our unaudited
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016, management evaluated all material subsequent events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date on which the financial statements were issued, for
potential recognition or disclosure therein.       2. Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements    
   Cash Receipts and Cash Payments       In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which we refer to as the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (which we refer to as ASU) No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging
Issues Task Force), (ASU 2016-15). The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU
2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently
reviewing the new guidance, and the impact from its adoption on our consolidated financial statements cannot be determined at this time.   
   Leases       In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under this new accounting guidance, an entity is required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing
arrangements. This new guidance offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing
arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This new guidance is effective for first quarter 2019, and requires a modified retrospective adoption,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing the new guidance, and the impact from its adoption on our consolidated financial statements cannot be determined at this time.       Stock Compensation       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This new accounting guidance requires that all companies recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, rather than maintaining an APIC pool
and recognizing the tax benefits in excess of compensation costs through equity. As it relates to forfeitures, the guidance allows for companies to choose whether to continue to estimate forfeitures or account for forfeitures as they
occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the new guidance may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective
basis. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   
         - 8 -

Table of Contents  

    Consolidations       In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. This new accounting guidance on consolidations eliminates the deferral granted to investment
companies from applying the variable interest entities guidance and makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance. The new guidance applies to all entities involved with limited partnerships or similar entities and required
re-evaluation of these entities under the revised guidance, which could have changed previous consolidation conclusions. The new guidance was effective in first quarter 2016 and has been applied by us. The adoption of this guidance did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       Debt Issuance Costs    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new accounting guidance requires debt issuance
costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The new guidance was effective in first quarter 2016 and has been applied by us on a retrospective basis. Accordingly, we have reclassified debt
issuance costs of $3.3 million previously included in Other  non-current  assets to Corporate related borrowings   noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.   
   Intangibles   Goodwill and Other    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This new guidance provides additional information to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as
internal-use software or as a service contract. The new guidance was effective in first quarter 2016 and has been applied by us. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
      Business Combinations       In
September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The new accounting guidance requires that measurement period adjustments be recognized
in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined rather than retrospectively applying the change to the acquisition date. The new guidance was effective in first quarter 2016 and was applied by us. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       Income Taxes    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The new
accounting guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and noncurrent components. ASU 2015-17 is effective in first quarter
2017. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 during first quarter 2016 on a retrospective
basis. Accordingly, we reclassified the current deferred taxes to noncurrent in our December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet, which increased Noncurrent deferred tax assets by $122.1 million and increased Other noncurrent
liabilities by $4.6 million.       Revenue Recognition       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Topic, ASC 606, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S.
GAAP. The core principal of the new accounting guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in
judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. Reporting entities may choose to adopt the
standard as of the original effective date. The FASB decided, based on its outreach to various stakeholders and the forthcoming amendments to the new revenue standard, that a deferral was necessary to provide adequate time to effectively
implement the new revenue standard. This new guidance was originally effective for the first quarter 2017 and early adoption was not permitted. With the one year deferral date, this new guidance is now effective for the first quarter 2018,
but it can be adopted earlier in first quarter 2017. We plan to adopt this new guidance in first quarter 2018. The guidance permits two methods of transition upon adoption; full retrospective and modified retrospective. Under the full
retrospective method, prior periods would be restated under the new revenue standard, providing a comparable view across all periods presented. Under the modified retrospective method, prior periods would not be restated.

Rather, revenues and other disclosures for pre-2017 periods would be provided in the notes to the financial statements as previously reported under the current revenue standard. We are
currently reviewing the guidance, and the impact from its adoption on our consolidated financial statements cannot be determined at this time.   
   3. Business Combinations       During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the net assets of the following firms in exchange for our common stock and/or cash. These acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method for
recording business combinations (in millions except share data):       
 
         - 10 -

Effective on September 1, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and an assembled
workforce from one of our India-based outsourced service providers for approximately $4.6 million in cash. Prior to this transaction, most of our India-based workforce was provided by the third-party on a cost-pass-through basis. We now directly
employ those associates thereby adding approximately 2,700 employees to our global workforce.      Common shares issued in connection with
acquisitions are valued at closing market prices as of the effective date of the applicable acquisition. We record escrow deposits that are returned to us as a result of adjustments to net assets acquired as reductions of goodwill when the escrows
are settled. The maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the foregoing table represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition. The
amounts recorded as earnout payables, which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date, are measured at fair value as of the
acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration in the foregoing table. We will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations, including the accretion of discount, in our consolidated
statement of earnings when incurred. The fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the
respective purchase agreements, which is a Level 3 fair value measurement. In determining fair value, we estimated the acquired entity s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market
participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. Revenue growth rates generally ranged from 3.5% to 12.5% for our 2016 acquisitions. We estimated future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets
specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. We then discounted these payments to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired
entity to achieve the targets. These discount rates generally ranged from 8.5% to 9.5% for all of our 2016 acquisitions. Changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions for revenue growth and/or profitability, or the risk-adjusted
discount rate, would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations.

   During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $4.3 million and $3.7
million, respectively, of expense in our consolidated statement of earnings related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, we recognized $12.5 million and $12.2 million, respectively, of expense in our consolidated statement of earnings related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions. In
addition, during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.2 million of income and $6.0 million of expense, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in
connection with revised projections of future performance for 27 and 35 acquisitions, respectively. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $8.7 million and $13.7 million of expense, respectively, related
to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 77 and 72 acquisitions, respectively. The aggregate amount of maximum earnout obligations related to acquisitions
was $503.8 million as of September 30, 2016, of which $225.0 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made.  
  The following is a summary of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired at the date of each acquisition made in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016 (in millions):       
    Among other things, these acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations, further extend our
presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services and risk management industries and increase the volume of general services currently provided. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net
assets acquired at the acquisition date was allocated to goodwill, expiration lists, non-compete agreements and trade names in the amounts of $147.2 million, $131.5 million, $1.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, within the brokerage
segment.   
         - 12 -

   Provisional estimates of fair value are established at the time of each acquisition and are subsequently
reviewed within the first year of operations subsequent to the acquisition date to determine the necessity for adjustments. The fair value of the tangible assets and liabilities for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date approximated
their carrying values. The fair value of expiration lists was established using the excess earnings method, which is an income approach based on estimated financial projections developed by management for each acquired entity using market
participant assumptions. Revenue growth and attrition rates generally ranged from 1.0% to 3.0% and 2.5% to 12.5%, respectively, for our 2015 acquisitions for which valuations were performed in 2016. We estimate the fair value as the present value of
the benefits anticipated from ownership of the subject customer list in excess of returns required on the investment in contributory assets necessary to realize those benefits. The rate used to discount the net benefits was based on a risk-adjusted
rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return and reflects the risk of the asset relative to the acquired business. These discount rates generally ranged from 12.0% to 19.0% for our 2015 acquisitions for which valuations were
performed in 2016. The fair value of non-compete agreements was established using the profit differential method, which is an income approach based on estimated financial projections developed by management for the acquired company using market
participant assumptions and various non-compete scenarios.      Expiration lists, non-compete agreements and trade names related to our
acquisitions are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (three to fifteen years for expiration lists, three to five years for non-compete agreements and three to five years for trade names), while goodwill is not
subject to amortization. We use the straight-line method to amortize these intangible assets because the pattern of their economic benefits cannot be reasonably determined with any certainty. We review all of our intangible assets for impairment
periodically (at least annually) and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. In reviewing intangible assets, if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of
the respective (or underlying) asset, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense.
     Of the $131.5 million of expiration lists, $1.3 million of non-compete agreements and $0.1 million of trade names related to
our acquisitions made during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, $61.1 million, $0.7 million, and $0.1 million, respectively, is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Accordingly, we recorded a
deferred tax liability of $21.1 million, and a corresponding amount of goodwill, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, related to nondeductible amortizable intangible assets.  
  Our consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 include the operations of the acquired entities from their
respective acquisition dates. The following is a summary of the unaudited pro forma historical results, as if these entities had been acquired at January 1, 2015 (in millions, except per share data):   
   
    The unaudited pro forma results above have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be
indicative of the results of operations which actually would have resulted had these acquisitions occurred at January 1, 2015, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. Annualized revenues of entities acquired during the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $97.8 million. For the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016, total revenues and net earnings recorded in our unaudited
consolidated statement of earnings related to our acquisitions made during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 in the aggregate, were $39.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.

    4. Other Current Assets       Major classes of other current assets consist of the following (in millions):       
    The premium finance loans represent short-term loans which we make to many of our brokerage related clients and other  non-brokerage  clients to finance their premiums paid to insurance carriers. These premium finance loans are primarily generated by three Australian and New Zealand premium finance subsidiaries. Financing receivables
are carried at amortized cost. Given that these receivables are collateralized, generally carry a fairly rapid delinquency period of only seven days post payment date, and that contractually the majority of the underlying insurance policies will be
cancelled within one month of the payment due date in normal course, there historically has been a minimal risk of not receiving payment, and therefore we do not maintain any significant allowance for losses against this balance.  
   5. Intangible Assets       The carrying
amount of goodwill at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 allocated by domestic and foreign operations is as follows (in millions):

We are a party to a note purchase agreement dated June 14, 2013, with certain accredited institutional investors, pursuant to which we issued and sold $200.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of our 3.69% Senior Notes, Series G, due June 14, 2022, in a private placement. These notes require semi-annual payments of interest that are due in June and December of each year.   
  We are a party to a note purchase agreement dated December 20, 2013, with certain accredited institutional investors, pursuant to which we issued
and sold $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.58% Senior Notes, Series H, due February 27, 2024, $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.73% Senior Notes, Series I, due February 27, 2026 and
$100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.98% Senior Notes, Series J, due February 27, 2029. These notes require semi-annual payments of interest that are due in February and August of each year. The funding of this note
purchase agreement occurred on February 27, 2014. We incurred approximately $1.4 million of debt acquisition costs that was capitalized and will be amortized on a pro rata basis over the life of the debt.   
  We are a party to a note purchase agreement dated June 24, 2014, with certain accredited institutional investors, pursuant to which we issued and
sold $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.80% Senior Notes, Series K, due June 24, 2018, $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.20% Senior Notes, Series L, due June 24, 2019,
$50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.48% Senior Notes, Series M, due June 24, 2020, $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.13% Senior Notes, Series N, due June 24, 2023,
$200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.31% Senior Notes, Series O, due June 24, 2025 and $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.36% Senior Notes, Series P, due June 24, 2026. These notes
require semi-annual payments of interest that are due in June and December of each year. We incurred approximately $2.6 million of debt acquisition costs that was capitalized and will be amortized on a pro rata basis over the life of the debt.
     We are a party to a note purchase agreement dated June 2, 2016, with certain accredited institutional investors, pursuant to which we
issued and sold $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.40% Senior Notes, Series Q, due June 2, 2026, $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.55% Senior Notes, Series R, due June 2, 2028 and $25.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of our 4.70% Senior Notes, Series S, due June 2, 2031. These notes require semi-annual payments of interest that are due in June and December of each year. We incurred approximately $1.2 million of debt
acquisition costs that was capitalized and will be amortized on a pro rata basis over the life of the debt. In addition, we realized a cash gain of approximately $1.0 million on the hedging transaction that will be recognized on a pro rata
basis as a reduction in our reported interest expense over the ten year life of the debt.     Under the terms of the note purchase agreements
described above, we may redeem the notes at any time, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of such notes being redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and a  make-whole amount.  The  make-whole amount 
is derived from a net present value computation of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest using a discount rate based on U.S. Treasury yields plus 0.5% and is designed to compensate the purchasers of the notes for their
investment risk in the event prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment are less favorable than the interest rates under the notes. We do not currently intend to prepay any of the notes.   
  The note purchase agreements described above contain customary provisions for transactions of this type, including representations and warranties
regarding us and our subsidiaries and various financial covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2016. The note purchase agreements
also provide customary events of default, generally with corresponding grace periods, including, without limitation, payment defaults with respect to the notes, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other agreements evidencing our or our
subsidiaries  indebtedness, certain judgments against us or our subsidiaries and events of bankruptcy involving us or our material subsidiaries.      The notes issued under the note purchase agreements are senior unsecured obligations of ours and rank equal in right of payment with our Credit Agreement discussed below.

    Credit Agreement  - On April 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment and restatement to our
multicurrency credit agreement dated September 19, 2013 (which we refer to as the Credit Agreement) with a group of fifteen financial institutions. The amendment and restatement, among other things, extended the expiration date of the Credit
Agreement from September 19, 2018 to April 8, 2021 and increased the revolving credit commitment from $600.0 million to $800.0 million, of which $75.0 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of
credit and up to $75.0 million may be used for the making of swing loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement). We may from time to time request, subject to certain conditions, an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the Credit
Agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of $1,100.0 million.      The Credit Agreement provides that we may elect
that each borrowing in U.S. dollars be either base rate loans or eurocurrency loans, each as defined in the Credit Agreement. However, the Credit Agreement provides that all loans denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be
eurocurrency loans. Interest rates on base rate loans and outstanding drawings on letters of credit in U.S. dollars under the Credit Agreement will be based on the base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.45%,
depending on the financial leverage ratio we maintain. Interest rates on eurocurrency loans or outstanding drawings on letters of credit in currencies other than U.S. dollars under the Credit Agreement will be based on adjusted LIBOR, as
defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin of 0.85% to 1.45%, depending on the financial leverage ratio we maintain. Interest rates on swing loans will be based, at our election, on either the base rate or an alternate rate that may be quoted by
the lead lender. The annual facility fee related to the Credit Agreement will be between 0.15% and 0.30% of the revolving credit commitment, depending on the financial leverage ratio we maintain. In connection with entering into the Credit
Agreement, we incurred approximately $2.0 million of debt acquisition costs that were capitalized and will be amortized on a pro rata basis over the term of the Credit Agreement.      The terms of the Credit Agreement include various financial covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. We were in compliance with these covenants as of
September 30, 2016. The Credit Agreement also includes customary provisions for transactions of this type, including events of default, with corresponding grace periods and cross-defaults to other agreements evidencing our indebtedness.
     At September 30, 2016, $21.1 million of letters of credit (for which we had $12.0 million of liabilities recorded at
September 30, 2016) were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. There were $258.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016,
$520.9 million remained available for potential borrowings under the Credit Agreement, of which $53.9 million was available for additional letters of credit.      Premium Financing Debt Facility  - On May 18, 2015 we entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement, revolving loan facility, which we refer to as the Premium Financing Debt Facility, that
provides funding for three Australian (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) premium finance subsidiaries. The Premium Financing Debt Facility is comprised of: (i) Facility B, which is separated into AU$150.0 million and NZ$35.0 million tranches, (ii)
Facility C, an AU$25.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche and (iii) Facility D, a NZ$15.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche. The Premium Financing Debt Facility expires May 18, 2017.  
  The interest rates on Facility B are Interbank rates, which vary by tranche, duration and currency, plus a margin of 1.05%. The interest rates on
Facilities C and D are 30 day Interbank rates, plus a margin of 0.55%. The annual fee for Facility B is 0.4725% of the undrawn commitments for the two tranches of the facility. The annual fee for Facilities C and D is 0.50% of the total
commitments of the facilities.     The terms of our Premium Financing Debt Facility include various financial covenants, including covenants that
require us to maintain specified financial ratios. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2016. The Premium Financing Debt Facility also includes customary provisions for transactions of this type, including events of
default, with corresponding grace periods and cross-defaults to other agreements evidencing our indebtedness. Facilities B, C and D are secured by the premium finance receivables of the Australian and New Zealand premium finance subsidiaries.
     At September 30, 2016, AU$149.0 million and NZ$12.5 million of borrowings were outstanding under Facility B, AU zero
borrowings were outstanding under Facility C and NZ$14.9 million of borrowings were outstanding under Facility D. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, AU$1.0 million and NZ$22.5 million remained available for potential
borrowing under Facility B, and AU$25.0 million and NZ$0.1 million under Facilities C and D, respectively.     See Note 13 to
these unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2016.

   The aggregate estimated fair value of the $2,400.0 million in debt under the note purchase agreements
at September 30, 2016 was $2,590.8 million due to the long-term duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations. No active or observable market exists for our private placement long-term debt. Therefore, the estimated
fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 fair value measurement, using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. See Note 1, Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of this debt is based on
the income valuation approach, which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount. The fair value measurement is determined on the basis of
the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. Because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender, the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private
placement long-term debt. The methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance, which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance (the coupon rate) and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield
at that time. The market spread as of the valuation date was calculated, which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today. An implied premium or discount to the par
value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated. The index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the Bloomberg Valuation Services
(BVAL) U.S. Insurers BBB index. This index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate. For the purposes of this analysis, the average BBB rate was assumed to be the appropriate
borrowing rate for us based on our current estimated credit rating. The estimated fair value of the $258.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement approximates their carrying value due to their short-term duration and variable
interest rates. The estimated fair value of the $133.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our Premium Financing Debt Facility approximates their carrying value due to their short-term duration and variable interest rates.  
   7. Earnings Per Share       The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per share (in millions, except per share data):       
    Options to purchase 4.5 million and 3.9 million shares of common stock were outstanding at September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, but were not included in the computation of the dilutive effect of stock options for the  three-month  periods then ended. Options to purchase 5.8 million and 3.4 million shares of
common stock were outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, but were not included in the computation of the dilutive effect of stock options for the  nine-month  periods then ended. These
stock options were excluded from the computation because the options  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares during the respective period, and therefore, would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share
under the treasury stock method.

    8. Stock Option Plans       On May 13, 2014, our stockholders approved the Arthur J. Gallagher 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the LTIP), which replaced our previous stockholder-approved Arthur J. Gallagher
  Co. 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the 2011 LTIP). The LTIP term began May 13, 2014 and terminates on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, unless terminated earlier by our board of directors. All of our
officers, employees and non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the LTIP. The compensation committee of our board of directors determines the participants under the LTIP. The LTIP provides for non-qualified and incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units, any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria. A stock appreciation right entitles the holder to receive,
upon exercise and subject to withholding taxes, cash or shares of our common stock (which may be restricted stock) with a value equal to the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the exercise date and the base price of the
stock appreciation right. Subject to the LTIP limits, the compensation committee has the discretionary authority to determine the size of an award.      Shares of our common stock available for issuance under the LTIP include authorized and unissued shares of common stock or authorized and issued shares of common stock reacquired and held as treasury
shares or otherwise, or a combination thereof. The number of available shares will be reduced by the aggregate number of shares that become subject to outstanding awards granted under the LTIP. To the extent that shares subject to an outstanding
award granted under either the LTIP or the 2011 LTIP are not issued or delivered by reason of the expiration, termination, cancellation or forfeiture of such award or by reason of the settlement of such award in cash, then such shares will again be
available for grant under the LTIP. Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will also be available for grant under the LTIP. Shares that are subject to
a stock appreciation right and were not issued upon the net settlement or net exercise of such stock appreciation right, shares that are used to pay the exercise price of an option, delivered to or withheld by us to pay withholding taxes related to
stock options or stock appreciation rights, and shares that are purchased on the open market with the proceeds of an option exercise, may not again be made available for issuance.      The maximum number of shares available under the LTIP for restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards settled with stock (i.e., all awards other than stock options and stock
appreciation rights) is 1.0 million at September 30, 2016. To the extent necessary to be qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (which we refer to as the IRC): (i) the maximum number of
shares with respect to which options or stock appreciation rights or a combination thereof that may be granted during any fiscal year to any person is 200,000; (ii) the maximum number of shares with respect to which performance-based restricted
stock or restricted stock units that may be granted during any fiscal year to any person is 100,000; (iii) the maximum amount that may be payable with respect to cash-settled performance units granted during any fiscal year to any person is
$5.0 million; and (iv) the maximum number of shares with respect to which stock-settled performance units may be granted during any fiscal year to any person is 100,000.      The LTIP provides for the grant of stock options, which may be either tax-qualified incentive stock options or non-qualified options and stock appreciation rights. The compensation committee determines
the period for the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, tax-qualified incentive stock option or stock appreciation right, provided that no option can be exercised later than seven years after its date of grant. The exercise price of a
non-qualified stock option or tax-qualified incentive stock option and the base price of a stock appreciation right cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, provided that the base price
of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with an option will be the exercise price of the related option.     Upon exercise, the option
exercise price may be paid in cash, by the delivery of previously owned shares of our common stock, through a net-exercise arrangement, or through a broker-assisted cashless exercise arrangement. The compensation committee determines all of the
terms relating to the exercise, cancellation or other disposition of an option or stock appreciation right upon a termination of employment, whether by reason of disability, retirement, death or any other reason. Stock option and stock appreciation
right awards under the LTIP are non-transferable.      On March 17, 2016, the compensation committee granted 2,576,700 options under the 2014
LTIP to our officers and key employees that become exercisable at the rate of 34%, 33% and 33% on the anniversary date of the grant in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. On March 11, 2015, the compensation committee granted 1,941,000 options
under the 2014 LTIP to our officers and key employees that become exercisable at the rate of 34%, 33% and 33% on the anniversary date of the grant in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The 2016 and 2015 options expire seven years from the date of
grant, or earlier in the event of certain terminations of employment. For certain of our executive officers age 55 or older, stock options awarded in 2016 and 2015 are no longer subject to forfeiture upon such officers  departure from the
company after two years from the date of grant.

   Our stock option plans provide for the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock option grants in the event
of a change in control of our company, as defined in the applicable plan documents.      During the three-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we recognized $3.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of compensation expense related to our stock option grants. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $10.9 million
and $8.2 million, respectively, of compensation expense related to our stock option grants.     For purposes of expense recognition, the
estimated fair values of the stock option grants are amortized to expense over the options  vesting period. We estimated the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:       
    Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee and director stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the selective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of our employee and non-employee director stock options. The weighted average fair value per option for all options granted during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as determined on the
grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $8.45 and $9.25, respectively.      The following is a summary of our stock option
activity and related information for 2016 (in millions, except exercise price and year data):       
    Options with respect to 4.4 million shares (less any shares of restricted stock issued under the LTIP - see
Note 10 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements) were available for grant under the LTIP at September 30, 2016.      The
total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $14.9 million and $26.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $45.4 million
of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested options. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately four years.

     9. Deferred Compensation       We have a Deferred Equity Participation Plan (which we refer to as the DEPP), which is a non-qualified plan that generally provides for distributions to certain of our key executives when they reach age
62 (or the one-year anniversary of the date of the grant for participants over the age of 61 as of the grant date) or upon or after their actual retirement. Under the provisions of the DEPP, we typically contribute cash in an amount approved by the
compensation committee to a rabbi trust on behalf of the executives participating in the DEPP, and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on
participant elections. Distributions under the DEPP may not normally be made until the participant reaches age 62 (or the one-year anniversary of the date of the grant for participants over the age of 61 as of the grant date) and are subject to
forfeiture in the event of voluntary termination of employment prior to then. DEPP awards are generally made annually in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2016, we made awards under sub-plans of the DEPP for certain production staff, which
generally provide for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards, although certain awards vest and/or distribute after the earlier of fifteen years or the participant reaching age 65. All contributions to the plan
(including sub-plans) deemed to be invested in shares of our common stock are distributed in the form of our common stock and all other distributions are paid in cash.      Our common stock that is issued to or purchased by the rabbi trust as a contribution under the DEPP is valued at historical cost, which equals its fair market value at the date of grant or date of
purchase. When common stock is issued, we record an unearned deferred compensation obligation as a reduction of capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, which is amortized to compensation expense ratably
over the vesting period of the participants. Future changes in the fair market value of our common stock owed to the participants do not have any impact on the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.  
  In the first quarter of each of 2016 and 2015, the compensation committee approved $10.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of awards in
the aggregate to certain key executives under the DEPP that were contributed to the rabbi trust in first quarter 2016 and 2015, respectively. We contributed cash to the rabbi trust and instructed the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares
of our common stock on the open market to fund these 2016 and 2015 awards. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we charged $2.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these
awards. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we charged $5.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these awards.      In the second quarter of 2016, the compensation committee approved $13.6 million of awards under the sub-plans referred to above, which were contributed to the rabbi trust in second quarter 2016. During
the three-month and  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2016, we charged $0.4 million and $0.8 million to compensation expense related to these awards. There were no distributions from the sub-plans
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded
$49.7 million (related to 2.4 million shares) and $33.5 million (related to 2.1 million shares), respectively, of unearned deferred compensation as a reduction of capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet. The total intrinsic value of our unvested equity based awards under the plan at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $122.7 million and $85.2 million, respectively. During the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016, cash and equity awards with an aggregate fair value of $7.0 million were vested and distributed to executives under the DEPP.

   We have a Deferred Cash Participation Plan (which we refer to as the DCPP), which is a non-qualified
deferred compensation plan for certain key employees, other than executive officers, that generally provides for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards. Under the provisions of the DCPP, we typically
contribute cash in an amount approved by compensation committee to the rabbi trust on behalf of the executives participating in the DCPP, and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock on the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions based on participant elections. In the first quarter of each of 2016 and 2015, the compensation committee approved $3.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of awards in the aggregate to certain key executives
under the DCPP that were contributed to the rabbi trust in first quarter 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we charged $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, to compensation
expense related to these awards. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we charged $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these awards. There were no distributions from the DCPP
during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       10. Restricted Stock, Performance Share and Cash
Awards        Restricted Stock Awards       As discussed in Note 8 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements, on May 13, 2014, our stockholders approved the LTIP, which replaced our previous stockholder-approved 2011 LTIP. The
LTIP provides for the grant of a stock award either as restricted stock or as restricted stock units. In either case, the compensation committee may determine that the award will be subject to the attainment of performance measures over an
established performance period. Stock awards and the related dividend equivalents are non-transferable and subject to forfeiture if the holder does not remain continuously employed with us during the applicable restriction period or, in the case of
a performance-based award, if applicable performance measures are not attained. The compensation committee will determine all of the terms relating to the satisfaction of performance measures and the termination of a restriction period, or the
forfeiture and cancellation of a restricted stock award upon a termination of employment, whether by reason of disability, retirement, death or any other reason. The compensation committee may grant unrestricted shares of common stock or units
representing the right to receive shares of common stock to employees who have attained age 62.      The agreements awarding restricted stock
units under the LTIP will specify whether such awards may be settled in shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of shares and cash and whether the holder will be entitled to receive dividend equivalents, on a current or deferred basis,
with respect to such award. Prior to the settlement of a restricted stock unit, the holder of a restricted stock unit will have no rights as a stockholder of the company. The maximum number of shares available under the LTIP for restricted
stock, restricted stock units and performance unit awards settled with stock (i.e., all awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights) is 2.0 million. At September 30, 2016, 1.0 million shares were available for
grant under the LTIP for such awards.      In the first quarter of each of 2016 and 2015, we granted 466,600 and 362,600 restricted stock units,
respectively, to employees under the LTIP, with an aggregate fair value of $20.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively, at the date of grant. These 2016 and 2015 awards of restricted stock units vest as follows: 466,600 units granted in first
quarter 2016 and 362,600 units granted in first quarter 2015, vest in full based on continued employment through March 11, 2020 and March 11, 2019, respectively. For certain of our executive officers age 55 or older, restricted stock units awarded
in 2016 and 2015 are no longer subject to forfeiture upon such officers  departure from the company after two years from the date of grant.      We account for restricted stock awards at historical cost, which equals its fair market value at the date of grant, which is amortized to compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the
participants. Future changes in the fair value of our common stock that is owed to the participants do not have any impact on the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements. During the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $4.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted in 2007 through 2016. During the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $14.2 million and $10.7 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted in 2007 through 2016. The total intrinsic value of unvested
restricted stock units at September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $79.7 million and $57.3 million, respectively. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, equity awards (including accrued dividends) with an
aggregate fair value of $14.2 million and $10.2 million were vested and distributed to employees under this plan.

    Performance Share Awards       On March 17, 2016 and March 11, 2015, pursuant to the LTIP, the compensation committee approved 72,900 and 53,900, respectively of provisional performance unit awards, with an aggregate fair
value of $3.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for future grants to our officers. Each performance unit award was equivalent to the value of one share of our common stock on the date such provisional award was approved. These awards are
subject to a one-year performance period based on our financial performance and a two-year vesting period. At the discretion of the compensation committee and determined based on our performance, the eligible officer will be granted a percentage of
the provisional performance unit award that equates to the EBITAC growth achieved (as specified in the applicable grant agreement). At the end of the performance period, eligible participants will be granted a number of units based on achievement of
the performance goal and subject to approval by the compensation committee. Granted units for the 2016 and 2015 provisional awards will fully vest based on continuous employment through January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, respectively, and
will be settled in shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis as soon as practicable in 2019 and 2018, respectively. For certain of our executive officers age 55 or older, awards granted in 2016 and 2015 are no longer subject to forfeiture
upon such officers  departure from the company after two years from the date of grant. If an eligible employee leaves us prior to the vesting date, the entire award will be forfeited.      Cash Awards       On March 17, 2016, pursuant to our Performance Unit Program (which we
refer to as the Program), the compensation committee approved provisional cash awards of $17.4 million in the aggregate for future grants to our officers and key employees that are denominated in units (397,000 units in the aggregate), each of which
was equivalent to the value of one share of our common stock on the date the provisional award was approved. The Program consists of a one-year performance period based on our financial performance and a two-year vesting period. At the discretion of
the compensation committee and determined based on our performance, the eligible officer or key employee will be granted a percentage of the provisional cash award units that equates to the EBITAC growth achieved (as defined in the Program). At the
end of the performance period, eligible participants will be granted a number of units based on achievement of the performance goal and subject to approval by the compensation committee. Granted units for the 2016 provisional award will fully vest
based on continuous employment through January 1, 2019. For certain of our executive officers age 55 or older, awards granted under the Program in 2016 are no longer subject to forfeiture upon such officers  departure from the company
after two years from the date of the provisional award. The ultimate award value will be equal to the trailing twelve-month price of our common stock on December 31, 2018, multiplied by the number of units subject to the award, but limited to
between 0.5 and 1.5 times the original value of the units determined as of the grant date. The fair value of the awarded units will be paid out in cash as soon as practicable in 2019. If an eligible employee leaves us prior to the vesting date, the
entire award will be forfeited. We did not recognize any compensation expense during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 related to the 2016 provisional award under the Program.  
  On March 11, 2015, pursuant to the Program, the compensation committee approved provisional cash awards of $14.6 million in the aggregate for future
grant to our officers and key employees that are denominated in units (315,000 units in the aggregate), each of which was equivalent to the value of one share of our common stock on the date the provisional awards were approved. Terms of the 2015
provisional awards were similar to the terms of the 2016 provisional awards. Based on our performance for 2015, we granted 294,000 units under the Program in first quarter 2016 that will fully vest on January 1, 2018. During the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $1.7 million to compensation expense related to these awards. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $4.9 million to compensation expense related to these awards.
We did not recognize any compensation expense during 2015 related to the 2015 awards.      On March 12, 2014, pursuant to the Program, the
compensation committee approved provisional cash awards of $10.8 million in the aggregate for future grant to our officers and key employees that are denominated in units (229,000 units in the aggregate), each of which was equivalent to the value of
one share of our common stock on the date the provisional awards were approved. Terms of the 2014 provisional awards were similar to the terms of the 2015 provisional awards. Based on our performance for 2014, we granted 220,000 units under the
Program in first quarter 2015 that will fully vest on January 1, 2017. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $1.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these
awards. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $3.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, to compensation expense related to these awards.     On March 13, 2013, pursuant to the Program, the compensation committee approved provisional cash awards of $10.5 million in the aggregate for future grant to our officers and key employees that are
denominated in units (269,000 units in the aggregate), each of which was equivalent to the value of one share of our common stock on the date

the provisional awards were approved. Terms of the 2013 provisional awards were similar to the terms of the 2015 provisional awards. Based on our performance for 2013, we granted 263,000 units
under the Program in first quarter 2014 that fully vested on January 1, 2016. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, we recognized $1.3 million to compensation expense related to the 2013 awards. During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2015, we recognized $4.3 million to compensation expense related to the 2013 awards.      During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, cash awards related to the 2013 provisional award with an aggregate fair value of $11.2 million (0.2 million units in the aggregate) were vested and distributed to employees under the Program.  
   11. Retirement Plans       We have a
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that, prior to July 1, 2005, covered substantially all of our domestic employees who had attained a specified age and one year of employment. Benefits under the plan were based on years of service
and salary history. In 2005, we amended our defined benefit pension plan to freeze the accrual of future benefits for all U.S. employees, effective on July 1, 2005. In the table below, the service cost component represents plan administration
costs that are incurred directly by the plan.      The components of the net periodic pension benefit cost for the plan consists of the following
(in millions):       
    We are not required under the IRC to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2016 plan year nor were we
required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2015 plan year. This level of required funding is based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding. We did not make any discretionary contributions to
the plan during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       12. Investments    
  The following is a summary of our investments and the related funding commitments (in millions):

    Chem-Mod LLC  - At September 30, 2016, we held a 46.5% controlling interest in Chem-Mod. Chem-Mod
possesses the exclusive marketing rights, in the U.S. and Canada, for technologies used to reduce emissions created during the combustion of coal. The refined coal production plants discussed below, as well as those owned by other unrelated parties,
license and use Chem-Mod s proprietary technologies, The Chem-Mod  Solution, in the production of refined coal. The  Chem-Mod   Solution uses a dual injection sorbent system to reduce mercury,
sulfur dioxide and other emissions at  coal-fired  power plants.     We believe that the application of The
Chem-Mod  Solution qualifies for refined coal tax credits under IRC Section 45 when used with refined coal production plants placed in service by December 31, 2011 or 2009.  Chem-Mod  has been
marketing its technologies principally to coal-fired power plants owned by utility companies, including those utilities that are operating with the IRC Section 45 refined coal production plants in which we hold an investment.  
  Chem-Mod is determined to be a variable interest entity (which we refer to as a VIE). We are the manager (decision maker) of Chem-Mod and therefore
consolidate its operations into our consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2016, total assets and total liabilities of this VIE included in our consolidated balance sheet were $11.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2015, total assets and total liabilities of this VIE were $10.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, total revenues and expenses were $48.2 million and $1.8 million,
respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, total revenues and expenses were $55.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively. We are under no obligation to fund Chem-Mod s operations in the future.   
   Chem-Mod International LLC  - At September 30, 2016, we held a 31.5% non-controlling ownership interest in Chem-Mod International. Chem-Mod
International has the rights to market The Chem-Mod  Solution in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. Such marketing activity has been limited to date.       C-Quest Technologies LLC and C-Quest Technologies International LLC (together, C-Quest)  - At September 30, 2016, we held a non-controlling 12% interest in
 C-Quest s  global entities.  C-Quest  possesses rights, information and technology for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels. Thus
far, C-Quest s operations have been limited to laboratory testing.  C-Quest  is determined to be a VIE, but we do not consolidate this investment into our consolidated financial statements because we are
not the primary beneficiary or decision maker. We have an option to acquire an additional 15% interest in  C-Quest s  global entities for $7.5 million at any time on or prior to August 1,
2017.      Clean Coal Investments -    

We have investments in limited liability companies that own 34 refined coal production plants which produce refined coal using propriety technologies
owned by Chem-Mod. We believe the production and sale of refined coal at these plants is qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under IRC Section 45. The fourteen plants placed in service prior to December 31, 2009 (which we refer
to as the 2009 Era Plants) are eligible to receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants placed in service prior to December 31, 2011 (which we refer to as the 2011 Era Plants) are eligible to receive tax credits through 2021.

On March 1, 2013, we purchased an additional ownership interest in twelve of the 2009 Era Plants from a
 co-investor.  For nine of the plants, our ownership increased from 24.5% to 49.5%. Our investment in these nine plants had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting until the March 1, 2014
transaction described below. For the other three of the plants, our ownership increased from 25.0% to 60.0%. Our investment in these plants had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of March 1, 2013, we consolidated the
operations of the limited liability company that owns these three plants. For the  nine-months  ended September 30, 2016, total revenues and expenses recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings
related to this acquisition were $138.1 million and $142.0 million (net of noncontrolling interests), respectively. Total revenues and expenses recorded in our unaudited consolidated statement of earnings for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015 related to this acquisition were $186.5 million and $191.0 million, respectively.          

On March 1, 2014, we purchased additional ownership interests from a co-investor in four limited liability companies that own seven 2009 Era
Plants and five 2011 Era Plants. We recognized a gain of $25.6 million as a component of other net revenues in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statement of earnings, which included the increase in fair value of our prior equity interests in
the limited liability companies upon the acquisition of the additional equity interests, and recorded $26.3 million of fixed and other amortizable intangible assets in connection with this transaction. The carrying value of our prior non-controlling
interest in the limited liability company was $15.6 million as of the acquisition date. The fair value of our prior      
         - 26 -

Table of Contents  

non-controlling  interest in the limited liability company was determined by allocating, on a pro rata basis, the fair value of the limited liability
company as adjusted for our lack of control in our prior ownership position. We determined the fair value of the limited liability company using similar valuation techniques to those discussed in Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements.
For seven of the 2009 Era plants, our ownership increased from 49.5% to 100.0%. For the 2011 Era plants, our ownership increased from 48.8% to 90.0% for one of the plants, from 49.0% to 100.0% for three of the plants and from 98.0% to 100.0% for one
of the plants. Our investments in the plants where our ownership was less than 50% had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of March 1, 2014 we consolidated the operations of the limited liability companies that own
these plants. Total revenues and expenses recorded in our unaudited consolidated statement of earnings for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 related to this acquisition were $275.2 million and $299.4 million, respectively. Total
revenues and expenses recorded in our unaudited consolidated statement of earnings for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 related to this acquisition were $404.4 million and $428.8 million, respectively.

Thirty-one of the plants have long-term production contracts.     

The remaining three plants are in various stages of seeking and negotiating  long-term  production
contracts.         

We have a non-controlling interest in one plant, which is owned by a limited liability company (which we refer to as a LLC). We have determined that
this LLC is a VIE, for which we are not the primary beneficiary. At September 30, 2016, total assets and total liabilities of this VIE were $15.2 million and $12.8 million, respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
total revenues and expenses of this VIE were $38.8 million and $48.4 million, respectively.         

We and our co-investors each fund our portion of the on-going operations of the limited liability companies in proportion to our investment ownership
percentages. Other than our portion of the on-going operational funding, there are no additional amounts that we are committed to related to funding these investments.          Other Investments -  At September 30, 2016, we owned a non-controlling, minority interest in four venture capital funds totaling $2.1 million, a 13.7% non-controlling interest in an investment
management company totaling $0.5 million, twelve certified low-income housing developments with zero carrying value and two real estate entities with zero carrying value. The low-income housing developments and real estate entities have been
determined to be VIEs, but are not required to be consolidated due to our lack of control over their respective operations. At September 30, 2016, total assets and total debt of these VIEs were approximately $60.0 million and $20.0 million,
respectively.      13. Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  In connection with our investing and operating activities, we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments. See Notes 6 and 12 to
these unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments. Our future minimum cash payments, including interest, associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to the note purchase
agreements, Credit Agreement, Premium Financing Debt Facility, operating leases and purchase commitments at September 30, 2016 were as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents  

   The amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding
requirements, because the actual timing of future payments may vary from the stated contractual obligation. Outstanding purchase commitments in the table above include $43.2 million related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters.
      Note Purchase Agreements, Credit Agreement and Premium Financing Debt Facility  - See Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements, the Credit Agreement and Premium Financing Debt Facility.   
   Operating Lease Obligations  - Our corporate segment s executive offices and certain subsidiary and branch facilities of our brokerage and
risk management segments are located at Two Pierce Place, Itasca, Illinois, where we lease approximately 306,000 square feet of space, or approximately 60% of the building. The lease commitment on this property expires February 28, 2018. In
August 2015, we announced that we will be relocating our headquarters to the city of Rolling Meadows, Illinois, which will have approximately 360,000 square feet of space and will accommodate approximately 2,000 employees at peak capacity. We
anticipate moving to the Rolling Meadows site sometime in the first quarter of 2017. Relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters, we expect to receive property tax related credits under a tax-increment financing note from Rolling
Meadows and an Illinois state Economic Development for a Growing Economy (which we refer to as Edge) tax credit. Incentives from these two programs could total between $60.0 million and $80.0 million over a fifteen-year period.   
  We generally operate in leased premises at our other locations. Certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods. In
addition to minimum fixed rentals, a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index.      We have leased certain office space to several non-affiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements. In the normal course of business, we expect that certain of these leases will not be renewed or
replaced. We adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses, and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred. These amounts are not included in the minimum
future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above.       Outstanding Purchase Obligations  - We typically do not have
a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time. The amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we had outstanding at
September 30, 2016. These obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business.       Off-Balance Sheet Commitments  - Our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, financial guarantees and funding commitments as of September 30, 2016 were as
follows (in millions):       
    Since commitments may expire unused, the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual
future cash funding requirements. See Note 12 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the Off-Balance Sheet Debt section below for a discussion of our
letters of credit. All of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual, automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date. In addition, funding commitments in the table above includes $3.3
million related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building.      Since January 1, 2002, we have acquired 411 companies,
all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations. Substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations. For all of our
acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2016 that contain potential earnout obligations, such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the
respective acquisition. The amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate amount of the
maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was $503.8 million, of which $225.0 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to
be made.

    Off-Balance Sheet Debt -  Our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises
where our ownership interest is between 1% and 50%, in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation. As a result, these investments are accounted for under the equity
method. None of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 that was recourse to us.      At September 30, 2016, we had posted two letters of credit totaling $9.3 million, in the aggregate, related to our self-insurance deductibles, for which we had a recorded liability of $12.0 million.
We have an equity investment in a rent-a-captive facility, which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations. At September 30, 2016, we had posted seven letters of credit totaling $6.3 million to allow
certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity, one letter of credit totaling $5.0 million to support our potential
obligation under a client s insurance program and one letter of credit totaling $0.5 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition s lease. These letters of credit have never been drawn upon.   
   Litigation, Regulatory and Taxation Matters -  We are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to the nature of our business including but
not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of  non-compete  or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties and related causes of action. We are
also periodically the subject of inquiries, investigations and reviews by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business, including our operational, compliance and finance functions. Neither the outcomes of these
matters nor their effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations can be determined at this time.      In July 2014, we
were named in a lawsuit that asserts that we, our subsidiary, Gallagher Clean Energy, LLC, and Chem-Mod LLC are liable for infringement of a patent held by Nalco Company. The complaint sought a judgment of infringement, damages, costs and
attorneys  fees, and injunctive relief. Along with other defendants, we disputed the allegation of infringement and have defended this matter vigorously. We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on behalf of all defendants, alleging no
infringement of Nalco s intellectual property. This motion, and similar motions attacking amended complaints filed by Nalco, were granted. On April 21, 2016, the court dismissed Nalco s claims and disallowed leave to file any further
amended complaint. Although Nalco has appealed this ruling, we believe that the probability of a material loss is remote. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate disposition of this
proceeding.      Our micro-captive advisory services are under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Additionally, the IRS has
initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the micro-captive insurance companies organized and/or managed by us. Among other matters, the IRS is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these
operations. While the IRS has not made specific allegations relating to our operations, if the IRS were to successfully assert that the micro-captives organized and/or managed by us do not meet the requirements of IRC Section 831(b), we could be
held liable to pay monetary claims by the IRS and/or our micro-captive clients, and our future earnings from our micro-captive operations could be materially adversely affected, any of which events, could negatively impact the overall captive
business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Due to the early stage of the investigation and the fact that the IRS has not made any allegation against us or completed its audits of our clients, we are
not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation.       Contingent Liabilities -  We
purchase insurance to provide protection from errors and omissions (which we refer to as E O) claims that may arise during the ordinary course of business. We currently retain the first $5.0 million of each and every E O claim. Our E O
insurance provides aggregate coverage for E O losses up to $175.0 million in excess of our retained amounts. We have historically maintained self-insurance reserves for the portion of our E O exposure that is not insured. We periodically
determine a range of possible reserve levels using actuarial techniques that rely heavily on projecting historical claim data into the future. Our E O reserve in the September 30, 2016 unaudited consolidated balance sheet is above the lower
end of the most recently determined actuarial range by $1.1 million and below the upper end of the actuarial range by $7.9 million. We can make no assurances that the historical claim data used to project the current reserve levels will be
indicative of future claim activity. Thus, the E O reserve level and corresponding actuarial range could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could materially impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.

    Tax-advantaged Investments No Longer Held -  Between 1996 and 2007, we developed and then sold
portions of our ownership in various energy related investments, many of which qualified for tax credits under IRC Section 29. In connection with the sales to other investors, we provided various indemnifications. At September 30, 2016,
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnifications totaled approximately $32.0 million, net of the applicable income tax benefit. In addition, we recorded tax benefits in connection with
our ownership in these investments. At September 30, 2016, we had exposure on $109.0 million of previously earned tax credits. In 2004, 2007 and 2009, the IRS examined several of these investments and all examinations were closed without any
changes being proposed by the IRS. However, any future adverse tax audits, administrative rulings or judicial decisions could disallow previously claimed tax credits or cause us to be subject to liability under our indemnification obligations.
Because of the contingent nature of these exposures and our related assessment of their likelihood, no liabilities have been recorded in our September 30, 2016 consolidated balance sheet related to these indemnification obligations.   
   14. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings (Loss)       The after-tax components of our accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) attributable to controlling interests consist of the following:  
   
    The foreign currency translation during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 primarily relates to the net
impact of changes in the value of the local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar for our operations in Australia, Canada, the Caribbean, India, New Zealand and the U.K.     During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $4.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of expense related to the pension liability was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive earnings (loss) to compensation expense in the statement of earnings. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $0.2 million and $0.1 million of income, respectively, related to the fair value of derivative
investments, was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) to the statement of earnings. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no amounts related to foreign currency translation were
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) to the statement of earnings.      15. Segment Information    
  We have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate.     The brokerage segment is primarily comprised of our retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations. The brokerage segment generates revenues through commissions paid by insurance underwriters and
through fees charged to our clients. Our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks.     The risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to self-insure some or all of their property/casualty coverages and for insurance
companies that choose to outsource some or all of their property/casualty claims departments. These operations also provide claims management, loss control consulting and insurance property appraisal services. Revenues are principally generated on a
negotiated per-claim or per-service fee basis.     The corporate segment manages our clean energy and other investments. In addition, the
corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt, and certain corporate and acquisition-related activities.     Allocations
of investment income and certain expenses are based on what management believes are reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue, headcount and other information. We allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk
management segments using the local country statutory rates. Reported operating results by segment would change if different methods were applied.

    Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
  The interim consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2016 and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 have been reviewed by Ernst   Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and their report is included herein.         Review Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
  Board of Directors and Stockholders      Arthur J.
Gallagher   Co.      We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of Arthur J. Gallagher   Co. as of September 30, 2016, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and the consolidated statement of stockholders  equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.   
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.   
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for
them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.      We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Arthur J. Gallagher   Co. as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
stockholders  equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, not presented herein, and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated February 10, 2016. In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arthur J. Gallagher   Co. as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

      Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations       The discussion and analysis that follows relates to our financial condition and results of operations for the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016. Readers should review this information in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report on  Form 10-Q  and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015.       Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements    
  This report contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future, which
are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements use words such as
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   contemplate,   forecast,   project,   intend,   plan,   potential,  and other similar terms, and
future or conditional tense verbs like  could,   may,   might,   see,   should,   will  and  would.  You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not
relate strictly to historical or current facts. For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: market and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends; acquisition strategy; the expected impact of
acquisitions and dispositions; the development and performance of our services and products; changes in the composition or level of our revenues or earnings; our cost structure and the outcome of cost-saving or restructuring initiatives; future
capital expenditures; future debt to earnings ratios; the outcome of contingencies; dividend policy; pension obligations; cash flow and liquidity; capital structure and financial losses; future actions by regulators; the outcome of existing
regulatory actions, investigations, reviews or litigation; the impact of changes in accounting rules; financial markets; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; matters relating to our operations; income taxes; expectations regarding our
investments, including our clean energy investments; the financial impact of retention agreements in our international brokerage operations; and integrating recent acquisitions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors.  
  Potential factors that could impact results include:      

Failure to successfully and cost-effectively integrate recently acquired businesses and their operations or fully realize synergies from such
acquisitions in the expected time frame;          

Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry;      

An economic downturn (for example, due to the recent Brexit vote);      

Competitive pressures in each of our businesses;          

Risks that could negatively affect the success of our acquisition strategy, including continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in
acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms, which could make it more difficult to identify targets and could make them more expensive, the risk that we may not receive timely regulatory approval of desired transactions,
execution risks, integration risks, the risk of post-acquisition deterioration leading to intangible asset impairment charges, and the risk we could incur or assume unanticipated regulatory liabilities such as those relating to violations of
anti-corruption and sanctions laws;          

Our failure to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel;      

Risks arising from our international operations, including the risks posed by political and economic uncertainty in certain countries (such as the
risks posed by the recent Brexit vote and protectionist local governments and underdeveloped or evolving legal systems), risks related to maintaining regulatory and legal compliance across multiple jurisdictions (such as those relating to violations
of anti-corruption, sanctions and privacy laws), and risks arising from the complexity of managing businesses across different time zones, geographies, cultures and legal regimes;      

Risks particular to our risk management segment;          

The lower level of predictability inherent in contingent and supplemental commissions versus standard commissions;      

Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits;

The risk of share ownership dilution when we issue common stock as consideration for acquisitions and for other reasons; and

Volatility of the price of our common stock.         Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of, and are based on information available to us on, the date of the applicable document. All subsequent
written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to
update any such statements or release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.   
  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risk factors
referred to above. Our future performance and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   
  A detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our published expectations is contained under the heading
 Risk Factors  in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015, and any other reports we file with the SEC in the future.

    Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures and Other    
  In the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we provide
information regarding EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted EPS) for the brokerage and risk management segments, adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation and
operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the GAAP information provided in this
quarterly report on  Form 10-Q.  We believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of
operations and financial condition. Our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical
adjustments. The non-GAAP information we provide should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the GAAP information provided. As disclosed in our most recent Proxy Statement, we do not make determinations regarding executive officer
incentive compensation on the basis of  adjusted  measures such as those described below in  Adjusted revenues and expenses  or  Adjusted EBITDAC . Instead, incentive compensation determinations for executive officers
are made on the basis of revenue and EBITAC (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and change in estimated earnout payables) for the combined brokerage and risk management segments. Certain reclassifications have been made to the
prior-year amounts reported in this quarterly report on  Form 10-Q  in order to conform them to the current-year presentation.       Adjusted Non-GAAP presentation  - We believe that the adjusted Non-GAAP presentations of the current and prior year information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other
interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us. The after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were
computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period.       

Adjusted revenues and expenses  - We define these measures as revenues, compensation expense and operating expense, respectively, each adjusted
to exclude the following:          

Net gains realized from sales of books of business, which are primarily net proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other
divestiture transactions.          

Acquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain of our large acquisitions, outside the scope of our usual tuck-in strategy, not
expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate the applicable acquisition. These costs are typically associated with redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate
the acquisition with our IT related systems.          

Workforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs related to employee terminations and other costs associated with redundant
workforce.          

Lease termination related charges, which primarily include costs related to terminations of real estate leases and abandonment of leased space.

Acquisition related adjustments, which include change in estimated acquisition earnout payables adjustments, impacts of acquisition valuation true-ups,
impairment charges and acquisition related compensation charges.          

The impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable. The amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying
current year foreign exchange rates to the same periods in the prior year.          

Adjusted ratios  - Adjusted compensation expense and operating expense, respectively, each divided by adjusted
revenues.         Non-GAAP Earnings Measures  - We believe that the presentation of EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC,
adjusted EBITDAC margin and adjusted EPS for the brokerage and risk management segment, each as defined below, provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance. Adjusted EPS is a performance measure and should not be used as a
measure of our liquidity. We also consider EBITDAC and EBITDAC margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis. In addition, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin and adjusted EPS for the brokerage and risk management
segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.

EBITDAC  - Net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables.

EBITDAC margin  - EBITDAC divided by total revenues.      

Adjusted EBITDAC  - EBITDAC adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs, workforce related
charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable.     

Adjusted EBITDAC margin  - Adjusted EBITDAC divided by total adjusted revenues (defined above).      

Adjusted EPS for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments  - We define this measure as net earnings adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of
gains realized from sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges and acquisition related adjustments, the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as
applicable, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.         Organic Revenues  - For the brokerage segment,
organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented.
These commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year. In addition, change in
base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the   period-over-period   impact of foreign currency translation. For the risk management segment, organic change in
fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. In addition, change in organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of
foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limited-time nature of these revenue sources.   
  These revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated
with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in the current year and beyond. We have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management
segments. We also believe that using this  non-GAAP  measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful
and consistent manner.       Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information Presented to GAAP Measures  - This quarterly report on  Form 10-Q  includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures for adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense, EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC,
adjusted EBITDAC margin, diluted net earnings per share (as adjusted) and organic revenue measures.       Other Information  - Allocations of
investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue, headcount and other information. We allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local
statutory rates. As a result, the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the IRC Section 45 credits produced, because that is the segment which generated the credits. The law that provides for
IRC Section 45 credits substantially expires in December 2019 for our fourteen 2009 Era Plants and in December 2021 for our twenty 2011 Era Plants. We anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 34.0% to 36.0% in the
brokerage segment and 36.0% to 38.0% in the risk management segment for the foreseeable future. Reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied.     In the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations, we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results: pretax profit margin, compensation expense ratio and
operating expense ratio. Pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings divided by total revenues. The compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues. The operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total
revenues.

    Overview and Third Quarter 2016 Highlights       We are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third-party property/casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the U.S. and abroad. In the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016, we generated approximately 69% of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically and 31% internationally, primarily in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the U.K. We
have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate, which contributed approximately 63%, 12% and 25%, respectively, to revenues during the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016.
Our major sources of operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations. Investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds,
clean energy and other investments, and interest income from premium financing.      We typically cite the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers
(which we refer to as CIAB) insurance pricing quarterly survey at this time as an indicator of the current insurance rate environment, but the third quarter 2016 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report. We anticipate that
the trends noted in the second quarter 2016 survey will likely be similar to what will be reported for third quarter 2016. The first quarter 2016 CIAB survey indicated that commercial property/casualty rates decreased by 3.7%, on average, across all
lines. The second quarter 2016 CIAB survey indicated that commercial property/casualty rates decreased by 3.9%, on average, across all lines. We believe the current domestic insurance rate environment is stable and we are seeing some signs of the
bottom of the rate cycle in select geographies outside the U.S., including Australia and New Zealand. Based on our experience, insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions. In specific insurance lines and accounts where rate
increases or decreases are warranted, the underwriters are pricing accordingly. Overall, we believe that when rates are quoted down modestly, our professionals demonstrate their expertise and high quality value-added capabilities. They do this by
mitigating pricing through exposure unit growth in certain lines which strengthens our clients  insurance portfolios. Our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners
should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. The CIAB represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers, who write approximately 85% of the commercial property/casualty premiums in the U.S.

    Results of Operations        Brokerage       The brokerage segment accounted for 63% of our revenues during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016. Our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations. Our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place property/casualty, employer-provided health and welfare insurance
and retirement solutions, principally for middle-market commercial, industrial, public entity, religious and not-for-profit entities. Many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters, while others
choose to use alternative vehicles such as self-insurance pools, risk retention groups or captive insurance companies. Our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized,
unique and  hard-to-place  insurance programs.      Our primary sources of compensation for our retail
brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies, which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds, and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients. For wholesale brokerage services, we generally
receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer. Commission rates are dependent on a number of factors, including the type of insurance, the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a
retail or wholesale broker. Advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide. In addition, under certain circumstances, both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions.
A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commissions paid, is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance
criteria. A contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and/or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual
period.      Litigation and Regulatory Matters -  A portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of
 micro-captives,  through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of Tribeca Strategic Advisors (Tribeca). A  captive  is an insurance company that insures the risks of its owner, affiliates or a group of
companies. Micro-captives are captive insurance companies that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under IRC Section 831(b). Our micro-captive advisory services are under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Additionally, the IRS has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the micro-captive insurance companies organized and/or managed by us. Among other matters, the IRS is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter
in connection with these operations. While the IRS has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the pre-acquisition activities of Tribeca, if the IRS were to successfully assert that the micro-captives organized and/or managed by
us do not meet the requirements of IRC Section 831(b), we could be held liable to pay monetary claims by the IRS and/or our micro-captive clients, and our future earnings from our micro-captive operations could be materially adversely affected, any
of which events could negatively impact the overall captive business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended IRS
investigation on our clients  and potential clients  businesses. Annual renewals for micro-captive clients generally occur during the fourth quarter. Therefore, any negative impact from this investigation would likely have a
disproportionate impact on fourth-quarter results. In 2015, our micro-captive operations contributed approximately $3.9 million in EBITDAC and $1.9 million in net earnings to our consolidated results. Due to the fact that the IRS is still completing
its investigation and has not made any allegation against us or completed its audits of our clients, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation.

  Prior to September 1, 2016, most of our India-based workforce was provided by a third-party on a cost-pass-through basis. During the three-month period ended
September 30, 2016, we consummated a transaction whereby we now directly employ those associates thereby adding approximately 2,700 employees to our global workforce counts, of which approximately 2,200 employees were included in the

   The following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing EBITDAC and adjusted
EBITDAC for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 to the same periods in 2015 (in millions):       
    Acquisition integration costs include costs related to our July 2, 2014 acquisition of Noraxis Capital Corporation
(which we refer to as Noraxis), our June 16, 2014 acquisition of the Crombie/OAMPS operations (which we refer to as Crombie/OAMPS), our April 1, 2014 acquisition of Oval Group of Companies (which we refer to as Oval), our November 14,
2013 acquisition of the Giles Group of Companies (which we refer to as Giles) and our August 1, 2015 acquisition of William Gallagher Associates Insurance Brokers (which we refer to as WGA) that are not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in
the future once we fully assimilate these acquisitions. These costs relate to the on-boarding of employees, communication system conversion costs, related performance compensation, redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate services and
external costs incurred to assimilate the acquired businesses with our IT related systems. The WGA integration costs in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 totaled $2.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively, and
were primarily related to retention and incentive compensation. The Noraxis integration costs in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 totaled $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and were primarily related to
the consolidation of offices, technology costs and incentive compensation. The Crombie/OAMPS integration costs in the three-month and  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2016 totaled $0.9 million and
$4.0 million, respectively, and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation. The Giles and Oval integration costs in the  three-month  and nine-month periods September 30, 2016
totaled $5.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the U.K., technology costs, branding and incentive compensation. The Noraxis integration costs in the three-month and  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2015 totaled $1.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively, and were primarily related to the onboarding of over 650 employees. The Crombie/OAMPS integration costs in the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 totaled $4.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively, and were primarily related to technology costs, the onboarding of over 1,700 employees and incentive compensation. The Giles and
Oval integration costs in the  three-month  and nine-month periods September 30, 2015 totaled $17.2 million and $42.2 million, respectively, and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the
U.K., technology costs, the onboarding of over 2,000 employees, branding and incentive compensation. The prior period integration costs relate to the Noraxis, Crombie/OAMPS, Oval and Giles acquisitions only. Integration costs related to these
acquisitions for the full year in 2016 are estimated to be less than half of what they were in 2015.

    Commissions and fees  - The aggregate increase in commissions and fees for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was principally due to combination of revenues associated with acquisitions that were made in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016 ($38.4 million) and to
organic growth. Commissions and fees in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 included new business production of $83.2 million, which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of
$86.4 million. Organic growth in commissions and fee revenues was 2.4% in each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      The aggregate increase in commissions and fees for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was principally due to combination of revenues associated with
acquisitions that were made in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016 ($139.3 million) and to organic growth. Commissions and fees in the  nine-month  period ended September 30,
2016 included new business production of $263.2 million, which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of $258.6 million. Organic growth in commissions and fee revenues for the
 nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016 was 2.6% compared to 4.0% for the same period in 2015. The decrease in organic growth in commissions and fee revenues was principally due to renewal rate
decreases and the loss of one large account in 2016, partially offset by good account retention and new business generated.     Items excluded
from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for the three-month and  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include the following (in millions):

     Investment income and gains realized on books of business sales -  Investment income primarily represents interest
income earned on cash, cash equivalents and restricted funds and interest income from premium financing. Gains related to sales of books of business were $1.1 million and $2.6 million for the three-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and $4.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Investment income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased slightly compared
to the same period in 2015. The decrease in investment income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in interest income from our premium financing business and
in interest income earned on client held funds, both of which were related to a decline in interest rates in Australia and New Zealand.

   The increase in compensation expense for the  three-month  period
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount, salary increases and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results ($16.9 million in the aggregate),
increases in employee benefits ($8.3 million), severance related costs ($3.1 million), stock compensation expense ($0.9 million), deferred compensation ($0.8 million) and temporary staffing ($0.3 million), offset by a
decrease in earnout related compensation expense ($0.2 million). The increase in employee headcount primarily relates to employees associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016.   
  The increase in compensation expense for the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount, salary increases and increases in incentive compensation ($70.0 million in the aggregate), increases in employee benefits ($15.0 million), stock compensation expense
($3.7 million), deferred compensation ($2.0 million) and temporary staffing ($1.1 million), offset by decreases in severance related costs ($6.2 million) and earnout related compensation expense ($0.7 million). The increase
in employee headcount primarily relates to employees associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016.       Operating expense -  The following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing operating expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
with the same periods in 2015 (in millions):       
    The decrease in operating expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015 was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation ($0.3 million) and decreases in professional and banking fees ($4.4 million), technology expenses ($3.8 million), business insurance ($3.7 million), other expense
($2.8 million), bad debt expense ($1.6 million), licenses and fees ($1.3 million), office supplies ($1.1 million), lease termination charges ($0.5 million), employee related expense ($0.1 million) and premium financing
expense ($0.1 million), partially offset by increases in outside consulting fees ($2.0 million), real estate expenses ($1.5 million), and meeting and client entertainment expense ($0.8 million). Also impacting operating
expense in the  three-month  period ended September 30, 2016 were expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the  twelve-month  period ended
September 30, 2016.     The decrease in operating expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in business insurance ($10.4 million), technology expenses ($7.5 million), professional and banking fees ($4.5 million), bad debt expense ($2.1 million), licenses and fees
($1.9 million), other expense ($1.0 million), premium financing expense ($0.5 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($0.4 million) and increases in outside consulting fees ($4.9 million),
meeting and client entertainment expense ($4.0 million), real estate expenses ($2.1 million), office supplies ($1.0 million), employee related expense ($0.7 million) and lease termination charges ($0.4 million). Also
impacting operating expense in the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the  twelve-month 
period ended September 30, 2016.      Depreciation  - Depreciation expense in the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 increased slightly compared to the same periods in 2015 due to expenses associated with acquisitions completed in the  twelve-month  period ended September 30, 2016.

    Amortization  - The increases in amortization expense in the
 three-month  and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 were primarily due to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed in
the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016. Expiration lists, non-compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (three to fifteen years for expiration lists, three to
five years for non-compete agreements and five to ten years for trade names).       Change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  - The
change in expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in the  three-month  period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to adjustments made to
the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $4.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of
expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2016. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized
$12.5 million and $12.2 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2016. In addition, during the  three-month  periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.2 million of income and $6.0 million of expense, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout
obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 27 and 33 acquisitions, respectively. During the  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized
$8.7 million and $14.2 million of expense, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 77 and 70 acquisitions, respectively.
     The amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2013 to 2016 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date
and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. The fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the
expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entity s future performance
using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. We estimated future earnout payments using the earnout formula and
performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. Subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are
recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred. Increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income.
      Provision for income taxes -  The brokerage segment s effective income tax rates for the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 34.5% (34.4% on a controlling interests basis) and 38.4% (37.8% on a controlling interests basis), respectively. The brokerage segment s effective income tax rates for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 34.8% (35.2% on a controlling interests basis) and 36.4% (36.7% on a controlling interests basis), respectively. We anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 34.0% to 36.0% (on a
controlling interests basis) in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future.       Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling
interests  - The amounts reported in this line for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include non-controlling interest (loss) earnings of ($0.2) million and ($1.8) million, respectively, and $4.1 million
and $3.3 million, respectively, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, primarily related to our investment in Capsicum Reinsurance Brokers LLP (which we refer to as Capsicum). We are partners in this venture
with Grahame Chilton, the CEO of our International Brokerage Division. We are the controlling partner, participating in 33% of Capsicum s net operating results and Mr. Chilton owns approximately 50% of Capsicum.

    Risk Management       The risk management segment accounted for 12% of our revenue during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and
administration services for enterprises that choose to self-insure some or all of their property/casualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their property/casualty claims departments. In addition, this
segment generates revenues from integrated disability management programs, information services, risk control consulting (loss control) services and appraisal services, either individually or in combination with arising claims. Revenues for risk
management services are substantially in the form of fees that are generally negotiated in advance on a per-claim or per-service basis, depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed.

     Fees  - The decrease in fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 was due primarily to lower international performance bonus fees, lost business of $11.7 million and the impact of decreased claim counts, which were partially offset by new business of $9.1 million. Organic change in fee
revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was 0.7% compared to 9.7% for the same period in 2015.      The decrease in fees
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due primarily to lower international performance bonus fees, lost business of $54.9 million and the impact of decreased claim counts, which

comparing operating expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 with the same periods in 2015 (in millions):       
    The decrease in operating expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015 was primarily due to decreases in business insurance ($1.8 million), other expense ($0.7 million), bad debt expense ($0.5 million), real estate expenses ($0.5 million), technology expenses ($0.4 million), office
supplies ($0.4 million), licenses and fees ($0.3 million), employee expense ($0.2 million) and lease termination charges ($0.1 million), offset by increases in outside consulting fees ($0.7 million), professional and banking
fees ($0.3 million) and meeting and client entertainment expense ($0.1 million).      The decrease in operating expense for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in business insurance ($6.1 million), real estate expenses ($1.6 million), bad debt expense ($1.6 million), licenses
and fees ($0.9 million), other expense ($0.8 million), meeting and client entertainment expense ($0.6 million), office supplies ($0.4 million) and employee expense ($0.3 million), offset by increases in professional and
banking fees ($3.4 million), outside consulting fees ($2.3 million), technology expenses ($0.5 million) and outside services expense ($0.3 million).       Depreciation  - Depreciation expense increased slightly in the  three-month  and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods
in 2015 and reflects the impact of purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and relocations, and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems.   
   Amortization  - Amortization expense remained the same in the  three-month  period ended September 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and decreased in the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Historically, the risk management segment has made few
acquisitions. We made no acquisitions in this segment during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Change in
estimated acquisition earnout payables  - The change in income from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in the  three-month  and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the same periods in 2015, was due primarily to adjustments made in 2015 to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we
recognized $0.5 million of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for one acquisition. No such adjustments were required to be made
in 2016.       Provision for income taxes  - The risk management segment s effective income tax rates for the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 38.6% and 38.4%, respectively. The risk management segment s effective income tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 38.0% and 37.0%, respectively. We

    Revenues  - Revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following:   

Revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants represents revenues from the consolidated IRC Section 45 facilities that we operate and
control under lease arrangements, and the investments in which we have a majority ownership position and maintain control over the operations of the related plants, including those that are currently not operating. When we relinquish control in
connection with the sale of majority ownership interests in our investments, we deconsolidate these operations.     
  The increases in revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, were due to increased production.       

Royalty income from clean coal licenses represents revenues related to Chem-Mod LLC. As of September 30, 2016, we held a 46.5% controlling
interest in Chem-Mod. As Chem-Mod s manager, we are required to consolidate its operations.        The
decreases in royalty income in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, were due to reductions in production of refined coal by Chem-Mod s licensees.   
  Expenses related to royalty income of Chem-Mod in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $0.7 million
and $0.8 million, respectively. Expenses related to royalty income of Chem-Mod in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $2.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively.   

Loss from unconsolidated clean coal production plants represents our equity portion of the pretax operating results from the unconsolidated clean coal
production plants. The production of refined coal generates pretax operating losses.         The losses in the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were low because the vast majority of our operations are consolidated.      

Other net revenues include the following: In the three-month period ended March 31, 2016, we recorded $0.8 million of rental income
related to our new headquarter facility. In the same period in 2015, we recognized a $1.0 million impairment loss related to two clean coal production plants.     
  In the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a $0.4 million equity basis accounting loss related to three of our
legacy investments.     In the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, we settled litigation against certain former U.K.
executives and their advisors for a pretax $31.0 million ($22.3 million net of costs and taxes). Incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter will result in after-tax charges of approximately $4.5 million per
quarter through June 30, 2017, which will also be presented as an adjustment to the corporate segment. In the same period in 2016 we recognized a $0.6 million impairment loss related to two clean coal production plants plus
engineering costs of $0.7 million incurred for two locations that will not be used.      Cost of revenues  - Cost of revenues from
consolidated clean coal production plants, consists of the cost of coal, labor, equipment maintenance, chemicals, supplies, management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed
above, including the costs to run the leased facilities. The increases in the  three-month  and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, were due to increased
production.       Compensation expense  - Compensation expense in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, includes salary and benefit expenses of $4.0 million and $5.4 million and incentive compensation of $11.8 million and $20.2 million, respectively. The decrease in salary and benefits expense for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was due primarily to salary and benefits related to the litigation settlement expense in 2015. The decrease in incentive compensation for the  three-month  period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due primarily to the efforts in 2015 related to clean-energy performance plus the 2015 retention agreement expense related to
the 2015 litigation settlement (see note (2) on page 56).      Compensation expense in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, includes salary and benefit expenses of $13.0 million and $12.5 million and incentive compensation of $35.3 million and $31.0 million, respectively. The increase in salary and benefits expense for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was due primarily to additional benefit expense. The increase in incentive compensation for the  nine-month  period ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due primarily to the 2016 expense related to the 2015 litigation settlement (see note (2) on page 56).

The capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new headquarters building will occur
until the development of it is completed, which is estimated to be done in early 2017.       Depreciation  - Depreciation expense in the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the same period in 2015, and relates to new facilities.   
   Benefit for income taxes  - We allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory
rates. As a result, the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the IRS Section 45 credits generated, because that is the segment which produced the credits. The law that provides for IRC
Section 45 credits substantially expires in December 2019 for our fourteen 2009 Era Plants and in December 2021 for our twenty 2011 Era Plants. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was (37.4)%
compared to (33.3)% for the same period in 2015. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was (19.4)% compared to (21.0)% for the same period in 2015. The effective tax rates for the three-month and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of IRC Section 45 tax credits recognized during the respective periods. There were $144.7 million and
$144.6 million of tax credits recognized in the  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were $145.2 million and $135.8 million of tax credits produced in the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $433.7 million and $341.6 million of tax credit carryforwards recorded in deferred income tax assets in
our consolidated balance sheet.       Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests  - The amounts reported in this line for the
three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include non-controlling interest earnings of $9.1 million and $10.5 million respectively related to our investment in Chem-Mod LLC. The amounts reported in this line for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include non-controlling interest earnings of $24.8 million and $28.2 million respectively related to our investment in Chem-Mod LLC. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
held a 46.5% controlling interest in Chem-Mod.

   The following provides information that we believe is helpful when comparing our operating results for the  three-month  and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the corporate segment (in millions):       

(2)  
  During the third quarter of 2015, we settled litigation against certain former U.K. executives and their advisors for a pretax gain of $31.0 million
($22.3 million net of costs and taxes). Incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter will result in after-tax charges of up to $4.5 million per quarter through June 30, 2017.     
  Interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt. Clean energy investments include the operating results related to our investments
in clean coal production plants and Chem-Mod. Acquisition costs include professional fees, due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions. Corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff
compensation, costs related to a biennial company-wide award, cross-selling and motivational meeting for our production staff and field management.       Clean energy investments  - We have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a
third party on September 1, 2013. All 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by Chem-Mod. We believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax
credits under IRC Section 45. The fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to December 31, 2009 (which we refer to as the 2009 Era Plants) can receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants which were placed in
service prior to December 31, 2011 (which we refer to as the 2011 Era Plants) can receive tax credits through 2021.

    The information in the table above under the caption Ultimate Annual After-Tax Earnings reflects management s
current best estimate of the ultimate future potential annual after-tax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities and preliminary investment partner assumptions. Achieving these estimates in 2017 is highly dependent on
successful progress through year-end 2016 and early 2017, in both plant deployment and recruitment of investment partners to purchase portions of our Section 45 portfolio. Further, host utilities do not consistently utilize the fuel plants at
ultimate production levels due to seasonal electricity demand, weather conditions, as well as many other operational, regulatory and environmental compliance reasons. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, including Item 1A,  Risk
Factors,  on pages 17, 18 and 19 of our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact the
information above.      Our investment in Chem-Mod generates royalty income from refined coal plants owned by those limited liability companies in
which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties. Based on current production estimates provided by licensees, we believe Chem-Mod could generate for us an average of approximately $4.0 million to
$5.0 million of net after-tax earnings per quarter.       Financial Condition and Liquidity    
  Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations. The
insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive. Historically, our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, funding of our investments, acquisitions of brokerage
and risk management operations and capital expenditures.       Cash Flows From Operating Activities    
  Historically, we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash
requirements. We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. To fund acquisitions made during 2015 and
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Agreement.   
         - 57 -

Table of Contents  

   Cash provided by operating activities was $388.4 million and $326.5 million for the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015
was partially due to timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2016 compared to 2015. The following table provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in
client fiduciary related balances in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2016 with the same period in 2015 (in millions):   
   
    In addition, cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was
unfavorably impacted by unfavorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities compared to the same period in 2015. In addition, we had an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of $47.4 million in 2016 compared to
an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of $149.8 million for the same period in 2015. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations, as adjusted for realized gains and losses, and our
non-cash expenses, which include depreciation, amortization, change in estimated acquisition earnout payables, deferred compensation, restricted stock and  stock-based  and other non-cash compensation
expenses. Cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted by the amount of IRC Section 45 tax credits recognized compared to the amount of tax credits actually used during the respective periods. Excess tax credits
produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets, which is a net use of cash related to operating activities. Please see  Clean energy investments  below for more information on their potential future impact
on cash provided by operating activities.      When assessing our overall liquidity, we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as
reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, adjusted for  non-cash  items (i.e., EBITDAC), and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Consolidated EBITDAC
was $652.3 million and $608.6 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net earnings attributable to controlling interest were $319.3 million and $294.5 million for the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe that EBITDAC items are indicators of trends in liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, we believe the focus should not be on premiums and fees receivable, premiums
payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity. Net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums
payable. We believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity, they should be looked at in a combined manner, because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments,
both to and from us. In addition, funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients  claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as  Restricted Cash  and
have not been included in determining our overall liquidity.     Our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts
at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the IRC. The Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, as amended (which we refer to as ERISA), could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan. We are not required
to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2016 plan year nor were we required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2015 plan year. Funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of
our historical funding. The plan s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables
impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows, including dividends, acquisitions and
common stock repurchases. We did not make any discretionary contributions to the plan during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We are not considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in
2016, but may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods.

    Cash Flows From Investing Activities        Capital Expenditures  - Net capital expenditures were $138.8 million and $71.8 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, we expect
total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately   $200.0 million  , related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building (approximately $110.0 million), office moves and expansions and updating
computer systems and equipment. Relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters, we expect to receive property tax related credits under a  tax-increment  financing note from Rolling Meadows,
Illinois and an Illinois state Edge tax credit. Incentives from these two programs could total up to $60.0 million and $80.0 million over a fifteen-year period.       Acquisitions  - Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $208.2 million and $176.5 million in the  nine-month  periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we issued 1.9 million shares ($85.7 million) of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration
paid for 2016 acquisitions and earnout payments made in 2016. See  Common Stock Repurchases  below for information regarding shares repurchased during the nine-month period September 30, 2016 that were repurchased to fully offset shares
issued for tax-free exchange mergers in 2016. During the  nine-month  period ended September 30, 2015, we issued 7.1 million shares ($334.1 million) of our common stock as payment for
consideration paid for 2015 acquisitions and earnout payments made in 2015. We completed  twenty-eight  acquisitions and twenty-nine acquisitions in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Annualized revenues of businesses acquired in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $97.8 million and $184.5 million, respectively. We expect to use cash from
operations and debt to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete through the remainder of 2016.       Dispositions  -   During
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we sold several books of business and recognized one-time gains of $4.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively. We received cash proceeds of $7.3 million and
$8.7 million related to the 2016 and 2015 transactions, respectively.      Clean Energy Investments  - During the period 2009 through
2016, we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our current estimate of the 2016 annual after-tax earnings, including
IRC Section 45 tax credits, which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2016, is $111.0 million to $119.0 million. The IRC Section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of
Federal income taxes we pay, which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants, by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants. We anticipate positive net cash flow related to
IRC Section 45 activity in 2016. However, there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year. Therefore, accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is
not possible at this time. Nonetheless, if current ownership interests remain the same, if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remains as currently anticipated, and if we continue to generate sufficient
taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our IRC Section 45 investments, we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2016 through at least 2021. While we cannot accurately
forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period, we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall. Please see  Clean energy investments  on pages 56 and 57 for a more detailed
description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties.       Cash Flows From Financing Activities    
  On April 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment and restatement to our multicurrency credit agreement dated September 19, 2013 (which we refer to
as the Credit Agreement) with a group of fifteen financial institutions. The amendment and restatement, among other things, extended the expiration date of the Credit Agreement from September 19, 2018 to April 8, 2021 and increased
the revolving credit commitment from $600.0 million to $800.0 million, of which $75.0 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to $75.0 million may be used for the making of swing loans
(as defined in the Credit Agreement). We may from time to time request, subject to certain conditions, an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of
$1,100.0 million. At September 30, 2016, $258.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Due to borrowings and $21.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, $520.9 million remained
available under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016.     We use the Credit Agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to
supplement our operating cash flows from time to time. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we borrowed $1,619.5 million and repaid $1,556.5 million under our Credit Agreement. In the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015 we borrowed $534.0 million and repaid $521.0 million under the Credit Agreement. Principal uses of the 2016 and 2015 borrowings were to fund acquisitions, make earnout payments related to acquisitions and for
general corporate purposes.

   We have a secured revolving loan facility (which we refer to as the Premium Financing Debt Facility), that
provides funding for three Australian (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) premium finance subsidiaries. The Premium Financing Debt Facility is comprised of: (i) Facility B, which is separated into AU$150.0 million and NZ$35.0 million tranches,
(ii) Facility C, an AU$25.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche and (iii) Facility D, a NZ$15.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche. The Premium Financing Debt Facility expires May 18,
2017. At September 30, 2016, $133.1 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Premium Financing Debt Facility.     At
September 30, 2016, we had $2,400.0 million of  corporate-related  borrowings outstanding under separate note purchase agreements entered into in the period from 2007 to 2016 and a cash and cash
equivalent balance of $531.8 million. See Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements, the Credit Agreement and the Premium Financing Debt
Facility.     We completed a $275.0 million private placement debt transaction in the second quarter of 2016, with a weighted average
interest rate of 4.47%. In first quarter 2016, we entered into a pre-issuance interest rate hedging transaction related to the $175.0 million 10 year tranche of the $275.0 million private placement debt. We realized a cash gain
of approximately $1.0 million on the hedging transaction that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as a reduction in our reported interest expense over the ten year life of the debt.     We anticipate completing a $100.0 million, eleven year maturity, private placement debt transaction on or about December 1, 2016, with an interest rate of 3.46%. A portion of the proceeds
will be used to fund the $50.0 million of private placement debt that matures on November 30, 2016.      The note purchase agreements,
the Credit Agreement and the Premium Financing Debt Facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2016.  
   Dividends -  Our board of directors determines our dividend policy. Our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a
quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings, our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets.     In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we declared $204.0 million in cash dividends on our common stock, or $1.14 per common share, a 3% increase over the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015. On October 27, 2016, we announced a quarterly dividend for fourth quarter 2016 of $0.38 per common share.   This dividend level in 2016 will result in annualized net cash used by financing activities in
2016 of approximately $270.3 million (based on the number of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016) or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately $12.8 million compared to 2015. We make no assurances regarding
the amount of any future dividend payments.       Shelf Registration Statement -  On November 20, 2013, we filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our common stock. We have used this registration statement to register shares sold under our at-the-market equity program
referred to below. The availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. We make no assurances regarding when, or if, we will issue any
additional shares under this registration statement. On April 2, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, registering 8.0 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to
time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses, assets or securities. At September 30, 2016, 1.2 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.   
   At-the-Market Equity Program -  On November 20, 2013, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC,
pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $200 million (of which $15.6 million is remaining) of our common stock through Morgan Stanley as sales agent. Pursuant to the agreement, shares may be sold by
means of ordinary brokers  transactions, including on the New York Stock Exchange, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices, in block transactions, or as
otherwise agreed upon by us and Morgan Stanley. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we did not sell shares of our common stock under the program.      Common Stock Repurchases -  We have in place a common stock repurchase plan, last amended by our board of directors in 2008, for up to 10,000,000 shares. During the three-month period ended
September 30, 2016, we did not repurchase any shares under the plan (7.7 million shares remain available). During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock at a
cost of $101.0 million. The plan   
         - 60 -

Table of Contents  

authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous, in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We are under
no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares, and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, short-term
or long-term borrowings under our Credit Agreement or other sources. See  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  below for more information regarding shares repurchased during the quarter.   
   Common Stock Issuances -  Another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock
purchase plans. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $36.8 million and $49.8 million, respectively. On May 13, 2014, our
stockholders approved the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the LTIP), which replaced our previous stockholder-approved 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan. All of our officers, employees and non-employee directors are eligible to
receive awards under the LTIP. Awards which may be granted under the LTIP include non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance units, any or all of which may be made contingent
upon the achievement of performance criteria. Stock options with respect to 4.4 million shares (less any shares of restricted stock issued under the LTIP - 1.0 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of
September 30, 2016) were available for grant under the LTIP at September 30, 2016. Our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95% of its fair market value. Proceeds from the issuance of
our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable
future.      Outlook -  We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short- and long-term cash flow needs. Except for 2008 and
2005, our earnings before income taxes, adjusted for  non-cash  items, have increased year over year since 1991. In 2008, earnings before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real
estate lease terminations, severance, litigation, impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation. In 2005, earnings before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and
retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations. We expect the historically favorable trend in earnings before income taxes, adjusted for  non-cash  items, to continue in the
foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions. Additionally, we anticipate a favorable impact on the amount we will pay the IRS in 2016 through
at least 2021 based on anticipated tax credits from IRC Section 45 investments. We also anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and, if needed, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and private placement debt
(described above under  Cash Flows From Financing Activities ) and our common stock to fund acquisitions. In addition, we may from time to time consider other alternatives for longer-term funding sources. Such alternatives could
include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings, equity markets, or restructuring our operations. See  Litigation and Regulatory Matters  under  Results of Operations - Brokerage  above for information
regarding an investigation by the IRS into our micro-captive advisory services, as well as certain matters relating to our operations in the U.K., which could impact our liquidity depending on how such matters are resolved.   
   Contractual Obligations and Commitments    
  In connection with our investing and operating activities, we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments. See Note 13 to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these obligations and commitments. In addition, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       See Notes 6, 12 and 13 to the unaudited consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of our  off-balance  sheet arrangements. In addition, see Notes 7, 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional discussion of these off-balance sheet arrangements.       Critical Accounting Policies       There have been no changes in our critical accounting
policies, which include revenue recognition, income taxes and intangible assets/earnout obligations, as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       We are exposed to various market risks in our day to day
operations. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. The following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair
value of the financial instruments held by us at September 30, 2016 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over
a  one-year  period. This discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks. The effect of actual
changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates. In the ordinary course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable, including credit risk and legal risk. These risks are not
included in the following analyses.      Our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents, which are subject to various market
risk exposures such as interest rate risk. The fair value of our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 approximated its carrying value due to its short-term duration. We estimated market risk as the potential
decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical  one-percentage  point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio. The resulting fair
values were not materially different from the carrying values at September 30, 2016.      At September 30, 2016, we had
$2,400.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements. The aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at September 30, 2016 was $2,590.8 million due to their
 long-term  duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations. No active or observable market exists for our private placement long-term debt. Therefore, the estimated fair value of
this debt is based on the income valuation approach, which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount. The fair value measurement is
determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. Because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender, the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology
for valuing the private placement long-term debt. The methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance, which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance (the coupon rate) and the
equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time. The market spread as of the valuation date was calculated, which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield
today. An implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated. The index we relied on to represent
investment graded insurers was the Bloomberg Valuation Services (BVAL) U.S. Insurers BBB index. This index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate. For the purposes of
this analysis, the average BBB rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us based on our current estimated credit rating.     We
estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical  one-percentage  point decrease in our weighted average borrowing
rate at September 30, 2016 and the resulting fair values would have been $341.9 million higher than their carrying value (or $2,741.9 million). We estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in
our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical  one-percentage  point increase in our weighted average borrowing rate at September 30, 2016 and the resulting fair values would have been
$51.2 million higher than their carrying value (or $2,451.2 million).      As of September 30, 2016, we had $258.0 million of
borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. The fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short-term duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations. Market risk is estimated
as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical  one-percentage  point decrease in our weighted average short-term borrowing rate at September 30, 2016, and the resulting fair value is
not materially different from their carrying value.      At September 30, 2016, we had $133.1 million of borrowings outstanding under
our Premium Financing Debt Facility. The fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short-term duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations. Market risk is estimated as the
potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical  one-percentage  point decrease in our weighted average short-term borrowing rate at September 30, 2016, and the resulting fair value is not
materially different from their carrying value.

   We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger U.K. based brokerage
subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in British pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in U.S. dollars. Please see Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for additional information regarding potential
foreign exchange rate risks arising from Brexit. In addition, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our Australian, Canadian, Indian, Jamaican, New Zealand, Norwegian, Singaporean and various Caribbean and South American
operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies. Foreign currency gains (losses) related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of
10% in the average foreign currency exchange rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately $0.7 million. Assuming a
hypothetical favorable change of 10% in the average foreign currency exchange rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately
$4.8 million. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. We manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries, where
practical, such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets, maintaining a  balanced book  which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations. However, our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign
currency exchange risk related to intra-entity loans between our U.S. based subsidiaries and our non-U.S. based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency. A transaction that is in a foreign currency is first
remeasured at the entity s functional (local) currency, where applicable, (which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings) and then translated to the reporting (U.S. dollar) currency (which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders 
equity) for consolidated reporting purposes. If the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity s functional currency, only the translation to U.S. dollar reporting is necessary. The remeasurement process required by U.S.
GAAP for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss, which could be material, that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss).   
  Historically, we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, with respect to
managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in India, Norway and the U.K., we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk. During the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had several monthly put/call options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future U.K. currency revenues (in 2016) and disbursements (in 2015)
through various future payment dates. In addition, during the  nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had several monthly put/call options in place with an external financial
institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our Indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates. Although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant U.K. and India currency
exchange rate movements, we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged. All of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with ASC 815,
 Derivatives and Hedging , and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance. In the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test, the hedge will be
 re-measured  at the stated point and the appropriate loss, if applicable, would be recognized. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 there has been no such effect on our financial presentation.
The impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. See Note 14 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements
for the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings at September 
30, 2016.         Item 4. Controls and Procedures       As of September 30, 2016, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in  Rule 13a-15(e)  of the Exchange Act, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.      There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

     Item 1. Legal Proceedings       Please see the information set forth in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, included herein, under  Litigation, Regulatory and Taxation Matters.    
     Item 1A. Risk Factors       The risk factors described under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended

Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds        (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities    
  The following table shows the purchases of our common stock made by or on behalf of us or any  affiliated purchaser  (as such term is defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Gallagher for each fiscal month in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016:

  Amounts in this column include shares of our common stock purchased by the trustees of rabbi trusts established under our Deferred Equity Participation Plan, including
sub-plans (which we refer to as the DEPP), our Deferred Cash Participation Plan (which we refer to as the DCPP) and our Supplemental Savings and Thrift Plan (which we refer to as the Supplemental Plan), respectively. The DEPP is an unfunded,
non-qualified deferred compensation plan that generally provides for distributions to certain of our key executives when they reach age 62 or upon or after their actual retirement. Under sub-plans of the DEPP for certain production staff, the plan
generally provides for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards, although certain awards vest and/or distribute after the earlier of fifteen years or the participant reaching age 65. See Note 9 to the
unaudited consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding the DEPP. The DCPP is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees, other than executive officers, that generally provides
for vesting and/or distributions no sooner than five years from the date of awards. Under the terms of the DEPP and the DCPP, we may contribute cash to the rabbi trust and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares of our
common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In the third quarter of 2016, we instructed the rabbi trustee for the DEPP and the DCPP to reinvest dividends paid into the plans in our common stock and to purchase our common
stock using the cash that was funded into these plans related to the 2016 awards under the DEPP sub-plans. The Supplemental Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows certain highly compensated employees to defer
amounts, including company match amounts, on a before-tax or  after-tax  basis. Under the terms of the Supplemental Plan, all cash deferrals and company match amounts may be deemed invested, at the
employee s election, in a number of investment options that include various mutual funds, an annuity product and a fund representing our common stock. When an employee elects to deem his or her amounts under the Supplemental Plan invested
in the fund representing our common stock, the trustee of the rabbi trust purchases the number of shares of our common stock equivalent to the amount deemed invested in the fund representing our common stock. We established the rabbi trusts for
the DEPP, the DCPP and the Supplemental Plan to assist us in discharging our deferred compensation obligations under these plans. All assets of the rabbi trusts, including any shares of our common stock purchased by the trustees, remain, at all
times, assets of the Company, subject to the claims of our creditors. The terms of the DEPP, the DCPP and the Supplemental Plan do not provide for a specified limit on the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by the respective
trustees of the rabbi trusts.

  We have a common stock repurchase plan that the board of directors adopted on May 10, 1988 and has periodically amended since that date to authorize additional
shares for repurchase (the last amendment was on January 24, 2008 and approved the repurchase of 10,000,000 shares). The repurchase plan has no expiration date and we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular
amount of our common stock under the plan. 
At our discretion, we may suspend the repurchase plan at any time.           Item 5. Other Information
       Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act       In third quarter 2016, our U.K. domiciled subsidiary, Arthur J. Gallagher (UK) Limited (AJGUK) acted as insurance broker and advised clients in obtaining insurance coverage for activities related to
Iran s oil, gas and petroleum industries. AJGUK assisted clients in obtaining insurance coverage for a variety of activities in Iran, including insurance coverage for:   

the supply of crude oil to and from Iran;          

the transport and storage of oil from Iran;          

the shipment of heavy fuel oil to and from Iran;          

the docking and loading of oil shipments in Iran; and      

the operation of vessels providing support services to offshore oil platforms that supply oil to Iran.      
  On January 16, 2016, the U.S. lifted the nuclear-related  secondary sanctions  imposed against Iran. In connection with this event, the
U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License H, which authorizes U.S.-owned or U.S.-controlled foreign entities to engage in certain transactions involving Iran that would otherwise be prohibited by
section 560.215 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations.      The activities described above were conducted in full compliance with
General License H. AJGUK generated total gross revenue of approximately  1,105 (approximately $1,437) and net profit of approximately  189 (approximately $246) from these activities.  
  AJGUK intends to continue acting as an insurance broker in connection with insurance coverages authorized by General License H.
