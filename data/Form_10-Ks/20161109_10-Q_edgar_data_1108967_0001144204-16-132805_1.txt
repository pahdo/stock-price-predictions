1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Nature of Operations  

 CUI Global Inc. and subsidiaries,
(collectively,  CUI Global  or  the Company ) is a platform company composed of two segments: Power and Electromechanical
segment and Energy segment, along with an  Other  category. 

The Power and Electromechanical
segment is comprised of the following wholly owned subsidiaries of CUI Global Inc.: CUI, Inc. (CUI), based in Tualatin, Oregon;
CUI Japan, based in Tokyo, Japan; CUI-Canada, based in Toronto, Canada, and the administrative entity, CUI Properties. All
three subsidiaries are providers of power and electromechanical components including power supplies, transformers,
converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 

The Power and Electromechanical segment
defines its product offerings into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices,
and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions, which includes Novum. These offerings provide a technology
architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as consumer electronics, medical and
defense. 

The Energy segment is made up of the
following wholly-owned subsidiaries of CUI Global Inc.: Orbital Gas Systems Limited (Orbital) based in Staffordshire, United
Kingdom and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. based in Houston, Texas. The Energy segment provides natural gas
infrastructure and advanced technology, including metering, odorization, remote telemetry units
(  RTU  ) and a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power
generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries. 

The Other category represents the remaining
activities that are not included as part of the other reportable segments and primarily represents corporate activity. 

Basis of Presentation  

  The accompanying interim unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial
information, which includes condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and
notes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction
with the Company's Annual Report, Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

It is management's opinion that all material
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results for the interim period are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassifications  

 Certain amounts from the prior periods
have been reclassified to the current period presentation included on the condensed consolidated statements of operations: for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $41 thousand and $90 thousand, respectively, of depreciation and amortization
was reclassified to cost of revenues from SG A. On the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, a cash in-flow of $237 thousand was reclassified from accrued expenses to stock and options issued and
to be issued for compensation, royalties and services for accrued stock compensation. Also, purchases of property and equipment
were decreased by $88 thousand and investments in other intangibles were increased by $1 thousand with the offsetting $87 thousand
use of cash reclassified to increase (decrease) in accounts payable in operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

8   

Revisions  

 The following immaterial revisions made
to prior financial statements were related to sales of raw material components to a vendor that in turn, sold finished goods inventory
to the Company that included the raw material components that we had sold to the vendor. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, total revenues and cost of revenues were both decreased by $83 thousand and $399 thousand, respectively, which is the amount
of sales of raw material components to the vendor. In addition, at December 31, 2015, $246 thousand was reclassified from
prepaid expenses to raw materials inventory related to inventory sold to the vendor that had not yet been processed by the vendor.
On the cash flow, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $274 thousand was reclassified from a use of cash for an increase
in prepaid expenses to a use of cash for an increase in inventory. These revisions had no effect on gross profit, operating and
net loss or net cash flows used in operating activities. 

2. INVENTORY  

Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process
and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or through the moving
average cost method. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued liabilities included $0.8 million and $1.7
million, respectively, of accrued inventory payable. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory by category
is valued net of reserves and consists of: 

(1)   At December 31, 2015, CUI-Canada inventory reserves
of $97 thousand were reclassified from raw materials to inventory reserves and $246 thousand of prepaid expenses at CUI Inc. were
reclassified to raw materials inventory. 

3. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED
INTANGIBLES  

The Company
tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis
of goodwill and a qualitative analysis of its indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2016, and determined there was no impairment
of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles. Under the quantitative analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its
carrying amount by at least 5%. 

9   

As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing
its testing for impairment of goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than
not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Periodically, as was done at
May 31, 2016, the Company also prepares a quantitative analysis in addition to the qualitative one. To complete the qualitative
review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the goodwill and considers all known events
and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no
events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion
of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year). 

The carrying
value of goodwill and the activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

The Company also tests for impairment of
other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the second quarter of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the intangible assets exceed their fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company performed a qualitative
assessment of impairment for other indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2016 following the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and
18B and determined there to be no impairment. Other Indefinite-lived intangibles were $7.3 million at September 30, 2016. 

4. INVESTMENT
AND NOTE RECEIVABLE  

Prior to September
30, 2015, CUI Global had an 8.5% ownership investment in Test Products International, Inc. ( TPI ) that was recognized
via the equity method of accounting. For more details on this investment see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting policies
to CUI Global's financial statements filed in Item 8 of the Company's latest Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016. 

Subsequent to
September 30, 2015, CUI Global and its common related parties were unable to obtain a timely financial report, which was inconsistent
with prior periods, evidencing a reduction in the influence of CUI Global over TPI. Based on this change in influence, and CUI
Global s level of technical control through its 8.5% equity interest, management determined that effective with the quarter
ended December 31, 2015 that CUI Global no longer had significant influence over TPI. Accordingly, the Company's investment in
TPI was accounted for under the cost method in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment
in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest
at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019. The Company recorded $5 thousand of interest income from the note in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and $15 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly
basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales. Any remaining finders-fee royalties
balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly. CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of September 30,
2016 and concluded that no allowance was necessary.

Presented below
are the equity method earnings through nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the period that CUI Global had significant influence
over TPI:

     Operating income    
     $  674

Comprehensive net profit    
     $  621     
 
     Company share of net profit    
     $  53     

5. DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS  

The Company
uses various derivative instruments including forward currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage certain exposures.
These instruments are entered into under the Company s corporate risk management policy to minimize exposure and are not
for speculative trading purposes. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings.
For additional information on fair value of derivatives, see Note 9,  Investments and Fair Value Measurements,  of
these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has limited involvement with derivative instruments and does not
trade them. The Company has entered into one interest rate swap, which has a maturity date of ten years from the date of inception,
and is used to minimize the interest rate risk on the variable rate mortgage. During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had $47 thousand of unrealized gain and $98 thousand of unrealized loss, respectively related to the derivative
liabilities. 

Embedded Derivative Liabilities  

 The Company
evaluates embedded conversion features pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 815 ( FASB ASC 815 ),
 Derivatives and Hedging,  which requires a periodic valuation of the fair value of derivative instruments and a corresponding
recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives. 

6. STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS FOR COMPENSATION,
SERVICES AND ROYALTIES  

The Company
records its stock-based compensation expense under its stock option plans and the Company also issues stock for services and royalties.
A detailed description of the awards under these plans and the respective accounting treatment is included in the  Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements  included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. The Company did not grant any stock options in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded stock-based expense of $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively,
and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded stock-based expense of $0.3 million and $1.0
million, respectively. In addition, prepaid expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included stock-based
payments related to prepaid services of $0 and $31 thousand, respectively. 

7. SEGMENT
REPORTING  

Operating segments
are defined in accordance with ASC 280-10 as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available
that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing performance. 

Management has
identified six operating segments based on the activities of the Company in accordance with ASC 280-10. These operating segments
have been aggregated into two reportable segments and an  Other  category. The two reportable segments are Power and
Electromechanical, and Energy. The Power and Electromechanical segment is focused on the operations of CUI, Inc., CUI-Canada and
CUI Japan for the sale of internal and external power supplies and related components and industrial controls. The Energy segment
is focused on the operations of Orbital Gas Systems Limited and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which includes gas related
metering, monitoring and control systems, including the GasPT, VE Probe and IRIS. The Other category represents the remaining activities
that are not included as part of the other reportable segments and primarily represents corporate activity. 

11   

During the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company s total revenues consisted of 69% from the Power
and Electromechanical segment and 31% from the Energy segment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, the Company's total revenues consisted of 67% from the Power and Electromechanical segment and 33% from the Energy segment.

8. RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 clarifies whether eight specifically identified cash flow issues
should be categorized as operating, investing or financing activities in the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective
for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The Company is currently assessing
the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide financial statement users with more useful information about expected
credit losses on financial assets held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The new standard replaces the existing incurred
loss impairment methodology with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable forward-looking
information to estimate all expected credit losses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years
beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning
after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ).
This update was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits
and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy
election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity
classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter
of 2017. This guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition
method, depending on the area covered in this update. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet selected a transition date
nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. 

In February 2016, The FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  (  ASU 2016-02  ). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities (with the exception of short-term leases) on the balance sheet. The new guidance will be effective
for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within that fiscal year.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the Company s pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated
financial statements and will adopt the standard in 2019. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ) that requires entities to measure inventory
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course
of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance
must be applied on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on
our financial statements and we have not elected to early adopt. 

14   

In May 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle
of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process
to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process
than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard was originally effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting
the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a
retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes
additional note disclosures). On July 9, 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard
for public entities by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods beginning in
the first interim period within the year of adoption. Early application is permitted, but not before the original effective date
for public entities, annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016, and interim periods beginning in the first interim period
within the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Company s pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the
Company s consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which the Company will adopt the standard
in 2018. 

9. INVESTMENTS
AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The Company s fair value hierarchy
for its cash equivalents, marketable securities and derivative instruments, including contingent consideration, as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, was as follows: 

15   

Level 3 instruments are made up of contingent
consideration that was incurred as part of the Tectrol, Inc. acquisition in March 2015. The contingent consideration liability
represents the present value of the contingent payment based on the related projected revenues. The inputs used to measure contingent
consideration are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, which are not observable in the market and reflects the
Company s own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liability. Changes in the fair
value of the contingent consideration obligation excluding changes due to payments are reflected in the statement of operations
in selling, general and administrative expenses during the period the valuation change occurs. Contingent consideration in the
amount of $59 thousand was paid out during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the remaining liability for contingent consideration
was revalued as of September 30, 2016 based on an updated forecast of the related revenues. 

10. ACQUISITION  

CUI-Canada,
Inc. 

 On March 5,
2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc.,
a Toronto, Canada corporation. The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company s
Power and Electromechanical segment. As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate
subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities. That entity entered into a five-year lease of the
Toronto facility where Tectrol, Inc. was operating its business. CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design, manufacture assembly
and sales of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and
uninterruptable power supplies. 

The purchase
price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final
value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments. In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty
payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date,
up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year end, depending on
performance by the identified customer(s). The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which
includes the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent
consideration. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company paid $59 thousand of contingent consideration. At September 30,
2016, $72 thousand of contingent consideration is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and the remaining $78 thousand
is included in other long-term liabilities. For additional details on the contingent consideration, see Note 9,  Investments
and Fair Value Measurements,  of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The full purchase price less the contingent
consideration was paid in cash. The Company funded the consideration paid to the shareholder of Tectrol with existing cash and
cash equivalents and funds from short-term investments that had matured. 

The acquisition
was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. 

16   

The table below
summarizes the unaudited condensed pro forma information of the results of operations of the Company, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 as though the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2014: 

(1)   Adjustment to recognize the estimated depreciation and amortization expense for the presented period
assuming amortization of the intangible assets and depreciation of tangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Estimated
depreciation and amortization for the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations are $31 thousand for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations reflect only pro forma
adjustments expected to have a continuing effect on the consolidated results beyond 12 months from the consummation of the acquisition.
Excluded from the pro forma adjustment is the effect of the write up of inventory recorded as a result of acquisition accounting
of $0.1 million.   

The above unaudited
condensed pro forma information does not purport to represent what the Companies  combined results of operations would have
been if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the period as of January 1, 2014, and are not indicative of future results. 

11. LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  

In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 260 ( FASB ASC 260 ),  Earnings per Share,  basic net income (loss) per share is computed
by dividing the net income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period calculated using the treasury stock
method. Due to the Company s net loss in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method would have had an antidilutive effect and therefore 1.0 million
shares related to stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for both the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Accordingly, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

17   

12. CAPITALIZED INTEREST  

The cost of constructing facilities, equipment
and project assets includes interest costs incurred during the assets  construction period. The components of interest expense
and capitalized interest are as follows: 

13. INCOME TAXES  

The Company
is subject to taxation in the U.S., as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company continues to record a full
valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the Company
will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will
be recognized when management concludes realization of such amounts is more likely than not. 

A net tax benefit of $191 thousand and
a net tax expense of $82 thousand was recorded to the income tax provision for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.4% and (1.8)%, respectively, for the periods. The income tax benefit
for the quarter primarily relates to benefits in foreign jurisdictions and the year-to-date relates primarily to taxes on the Company's
profitable foreign operations and domestic state minimum taxes. The Company s total income tax benefit and effective tax
rate was $188 thousand and $421 thousand and 76.1% and 8.3%, respectively, for the same periods in 2015. The income tax benefit
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 related primarily to deferred taxes at our foreign operations partially offset
by domestic state minimum taxes as all of our USA deferred tax assets were reduced by a full valuation allowance. 

14. WORKING CAPITAL LINE OF CREDIT  

During the period
ended September 30, 2016, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc., maintained a two-year revolving Line of

The following summarizes the current and
long-term portion of capital leases as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

17. NOTES PAYABLE  

Notes payable is summarized as follows
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1)   On October 1, 2013, the funding of the purchase of the Company s Tualatin, Oregon corporate
offices from Barakel, LLC was completed. The purchase price for this asset was $5.1 million. The purchase was funded, in part,
by a promissory note payable to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $3.7 million plus interest at the rate of 2% above LIBOR, payable
over ten years with a balloon payment due at maturity. It was secured by a deed of trust on the purchased property which was executed
by CUI Properties, LLC and guaranteed by CUI Global, Inc. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made principal
payments of $64 thousand against the mortgage promissory note payable. At September 30, 2016, the balance owed on the mortgage
promissory note payable was $3.5 million, of which $88 thousand and $3.4 million were in current and long-term liabilities, respectively.   

(2)   The note payable to International Electronic Devices, Inc. (formerly CUI, Inc.) is associated with
the acquisition of CUI, Inc. The promissory note is due May 15, 2020 and includes a 5% interest rate per annum, with interest payable
monthly and the principal due as a balloon payment at maturity. The note contains a contingent conversion feature, such that in
the event of default on the note the holder of the note can, at the holder s option, convert the note principal into common
stock at $0.001 per share. As of September 30, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all terms of this promissory note and
the conversion feature is not effective.   

18. CONCENTRATIONS  

During the third quarter of 2016, 19% of
revenues were derived from one customer: Digi-Key Electronics at 19% in the Power and Electromechanical segment. Similarly, during

Overview  

CUI Global is a platform company dedicated
to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. Through
its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, CUI Global had a consolidated loss from operations of $0.6 million compared to consolidated income from operations of
$0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, CUI Global had a consolidated
net loss of $0.5 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $59 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
consolidated net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily the result of selling, general and administrative
expenses related to Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and manufacturing costs at CUI-Canada, Inc., as well as increased
audit and accounting fees in the other category, the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital Gas Systems
Limited and CUI-Canada acquisitions and lower gross profit margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment. A lower value of
the British pound Sterling due to the recent Brexit vote resulted in lower translated revenue at our U.K. operations, but did not
have a significant effect on operating or net income. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, CUI Global had a consolidated loss from operations of $3.9 million compared to a consolidated loss from operations of $4.6
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, CUI Global had
a consolidated net loss of $4.7 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $4.6 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The consolidated net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily the result of selling, general
and administrative expenses related to Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and manufacturing costs at CUI-Canada, Inc., as
well as severance costs in both the Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments, increased audit and accounting fees in the
other category and the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital Gas Systems Limited and CUI-Canada acquisitions.
The overall results in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015
showed improved results in the Energy segment, which were partially offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical
segment, and higher taxes in our foreign operations. Energy segment operations were improved despite headwinds from lower translated
British pound results due to Brexit. These results are compared to the first nine months of 2015, which were negatively affected
by the downward pressure on income in the first nine months of 2015 from start-up costs associated with Orbital Gas Systems, North
America and CUI-Canada.

Results of Operations  

The following tables set forth, for the period indicated, certain
financial information regarding revenue and costs by segment.

Revenue  

(dollars in thousands) 

(dollars in thousands) 

25   

The revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were lower than the comparable period due primarily to lower translated revenue at our U.K. operations. Overall,
revenues are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the addition
in March 2015 of CUI-Canada related product line, the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems,
North America, Inc, and overall improved sales of gas related metering, monitoring and control systems, including GasPT. Revenue
in the Power and Electromechanical segment was down $0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the timing
of customer delivery schedules and sell through activity at distributors. 

The customer orders related to the Power
and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued
sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, distribution channel sales, and the addition in March 2015 of the products
from CUI-Canada. 

The Power and Electromechanical segment
and Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.2 million and $13.4 million, respectively, as of September 30,
2016. 

Cost of revenues  

(dollars in thousands) 

(dollars in thousands) 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 63% from 62% during the prior-year comparative period. This
percentage will vary based upon the power and electromechanical product mix sold, the mix of natural gas systems sold, contract
labor necessary to complete gas related projects, the competitive markets in which the Company competes, and foreign exchange rates. 

The cost of revenues as a percentage of
revenue for the Power and Electromechanical segment for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was 65% compared to
61% during the prior-year comparative period. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the Energy segment for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was 60% compared to 65% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The improved cost percentage
in the Energy segment was due to an improved product mix during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015. 

26   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue decreased to 62% from 63% during the prior-year comparative period. This
improvement was due to an improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment.
As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cost of revenues
as a percentage of revenue dropped 9 percentage points from 65% to 56%. This improvement helped to offset lower margins incurred
in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment's cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 64%
from 62%. 

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses  

(dollars in thousands) 

(dollars in thousands) 

Selling, General and Administrative (SG A)
expenses include such items as wages, commissions, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of
being a public company, including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, SG A increased $0.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, compared to the prior-year comparative periods.
The increase for the nine-month period is largely due to $0.8 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical
segment for the transition of the R D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Increased audit and accounting fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $0.2
million and $0.8 million, respectively, included in the Other category contributed to the increased SG A in both the three
and nine-month periods. Partially offsetting the increased SG A for the nine-month period was a $0.6 million decrease in non-severance-related
SG A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased
start-up related costs in its first three months of operations. The remaining increases in SG A during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including
Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions. SG A increased to 35% of total revenue compared to 32% of total
revenue during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
the percent of SG A increased to 39% of total revenue compared to 38% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.

Depreciation and Amortization  

The depreciation and amortization expenses
are associated with depreciation on buildings, furniture, equipment, vehicles, and intangible assets over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. 

(dollars in thousands) 

(dollars in thousands) 

The total depreciation and amortization
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included $125 thousand and $93 thousand, respectively, which was
included in cost of revenues. The total depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 included $338 thousand and $252 thousand, respectively, which were included in cost of revenues. The increase in depreciation
and amortization included in cost of sales was due to increased allocation of depreciation and amortization to cost of revenues
at CUI-Canada. 

Depreciation and amortization expense in
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was down slightly compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of
lower translated depreciation and amortization at our U.K. facilities due to lower pound Sterling translation rates in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from Brexit in June 2016. Partially
offsetting this decrease were depreciation and amortization increases due to new additions to property and equipment and intangibles
during the second half of 2015 and first nine months of 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization decreased
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 as the intangible asset associated
with the order backlog acquired with Orbital Gas Systems Limited was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015. The increase
in depreciation at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to the purchase of CUI-Canada in March 2015, which meant that
2016 had two more months of CUI-Canada depreciation than in the first nine months of 2015.

Provision for Bad Debt  

 The decrease in bad debt is due to improved
credit and collections across all businesses in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income (expense) consisted of the

Interest Expense  

For both the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, of $0.1 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company incurred interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, of $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million
in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to lower capitalized interest in the 2016 nine-month period. 

Interest expense in 2016 and 2015 is associated
with interest on bank and secured promissory notes. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)  

The Company is subject to taxation in the
U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to record a full valuation allowance against the Company s U.S.
net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future
period. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management concludes realization
of such amounts is more likely than not. 

For additional analysis, see Note 13,  Income
Taxes,  of the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I - Item I,  Financial Statements.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

General  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
held Cash and cash equivalents of $7.1 million. Operations, acquisitions, investments, patents, equipment, land and buildings have
been funded through cash on hand and debt for CUI Properties. 

Cash Provided by (Used In) Operations  

Cash flow from operations of $1.1 million
was a $8.4 million improvement from $7.3 million of negative cash flow in the comparable period in 2015. The nine months ended
September 30, 2015 were significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI-Canada,
which were both in their first year of operations under CUI Global. 

The change in cash used in operating activities
is primarily the result of lower new working capital requirements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 and positive cash flows due to cash generation from the collection of trade accounts receivable
of $2.2 million and billings in excess of costs of $0.9 million compared to a $4.8 million use of cash in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 from the build-up of trade accounts receivable, a $2.5 million use of cash from a change in inventory, a $1.1
million use of cash due to the change in billings in excess of costs and $1.4 million on prepaids offset by $1.9 million provided
by the change in unearned revenue. 

31   

During the first nine months of 2016 and
2015, the Company used stock as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants and employees. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a total of $1.0 million for both years for share-based compensation related to equity given,
or to be given and for options vesting, to employees and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned. 

As the Company focuses on technology development,
product line additions, developing CUI-Canada operations, and developing Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. during the remainder
of 2016 and beyond, it will continue to fund research and development together with related sales and marketing efforts for its
various product offerings with cash on hand. 

Capital Expenditures and Investments  

During the first nine months of 2016 and
2015, CUI Global invested $0.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in property and equipment. These investments typically include
additions to equipment, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, regular computer equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements
and other fixed assets as needed for operations. The Company anticipates further investment in property and equipment in the remaining
quarter of 2016 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, CUI Global invested $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in other intangible assets. These investments
typically include product certifications, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development
and software upgrades for office personnel. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 the Company did not invest in any new short-term investments classified as held to maturity and did not receive any cash
from the maturities of these investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not invest in short-term
investments classified as held to maturity and received $10.6 million from maturities of these investments. These investments included
money market securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes. Investments made by the Company are subject
to an investment policy, which limits the Company s risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements
for investments held, limiting maturities to be 1 year or less, and also setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations.
This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $0.5 million, whichever is greater, may be invested in one
particular issue. 

In the first nine months of 2016 the Company
generated $22 thousand from the sale of property and equipment. 

Effective March 1, 2015, CUI Global closed
on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation
(now CUI-Canada). For additional details of this acquisition, see Note 10,  Acquisition,  of the condensed consolidated
financial statements in Part I Item I,  Financial Statements.  

Financing Activities  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company made payments of $38 thousand and $26 thousand, respectively, toward capital lease obligations; $64
thousand and $60 thousand, respectively, toward the mortgage note payable; and $59 thousand and $0, respectively, toward the contingent
liability related to the Tectrol, Inc. acquisition. 

CUI Global may raise additional capital
needed to fund the further development and marketing of its products as well as payment of its debt obligations. 

Financing activities   related
party activity  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, $0.2 million of interest payments were made in each nine-month period in relation to the promissory notes issued
to related party, IED, Inc. 

32   

Recap of Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Wells Fargo mortgage promissory note
has a balance at September 30, 2016 of $3.5 million due, of which $88 thousand is the current portion. As of the date of this
filing, the Company is compliant with all covenants on the promissory note with Wells Fargo Bank. Additionally, at September 30,
2016, the Company had a zero balance on its $4.0 million two-year revolving Line of Credit (LOC) with Wells Fargo Bank, which was
subsequently extended to October 1, 2018. As of the date of this filing, the Company is compliant with all covenants on the line
of credit with Wells Fargo Bank. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company
had cash and cash equivalents balances of $7.1 million. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $0.6 million of cash and cash
equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions, which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million
at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit
Insurance Corporation (CDIC). The money market balance of $16 thousand is covered under the SIPC insured program for investments
up to a maximum of $500,000. At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $0.2 million in Japanese
bank accounts, $2.2 million in European bank accounts and $93 thousand in Canadian bank accounts. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company
has capital lease obligations of $44 thousand, of which $31 thousand are current obligations. 

As described in Item 1A - Risk factors,
the United Kingdom's proposed withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results
but the extent of the effect, if any, is not yet determinable. See Item 1A - Risk factors, for more information on the potential
risks that are associated with the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union. 

The Company believes its operations and
existing financing structure, including cash and cash equivalents and the unused line of credit, will provide sufficient cash to
meet its short-term working capital requirements for the next twelve months. The Company renewed its line of credit, on October
1, 2016 for an additional two years. The Company believes the operating requirements necessary to further support Orbital Gas Systems,
North America, Inc. and CUI-Canada in the remaining quarter of 2016 will be reduced compared with the same period of 2015. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our financial statements and related public
financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an
impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. Significant estimates include estimates used to review
the Company s goodwill, impairment and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion
type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, valuation of non-cash capital stock
issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained
in the Company s external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe
the Company s use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively
applied. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of the Company s financial statements. 

33   

While all of the Company s significant
accounting policies impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations, we view the following policies as
critical: 

Asset impairments   

Identifiable intangibles and goodwill   

Percentage of completion   

Revenue recognition   

Stock based compensation   

Valuation of noncash capital stock issuances   

Income taxes   

Policies determined to be critical are
those policies that have the most significant impact on the Company s financial statements and require management to use
a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The Company s management believes
that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies
would cause a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented
in this report. A description of our critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates that affect the preparation
of our condensed consolidated financial statements is set forth in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

See Note 8 of the condensed consolidated
financial statements in Part I Item I,  Financial Statements  for a description of recent accounting pronouncements,
including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure about Market Risk  

The Company is exposed to market risk in
the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the Company s financial position
due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. This market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. 

The following sections provide quantitative
information on the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses
that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  

 The Company conducts operations in four
principal currencies: the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. These currencies operate
primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., U.K., Canadian and Japanese operations, respectively. Cash is
managed centrally within each of the four regions. 

34   

Because of fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. Foreign currency translation risk
is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities  statements of earnings and balance
sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, for consolidation purposes. As currency
exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the Company s statements of operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability
of revenues and operating expenses between years. 

Revenues and operating expenses are primarily
denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the Company s operations are located, the U.S., U.K., Canada and
Japan. The Company s consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 

The table below details the percentage
of revenues and expenses by the four principal currencies for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)   On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an asset purchase
agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc. which was effective March 1, 2015. 

To date, the Company has not entered into
any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts
or other similar derivative instruments. We believe that during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effect
of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the Company s business would not
have had a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

35   

Investment Risk  

The Company has an Investment Policy that,
among other things, provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate
risk), liquidity and yield. The Company s investment officers, CEO and CFO, oversee the investment portfolio and compile
a quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio. 

Cash and cash equivalents are diversified
and maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit,
therefore, bear minimal credit risk. 

The Company has trade receivable and revenues
concentrations with large customers. Additionally, the Company has a large concentration of cash, trade receivables and revenues
in foreign countries including the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

The Company's management, with the participation
of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and its Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered
by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Company s management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's management, including
the CEO and the CFO, concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules
and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company included in its assessment of internal controls, an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting
of CUI-Canada, Inc., which is the subsidiary corporation that was set up to hold the assets and certain liabilities acquired effective
March 1, 2015 from Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management s
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 had excluded an assessment of internal control
over financial reporting of CUI-Canada, Inc. 

During the quarter ended March 31,
2016, the Company successfully remediated the material weakness related to income taxes that was outstanding as of December 31,
2015 and as of September 30, 2016, has successfully remediated the material weakness related to revenue recognition that was outstanding
as of December 31, 2015. 

36   

Material Weaknesses: 

Revenue Recognition 

1.         The
Company had previously implemented a control at our subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems Limited, in the fourth quarter of 2014 that
was designed to ensure all contracts outside of standard terms and conditions were being reviewed by qualified personnel for proper
revenue recognition treatment under US GAAP, however, contracts prior to the implementation were not covered by this control. Accordingly,
we concluded that this represented a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Management implemented controls to remediate this material weakness; however,
the design and operating effectiveness of the controls were determined to be deficient.  

2.         The
Company s extensive use of spreadsheets to track job orders that were accounted for under percentage of completion became
cumbersome and more error prone due to the growth in the number of jobs in the Energy Segment. During the audit of the Company s
financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, a number of errors were identified in the calculation of revenue
under the percentage of completion method. These errors were the result of insufficient detailed management review and lack of
process controls and training for the individuals entering the contract details into the spreadsheets as to the proper accounting
for the percentage of completion revenue recognition method.  

Therefore, we determined that as of December 31, 2015,
the combined control deficiencies as described above constituted a material weakness over our revenue recognized on a percentage
of completion basis. 

Income Taxes 

During the year-end audit of our financial statements, it was
determined that our provision for foreign income taxes was understated due to calculation errors. We concluded that this understatement
was a result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of certain controls surrounding
the calculation of our foreign income tax provision. 

The principal factors that contributed to the material weakness
related to our foreign tax provision process were 1) ineffective review and approval practices relating to taxes, and 2) inadequate
controls over the preparation of the quarterly tax provision. 

Remediation procedures: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, management
undertook the following remediation steps for the material weaknesses: 

Management reviewed, expanded, and enhanced documentation of the current processes related to percentage of completion accounting
and the foreign tax provision process.   

Management designed, documented, and implemented additional control procedures related to the review of the foreign tax provision
and the calculation of percentage of completion accounting for job orders, including controls over the use of spreadsheets. Management
also engaged third-party tax experts at our Canada and U.K. operations to assist in the tax provision process.   

Management provided additional professional education to key personnel involved in revenue recognition and has assigned a permanent
full-time employee to review contracts as part of its percentage of completion revenue recognition process.   

Management tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the control procedures.   

At March 31, 2016, management concluded that the
material weakness related to income taxes was fully remediated. As of September 30, 2016, the material weaknesses
related to revenue recognition were fully remediated.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

CUI Global, Inc. and its subsidiaries are
not a party in any legal proceedings where they are a defendant. No director, officer or affiliate of CUI Global, Inc., any owner
of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any class of voting securities of CUI Global, Inc. or any associate of any
such director, officer, affiliate of CUI Global, Inc. or security holder is a party adverse to CUI Global, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries
or has a material interest adverse to CUI Global, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the following risk factor as well as the other factors discussed in Part I,
Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Commission on March 14, 2016. 

The United Kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the European
Union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.  

On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held
in the United Kingdom to determine whether the country should remain a member of the European Union, with voters approving to withdraw
from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Following the results of this referendum, the U.K. government is expected to begin
discussions with the EU on the terms and conditions of the proposed withdrawal from the EU. Current uncertainty over whether the
U.K. will ultimately leave the EU, as well as the final outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and EU, could have an adverse
effect on our business and financial results. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the terms negotiated between the U.K.
and the EU, which may take years to complete. Our Orbital operations in the U.K., could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty
caused by Brexit. 

The announcement of Brexit caused significant
volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term
and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may adversely affect our results of
operations. During periods of a strengthening dollar, the local currency results of our international operations may translate
into fewer U.S. dollars. Uncertainty over Brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our customers, who may curtail or
postpone near-term capital investments or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams
from these customers. 

In addition, Brexit could lead to legal
uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.
Our U.K. operations may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the
rest of the EU. 

The U.K. may need to adopt specific legislation
and apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate EU member states. This may impact our overall business opportunities
to operate in the EU and U.K. seamlessly. These added challenges may impact our customers' overall business, which may impact our
volume and revenue. 

Any of these effects of Brexit, among others,
could adversely affect our business and financial results.
