NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   
 Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. ( Kandi Technologies ) was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 31, 2004. Kandi
Technologies changed its name from Stone Mountain Resources, Inc. to Kandi
Technologies, Corp. on August 13, 2007. On December 21, 2012, Kandi Technologies
changed its name to Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. As used herein, the term the
 Company  means Kandi Technologies and its operating subsidiaries, as described
below.  
 Headquartered in the Jinhua city, Zhejiang Province, China, the
Company is one of China s leading producers and manufacturers of electrical
vehicle products, electrical vehicle parts and off road vehicles for sale in the
People s Republic of China (the  PRC ) and global markets. The Company conducts
its primary business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Zhejiang
Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. ( Kandi Vehicles ), and the partial and wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Kandi Vehicles.  
 The Company s organizational chart is as follows:  
 7 

Operating Subsidiaries:  
 Pursuant to relevant agreements executed in January 2011, Kandi
Vehicles is entitled to 100% of the economic benefits, voting rights and
residual interests (100% profits and loss absorption rate) of Jinhua Kandi New
Energy Vehicles Co., Ltd. ( Kandi New Energy ), a company in which Kandi
Vehicles has 50% interest. Mr. Hu Xiaoming owns the other 50% which he entrusted
Kandi Vehicles to manage Kandi New Energy. Kandi New Energy currently holds
battery packing production rights (license), and supplies the battery pack to
the JV Company (Defined below). It didn t maintain the special-purpose vehicle
production rights (license) on manufacturing Kandi brand electric utility
vehicles. According to the JV Agreement (defined below),Kandi is not allowed to
produce EVs. To avoid the maintenance fee on this license, the Company
anticipates to close the sale of the special-purpose vehicle production rights
(license) to a third party. The Ministry of Industrial and Information
Technology of the People s Republic of China has approved this transaction and
the transfer is in process.

In April 2012, pursuant to a share exchange agreement, the
Company acquired 100% of Yongkang Scrou Electric Co, Ltd. ( Yongkang Scrou ), a
manufacturer of automobile and EV parts. Yongkang Scrou currently manufactures
and sells EV drive motors, EV controllers, air conditioners and other electrical
products to the JV Company (defined below).  
 In March 2013, pursuant to a joint venture agreement (the  JV
Agreement ) entered into by Kandi Vehicles and Shanghai Maple Guorun Automobile
Co., Ltd. ( Shanghai Guorun ), a 99%-owned subsidiary of Geely Automobile
Holdings Ltd. ( Geely ), the parties established Zhejiang Kandi Electric
Vehicles Co., Ltd. (the  JV Company ) to develop, manufacture and sell EV
products and related auto parts. Each of Kandi Vehicles and Shanghai Guorun has
50% ownership interest in the JV Company. In March 2014, the JV Company changed
its name to Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. At present, the JV Company
is a holding company with products that are manufactured by its subsidiaries.
For JV Company s better development, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the parent
company of Geely, became the direct holding company of the JV Company on October
26, 2016 by completing the purchase of the 50% equity of the JV Company held by
Shanghai Guorun with a premium price, or a purchase price exceeding the cash
amount of the aggregate of the original investment and the shared profits over
the years. 
 In March 2013, Kandi Vehicles formed Kandi Electric Vehicles
(Changxing) Co., Ltd. ( Kandi Changxing ) in the Changxing (National) Economic
and Technological Development Zone. Kandi Changxing is engaged in the production
of EV products. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Kandi Vehicles entered into an
ownership transfer agreement with the JV Company pursuant to which Kandi
Vehicles transferred 100% of its ownership in Kandi Changxing to the JV Company.
The Company, indirectly through its 50% ownership interest in the JV Company,

 In July 2013, Zhejiang ZuoZhongYou Electric Vehicle Service
Co., Ltd. (the  Service Company ) was formed. The Service Company is engaged in
various pure EV leasing businesses, which is called  Micro Public Transportation
( MPT ) program. The Company has 9.5% ownership interest in the Service Company
through Kandi Vehicles.  
 In November 2013, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Jinhua Co.,

Company, indirectly through its 50% ownership interest in the JV Company, has
50% economic interest in JiHeKang.  
 In December 2013, the JV Company entered into an ownership
transfer agreement with Shanghai Guorun pursuant to which the JV Company
acquired 100% ownership of Kandi Electric Vehicles (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. ( Kandi
Shanghai ). As a result, Kandi Shanghai is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the JV
Company, and the Company, indirectly through its 50% ownership interest in the
JV Company, has 50% economic interest in Kandi Shanghai.  
 9 

In January 2014, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Jiangsu Co.,
Ltd. ( Kandi Jiangsu ) was formed by the JV Company. The JV Company has 100%
ownership interest in Kandi Jiangsu, and the Company, indirectly through its 50%
ownership interest in the JV Company, has 50% economic interest in Kandi
Jiangsu. The company is mainly engaged in EV research and development,
manufacturing and sales.  
 In November 2015, Hangzhou Puma Investment Management Co., Ltd.
( Puma Investment ) was formed by the JV Company, which focuses on the
investment and consulting service. The JV Company has 50% ownership interest in
Puma Investment(the other 50% was owned by Zuozhongyou Electric Vehicles Service
(Hangzhou) Co.,Ltd., a subsidiary of Service Company, and the Company,
indirectly through its JV Company, has 25% economic interest in Puma Investment.
The other 50% ownership is held by the Service Company.

focuses on the after-market service for the EV products sold. The JV Company has
100% ownership interest in JiHeKang Service Company, and the Company, indirectly
through its JV Company, has 50% economic interest in JiHeKang Service Company.
 
 In January 2016, Kandi Electric Vehicles (Hainan) Co., Ltd.
( Kandi Hainan ) was renamed from Kandi Electric Vehicles (Wanning) Co., Ltd.
( Kandi Wanning ) which was originally formed in Wanning City of Hainan Province
by Kandi Vehicles and Kandi New Energy in April 2013 and then was transferred to
Haikou City in January 2016. Kandi Vehicles has 90% ownership in Kandi Hainan,
and Kandi New Energy has the remaining 10% interest. However, Kandi Vehicles is,
effectively, entitled to 100% of the economic benefits, voting rights and
residual interests (100% profits and losses) of Kandi Hainan.  
 The Company s primary business operations are designing,
development, manufacturing and commercialization of EV products, EV parts and
off-road vehicles. As part of its strategic objective to become a leading
manufacturer of EV products (through the JV Company) and related services, the
Company has increased its focus on pure EV related products with a particular
emphasis on expanding its market shares in China.  
  NOTE 2   LIQUIDITY   
 The Company had a working capital surplus of $65,512,593 as of
September 30, 2016, an increase of $5,595,440 from $59,917,153 as of December
31, 2015.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had credit lines from
commercial banks of $35,676,489. The Company believes that its cash flows
generated internally may not be sufficient to support the growth of future
operations and to repay short-term bank loans for the next twelve (12) months.
However, the Company believes its access to existing financing sources and
established relationships with PRC banks will enable it to meet its obligations
and fund its ongoing operations.  
 The Company has historically financed its operations through
short-term commercial bank loans from PRC banks. The term of these loans is
typically for one year, and upon the payment of all outstanding principal and
interest in a particular loan, the banks have typically rolled over the loan for
an additional one-year term, with adjustments made to the interest rate to
reflect prevailing market rates. The Company believes this practice has been
ongoing year after year and that short-term bank loans remain available on
normal trade terms if needed.

 All intra-entity profits and losses with the Company s equity

  NOTE 5   USE OF ESTIMATES   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the
time the estimates are made; however actual results when ultimately realized
could differ from those estimates.  
  NOTE 6 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
  (a)   Economic and Political Risks   
 The Company s operations are conducted in the PRC. As a result,
the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be
influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, and by
the general state of the PRC economy. In addition, the Company s earnings are
subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are
denominated in Renminbi ( RMB ), which is the Company s functional currency.
Accordingly, the Company s operating results are affected by changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB.  
 The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to special
considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in
North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among
others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency
exchange. The Company s performance may be adversely affected by changes in the
political and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental
policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures,
currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation,
among other things.  
 12 

(b)   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in
measuring fair value are observable in the market.  
 These tiers include:  
 Level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in
active markets;  
 Level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active
markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  
 Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no
market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.  
 The company s financial instruments primarily consist of cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable,
other receivable, accounts payable, other payables and accrued liabilities,
short-term bank loans, notes payable, and warrants.  
 The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, other receivable, accounts payable,
other payables and accrued liabilities and notes payable approximate fair value
because of the short term nature of these items. The estimated fair values of
short-term bank loans were not materially different from their carrying value as
presented due to the short maturities and that the interest rates on the
borrowing approximate those that would have been available for loans of similar
remaining maturity and risk profile. As the carrying amounts are reasonable
estimates of the fair value, these financial instruments are classified within
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company identified notes payable as a
Level 2 instrument due to the fact that the inputs to the valuation are
primarily based upon readily observable pricing information. The balance of
notes payable, which was measured and disclosed at fair value, was $3,093,511
and $3,850,478 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Warrants, which are accounted as liabilities, are treated as
derivative instruments, and are measured at each reporting date for their fair
value using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of warrants was $0 and $3,823,590 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Also see Note 6(t).  
  (c)   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 The Company considers highly-liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
 Restricted cash, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, represented time deposits on account for earning interest income. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s restricted cash was
$14,240,615 and $16,172,009, which includes a one-year Certificate of Time
Deposit (CD) of $11,992,098 with Hangzhou Bank Jinhua Branch, among which
$5,996,049 will mature on September 29, 2017 and the remaining $5,996,049 will
mature on October 29, 2017.  
 13 

(d)   Inventories   
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value (market value). The cost of raw materials is determined on the basis of
weighted average. The cost of finished goods is determined on the weighted
average basis and comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate
proportion of overhead.  
 Net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less
selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred for completion.
Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are
made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances.
 
  (e)   Accounts Receivable   
 Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at net
realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in periods in
which the Company determines a loss is probable, based on its assessment of
specific factors, such as troubled collections, historical experience, accounts
aging, ongoing business relations and other factors. Accounts are written off
after an exhaustive collection effort. If accounts receivable are to be provided
for, or written off, they are recognized in the consolidated statement of
operations within the operating expenses line item. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts, as per
the management s judgment based on their best knowledge.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the credit
terms with the Company s customers were typically 210 to 240 days and 150 to 180
days respectively after delivery. The Company extended the credit term with its
customers this year to a longer period as referenced above due to the delayed
subsidy payments from the government on EV sales.  
  (f)   Notes receivable   
 Notes receivable represent short-term loans to third parties
with the maximum term of one year. Interest income will be recognized according
to each agreement between a borrower and the Company on an accrual basis. If
notes receivable are paid back or written off, that transaction will be
recognized in the relevant year. If the loan default is probable, reasonably
assured and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company will recognize
income if the written-off loan is recovered at a future date. In case of any
foreclosure proceedings or legal actions being taken, the Company provides an
accrual for the related foreclosure expenses and related litigation expenses.
The Company also receives notes receivable from the JV Company to settle the
accounts receivable. If the Company wants to discount the notes receivables for
the purpose of receiving immediate cash, the current discount rate is 3.00%
annually. As at the end of September 30, 2016, the Company had notes receivables
of $1,969,252. Among which $428,268 will mature within 3 months and the
remaining $1,540,984 will mature within 6 months.  
  (g)   Prepayments   
 Prepayments represent cash paid in advance to suppliers, which
also includes advances to raw material suppliers, mold manufacturers, and
suppliers of equipment.  
 As of December 31, 2013, the Company recorded a significant
prepayment made by the Company to a supplier Nanjing Shangtong Auto Technologies
Co., Ltd. ( Nanjing Shangtong ) as an advance of RMB 353 million (approximately $52,915,129)
and prepaid by Kandi Wanning (renamed to Kandi Hainan in January 2016). Nanjing Shangtong is a total solution contractor for Kandi Hainan project to provide all
the equipment and EV product design and research services. As of September 30,
2016, the advance payment related to Kandi Hainan facility construction to
Nanjing Shangtong was transferred to  construction-in-progress  as described in
Note 15.  
 14 

In June 2016, Kandi Hainan made the second prepayment of RMB 70
million (approximately $10,493,085) to Nanjing Shangtong for the design and
research of new EVs. In July 2016 and August 2016, another two prepayments of
RMB 30 million (approximately $4,497,036) and RMB 90 million (approximately
$13,491,109) respectively, were made to Nanjing Shangtong for the same purpose
of the design and research for the new EV product. Also see Note 15.  
 Advances for raw materials purchases typically are settled
within two months by the Company s receipt of raw materials. Prepayment is
offset against purchase amount after equipment or materials are delivered.  
  (h)   Property, Plant and Equipment   
 Property, Plant and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the assets estimated
useful lives, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the life of the asset or the term of the lease, whichever is
shorter. Estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Buildings  
     30 years   
   
     Machinery and equipment  
     10 years   
   
     Office equipment  
     5 years   
   
     Motor vehicles  
     5 years   
   
     Molds  
     5 years    
 The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or
otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is
included in the statements of income. The cost of maintenance and repairs is
charged to expense as incurred, whereas significant renewals and betterments are
capitalized.  
  (i)   Construction in Progress   
 Construction in progress ( CIP ) represents the direct costs of
construction, the acquisition cost of buildings or machinery and design fees.
Capitalization of these costs ceases, and the construction in progress is
transferred to plant and equipment, when substantially all the activities
necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use are completed. No
depreciation is provided until the assets are completed and ready for their
intended use. No interest expense has been capitalized for CIP as of September
30, 2016, as the Company did not get loans for CIP.  
  (j)   Land Use Rights   
 According to Chinese laws, land in the PRC is owned by the
government and land ownership rights cannot be sold to an individual or to a
private company. However, the government grants the user a  land use right  to
use the land. The land use rights granted to the Company are being amortized
using the straight-line method over a term of fifty years.  
 15 

(k)   Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets   
 The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
long-lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets subject to
amortization, when events and circumstances warrant such a review, pursuant to
the guidelines established in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
( SFAS ) No. 144 (now known as  ASC 360 ). The carrying value of a long-lived
asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from
such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In
that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset. Fair market value is
determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed
of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are
reduced for the cost to dispose.  
 During the reporting period, no impairment loss was recognized.
 
  (l)   Revenue Recognition   
 Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods sold. Revenue is
recognized when the Company ships the goods to its customers and all of the
following criteria are met:  
 
   Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
   Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
   The seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and
   Collectability is reasonably assured.   
 The Company recognized revenue when the products and the risk
they carry are transferred to the other party.  
  (m)   Research and Development   
 Expenditures relating to the development of new products and
processes, including significant improvements to existing products, are expensed
as incurred. Research and development expenses were $522,806 and $785,450 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and
development expenses were $1,222,967 and $1,928,091 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  (n)   Government Grants   
 Grants and subsidies received from the PRC Government are
recognized when the proceeds are received or collectible and the related
milestones have been reached and all contingencies have been resolved.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $
594,323 and $-724 (due to the depreciation in RMB against U.S. dollars) of
grants were received by the Company s subsidiaries from the PRC government. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $2,292,180 and $92,139 of
grants were received by the Company s subsidiaries from the PRC government.  
  (o)   Income Taxes   
 The Company accounts for income tax using an asset and
liability approach, which allows for the recognition of deferred tax benefits in
future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are
provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. The accounting for deferred tax
calculation represents the management s best estimate on the most likely future
tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
or tax returns and related future anticipation. A valuation allowance is
provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will
either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that
future realization is uncertain.  
 16 

(p)   Foreign Currency Translation   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
presented in United States dollars. The functional currency of the Company is
Renminbi (RMB). Capital accounts of the consolidated financial statements are
translated into United States dollars from RMB at their historical exchange
rates when the capital transactions occurred.  
 Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as
of balance sheet date. Income and expenditures are translated at the average
exchange rate of the reporting period, which rates are obtained from the
website:  http://www.oanda.com   

(q)   Comprehensive Income   
 Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in
equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to
owners. Among other disclosures, all items that are required to be recognized
under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income are
required to be reported in a financial statement that is presented with the same
prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net
income and the foreign currency translation changes.  
  (r)   Segments   
 In accordance with ASC 280-10,  Segment Reporting , the
Company s chief operating decision makers rely upon the consolidated results of
operations when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance of the Company. As a result of the assessment made by the chief
operating decision makers, the Company has only one single operating segment.
The Company does not distinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of
internal reporting.  
  (s)   Stock Option Expenses   
 The Company s stock option expenses are recorded in accordance
with ASC 718 and ASC 505.  
 The fair value of stock options is estimated using the
Black-Scholes-Merton model. The Company s expected volatility assumption is
based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The expected
life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the option. The
risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  
 17 

The recognition of the stock option expenses is based on awards
expected to vest, and there were no estimated forfeitures. ASC standards require
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent
periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  
 The stock-based option expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,777,121 and $6,109,666, respectively. The
stock-based option expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $13,885,604 and $8,146,221, respectively. See Note 19.  
  (t)   Warrant Costs   
 The Company s warrant costs are recorded in liabilities in
accordance with ASC 480, ASC 505 and ASC 815.  
 We adopted the binomial tree valuation approach to estimate the
fair value of the warrants. In binomial tree valuation approach, it is assumed
that the life of the warrant (from Valuation Date to Expiration Date) is
typically divided into many steps (or nodes). In each step there is a binomial
stock price movement. With more steps, possible stock price paths are implicitly
considered. Valuation of warrant is performed iteratively, starting at each of
the final nodes (those that may be reached at the time of expiration), and then
working backwards through the tree towards the first node (valuation date). The
value computed at each stage is the value of the warrant at that point in time.
 
  (u)   Goodwill   
 The Company allocates goodwill from business combinations to
reporting units based on the expectation that the reporting unit is to benefit
from the business combination. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an
annual basis and, if necessary, reassigns goodwill using a relative fair value
allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit
level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could
include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating
performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant
portion of a reporting unit.  
 Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgments,
including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and
liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and
the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company first
assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that goodwill is impaired. If the more likely than not threshold is met, the
Company performs a quantitative impairment test.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company determined that its
goodwill was not impaired.  
  (v)   Intangible assets   
 Intangible assets consist of trade names and customer relations
associated with the purchase price from the allocation of Yongkang Scrou. Such
assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 9.7 years.
Intangible assets were amortized as of September 30, 2016. The amortization
expenses for intangible assets were $20,524 and $20,524 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $61,571 and $61,571 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 18 

(w)   Accounting for Sale of Common Stock and Warrants
  
 Gross proceeds are firstly allocated according to the initial
fair value of the freestanding derivative instruments (i.e. the warrants issued
to the Company s investors in its previous offerings, or the  Investor
Warrants ). The remaining proceeds are allocated to common stock. The related
issuance expenses, including the placement agent cash fees, legal fees, the
initial fair value of the warrants issued to the placement agent and others were
allocated between the common stock and the Investor Warrants based on how the
proceeds are allocated to these instruments. Expenses related to the issuance of
common stock were charged to paid-in capital. Expenses related to the issuance
of derivative instruments were expensed upon issuance.  
  (x)   Consolidation of variable interest entities
  
 In accordance with accounting standards regarding consolidation
of variable interest entities, or VIEs, VIEs are generally entities that lack
sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial
support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making
ability. All VIEs with which the Company is involved must be evaluated to
determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The
primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting
purposes.  
 The Company has concluded, based on the contractual
arrangements, that Kandi New Energy is a VIE and that the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Kandi Vehicles, absorbs a majority of the risk of loss from the
activities of these companies, thereby enabling the Company, through Kandi
Vehicles, to receive a majority of their respective expected residual returns.
 
 Additionally, as Kandi New Energy is under common control with
other entities, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if
the transactions had occurred retroactively as to the beginning of the reporting
period of these consolidated financial statements.  
 Control and common control are defined under the accounting
standards as  an individual, enterprise, or immediate family members who hold
more than 50 percent of the voting ownership interest of each entity.  Because
the owners collectively own 100% of Kandi New Energy, and have agreed to vote
their interests in concert since the establishment of each of these three
companies as memorialized the Voting Rights Proxy Agreement, the Company
believes that the owners collectively have control and common control of the
company. Accordingly, the Company believes that Kandi New Energy was
constructively held under common control by Kandi Vehicles as of the time the
Contractual Agreements were entered into, establishing Kandi Vehicles as their
primary beneficiary. Kandi Vehicles, in turn, is owned by Continental, which is
owned by the Company.  
  NOTE 7   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
 Recent accounting pronouncements that the Company has adopted
or may be required to adopt in the future are summarized below.  
 In March 2016, the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU )No. 2016-07  Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures:
Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,  which aims to
identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining
or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial
statements. The amendments in this Update affect all entities that have an
investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a
result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.
The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date
to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that
result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted.
We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU
2016-07 on our consolidated financial statements.  
 19 

In March 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-08  Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  which requires the entity to determine
whether the nature of its promise is to provide good or service to the customer
(that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be
provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent).
This determination is based upon whether the entity controls the good or the
service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this Update
affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The
core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update
affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective
date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same
as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09. Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by
one year. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2016-08 on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-09  Topic 718,
Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting,  which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be
reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update affect
all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas
for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on
the statement of cash flows. The amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718
that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No.
123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all
other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or
annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU
2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-10  Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing.  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of
the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the
following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the
licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for
those areas. The amendments in this Update clarify that contractual provisions
that, explicitly or implicitly, require an entity to transfer control of
additional goods or services to a customer (for example, by requiring the entity
to transfer control of additional rights to use or rights to access intellectual
property that the customer does not already control) should be distinguished
from contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, define the
attributes of a single promised license (for example, restrictions of time,
geographical region, or use). The amendments in this Update affect the guidance
in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), which is not yet effective. We are currently in the process of
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-10 on our consolidated
financial statements.  
 20 

In May 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-12  Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients . The amendments in this Update add a project to its technical agenda
to improve Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, by reducing: 1. the
potential for diversity in practice at initial application; 2. the cost and
complexity of applying Topic 606 both at transition and on an ongoing basis. The
amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the
scope of Topic 606. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition
requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective
date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by
Update 2014-09). We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2016-12 on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-13  Topic 326,
Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments . The amendments in this Update provide financial statement users
with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on
financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting
entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this
Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a
methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss
estimates. The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in
leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The
amendments in this Update affect an entity to varying degrees depending on the
credit quality of the assets held by the entity, their duration, and how the
entity applies current GAAP. For public business entities that are U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the amendments in this Update
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public business
entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
For all other entities, including not-for-profit entities and employee benefit
plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan accounting, the
amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2021. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-15  Topic 230,
Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments . The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight
specific cash flow issues:(1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs;(2)
Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon
Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate
of the Borrowing;(3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business
Combination;(4) Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims;(5) Proceeds
from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including
Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies;(6) Distributions Received from Equity Method
Investees;(7) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions;(8) Separately
Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The
amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of
the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in
practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business
entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect the adoption of
ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 NOTE 9  EARNINGS PER SHARE  
 The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with
ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share , which requires a dual presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed using the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.
Diluted earnings per share represents basic earnings per share adjusted to
include the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants
and convertible notes (using the if-converted method). For the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average number of dilutive
common shares was 0 and 0, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the average number of dilutive common shares was 0 and 274,744,
respectively. The potential dilutive common shares as of September 30, 2016 and
2015 were 4,900,000 and 949,419 shares respectively.

payable are due. Simultaneously, the Company may need to deposit restricted cash
in banks to back up the bank notes payable. The restricted cash deposited in
banks will generate interest income.  
 Notes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
were summarized as follows:  

A bank acceptance note is a promised future payment or time
draft, which is accepted and guaranteed by a bank and drawn on a deposit at the
bank. The banker's acceptance specifies the amount of money, the date, and the
person to which the payment is due.  
 After acceptance, the draft becomes an unconditional liability
of the bank, but the holder of the draft can sell (exchange) it for cash at a
discount to a buyer who is willing to wait until the maturity date for the funds
in the deposit. $3,093,511 and $3,850,478 were held as collateral for the notes
payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
  NOTE 18   TAXES   
 (a) Corporation Income Tax  
 In accordance with the relevant tax laws and regulations of the
PRC, the applicable corporate income tax ( CIT ) rate for Kandi s subsidiaries
are as below:  
 30 

Company Name  
     Applicable Corporate Income Tax

Kandi Vehicles  
     15%   
   
     Kandi New Energy  
     25%   
   
     Yongkang Scrou  
     25%   
   
     Kandi Hainan  
     25%   
   
     JV Company  
     25%     

The Company, qualified as a high technology company in China,
was entitled to pay a reduced CIT rate of 15%. After combining with the research
and development tax credit of 25% on certain qualified research and development
expenses, the final effective reduced income tax rate was 16.60% . The combined
tax benefits were 49.58% . The actual effective income tax rate was reduced from
25% to 12.60% in the third quarter of 2016.  
 According to the PRC CIT reporting system, the CIT sales
cut-off base is concurrent with the value-added tax ( VAT ), which should
reported to the State Administration of Taxation ( SAT ) on a quarterly basis.
Since the VAT and CIT are accounted for on a VAT tax basis that recorded all
sales on a  State provided official invoices  reporting system, the Company is
reporting the CIT according to the SAT prescribed tax reporting rules. Under the
VAT tax reporting system, sales cut-off is not done on an accrual basis but
rather on a VAT taxable reporting basis. Therefore, when the Company adopted
U.S. GAAP using an accrual basis, the sales cut-off CIT timing (due to the VAT
reporting system) creates a temporary sales cut-off timing difference. This
difference is reflected in the deferred tax assets or liabilities calculations
on the income tax estimate reported elsewhere on the report.  
 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted ASC 740, Income
Taxes. The interpretation addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the
financial statements.  
 Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on
the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes,
accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits. The Company files income tax returns to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Services ( IRS ) and states where the Company has operations. The Company is
subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by the IRS and relevant
state tax authorities for years after 2006. During the periods open to
examination, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards ( NOLs ) for U.S.
federal and state tax purposes that have attributes from closed periods. Since
these NOLs may be utilized in future periods, they remain subject to
examination. The Company also files certain tax returns in China. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company was not aware of any pending income tax
examinations by U.S. and China tax authorities. The Company's policy is to
record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. The Company has not recorded a provision for
U.S. federal income tax as of September 30, 2016 due to the net operating loss
in 2016 and an accumulated net operating loss carry forward from prior years in
the United States.  
 31 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows:  

The Company s income tax benefit (expense) differs from the
 expected  tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
(computed by applying the U.S. Federal Income Tax rate of 34% and PRC CIT rate
of 25%, respectively, to income before income taxes) as follows:  

32 

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the
Company s net deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:  
 
 33 
 
  (b)   Tax Benefit (Holiday) Effect   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the PRC
CIT rate was 25%. Certain subsidiaries of the Company were entitled to tax
benefit (holidays) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 The combined effects of the income tax expense exemptions and
reductions available to the Company for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

NOTE 19 - STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS   
  (a)   Stock Options   
 On May 29, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company approved the grant of stock options to purchase
4,900,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.72 per share to the
Company s directors, officers and senior employees. The stock options will vest
ratably over three years and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
The Company valued the stock options at $39,990,540 and will amortize the stock
compensation expense using the straight-line method over the service period from
May 29, 2015 through May 29, 2018. The value of the options was estimated using
the Black Scholes Model with an expected volatility of 90%, expected life of 10
years, risk-free interest rate of 2.23% and expected dividend yield of 0.00%
..There was $13,885,604 stock compensation expense booked in the first three
quarters of 2016.  
 The fair value of the 4,900,000 options issued to the employees
and directors on May 29, 2015 is $8.1613 per share.  
  (b)   Warrants   
 We adopted the binomial tree valuation approach to estimate the
fair value of the warrant. In binomial tree valuation approach, it is assumed
that the life of the warrant(from Valuation Date to Expiration Date) is
typically divided into many steps(or nodes). In each step there is a binomial
stock price movement. With more steps, possible stock price paths are implicitly
considered. Valuation of warrant is performed iteratively, starting at each of
the final nodes (those that may be reached at the time of expiration), and then
working backwards through the tree towards the first node (valuation date). The
value computed at each stage is the value of the warrant at that point in time.
 
 On June 26, 2013, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement (the  2013 Securities Purchase Agreement ) with certain
institutional investors (the  Third Round Investors ) that closed on July 1,
2013, pursuant to which the Company sold to the Third Round Investors, in a
registered direct offering, an aggregate of 4,376,036 shares of the Company s
common stock at a negotiated purchase price of $6.03 per share. Under the 2013
Securities Purchase Agreement, the Third Round Investors also received Series A
warrants for the purchase of up to 1,750,415 shares of the Company s common
stock at an exercise price of $7.24 per share and an option to make an
additional investment in the form of Series B warrants and Series C warrants,
Series B warrants to purchase a maximum aggregate of 728,936 shares of the
Company s common stock at an exercise price of $7.24 per share and Series C
warrants to purchase a maximum aggregate of 291,574 shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of $8.69 (the  Third Round Warrants ). As of
June 30, 2014, all the Third Round Warrants had been exercised on a cash basis.
In addition, the placement agent for this transaction also received warrants for
the purchase of up to 262,562 shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise price of
$7.24 per share (the  Third Round Placement Agent Warrants ). Based on the terms
of the warrants, they contain the downward ratchet protection and anti-dilution
terms, so the Company classified these warrants as liabilities on the balance
sheet. On July 1, 2016, the Third Round Placement Agent Warrants expired without
any exercise.  
 34 

On January 15, 2014, the Company sold to certain institutional
investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,429,393 shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of $15 per share (the  January 2014 Warrants )
for a total purchase price of approximately $14,294. According to the warrant
subscription agreement by and among the Company and the holders, the exercise
price was reduced by a credit of $0.01, which reflected the price per warrant
share paid in connection with the issuance of the January 2014 Warrants.
Consequently, the effective exercise price per warrant share is $14.99. Based on
the terms of the warrants, they contain the downward ratchet protection and
anti-dilution terms, so the Company classified these warrants as liabilities on
the balance sheet. The January 2014 Warrants expired on January 30, 2015 and no
investors exercised their warrants.  
 On March 19, 2014, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement with certain purchasers (the  Fourth Round Investors ),
pursuant to which the Company sold to the Fourth Round Investors, in a
registered direct offering, an aggregate of 606,000 shares of common stock, at a
negotiated purchase price of $18.24 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to
the Company of approximately $11,053,440, before deducting fees to the placement
agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. As part of
the transaction, the Fourth Round Investors also received warrants for the
purchase of up to 90,900 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise
price of $22.80 per share (the  Fourth Round Warrants ). In addition, the
placement agent for this transaction also received warrants for the purchase of
up to 36,360 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $22.80
per share, which was adjusted to $9.72 on July 27, 2015. The Fourth Round
Warrants have a term of eighteen months and are exercisable by the holders at
any time after the date of issuance. On August 8, 2015, the Company extended the
expiration date of these warrants from September 21, 2015 to January 20, 2016,
among these warrants, 44,783 shares were exercised in January 2016 and the rest
warrant shares were expired without exercise. Based on the terms of the
warrants, they contain the downward ratchet protection and anti-dilution terms,
so the Company classified these warrants as liabilities on the balance sheet.
 
 On September 4, 2014, the Company entered in a securities
purchase agreement with certain purchasers (the  Fifth Round Investors ),
pursuant to which the Company sold to the Fifth Round Investors, in a registered
direct offering, an aggregate of 4,127,908 shares of its common stock at a price
of $17.20 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of
approximately $71 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and
other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company (the  Fifth Round
Financing ). As part of the transaction, the Fifth Round Investors also received
warrants for the purchase of up to 743,024 shares of the Company s common stock
at an exercise price of $21.50 per share (the  Fifth Round Warrants ), which was
adjusted to $9.72 on July 27, 2015. The Fifth Round Warrants have a term of
seventeen months and are exercisable by the holders at any time after the date
of issuance. On August 8, 2015, the Company extended the expiration date of
these warrants from February 4, 2016 to June 3, 2016, and as of now these
warrants were expired without any exercise. In addition, the placement agent for
this transaction also received warrants for the purchase of up to 206,395 shares
of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $20.64 per share, which
was adjusted to $9.72 per share as the exercise price in December 2015 due to
its financial consulting service. The placement agent s warrants are exercisable
for a term of seventeen months after six months from the issuance. Based on the
terms of the warrants, they contain the downward ratchet protection and
anti-dilution terms, so the Company classified these warrants as liabilities on
the balance sheet. On August 3, 2016, all the placement agent warrants were
expired without any exercise.  
 35 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the derivative
liability relating to the warrants issued to the investors and a placement agent
was $0 and $3,823,590, respectively. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the gain related to changes in the fair value of derivative
liability relating to the warrants issued to the investors and a placement agent
was $10,692 and $3,823,590, respectively.  
  NOTE 20   STOCK AWARD   
 In connection with the appointment of Mr. Henry Yu as a member
of the Board of Directors (the  Board ), and as compensation, the Board
authorized the Company to provide Mr. Henry Yu with 5,000 shares of Company's
restricted common stock every six months, beginning in July 2011.  
 As compensation for having Mr. Jerry Lewin to serve as a member
of the Board, the Board authorized the Company to provide Mr. Jerry Lewin with
5,000 shares of Company's restricted common stock every six months, beginning in
August 2011.  
 As compensation for having Ms. Kewa Luo to serve as the
Company s investor relation officer, the Board authorized the Company to provide
Ms. Kewa Luo with 5,000 shares of Company's common stock every six months,
beginning in September 2013.  
 The fair value of stock awards based on service is determined
based on the closing price of the common stock on the date the shares are
approved by the board for grant. The compensation costs for awards of common
stock are recognized over the requisite service period of six months.  
 On December 30, 2013, the Board approved a proposal (as
submitted by the Compensation Committee) of an award ( Board s Pre-Approved
Award Grant Sub-Plan under the 2008 Plan ) for selected executives and other key
employees comprising a total of 335,000 shares of common stock for each fiscal
year, beginning with the 2013 fiscal year, under the Company s 2008 Omnibus
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2008 Plan ), if the Company s  Non-GAAP Net
Income  for the current fiscal year increased by 10% comparing to that of the
prior year. The specific number of shares of common stock to be issued in
respect of such award could proportionally increase or decrease if the actual
Non-GAAP Net Income increase is more or less than 10%.  Non-GAAP Net Income 
means the Company s net income for a particular year calculated in accordance
with GAAP, excluding option-related expenses, stock award expenses, and the
effects caused by the change of fair value of financial derivatives. For
example, if Non-GAAP Net Income for the 2014 fiscal year increased by 10%
compared to the Non-GAAP Net Income for the 2013 fiscal year, the selected
executives and other key employees each would be granted his or her target
amount of common stock of the Company. If Non-GAAP Net Income in 2014 is less
than Non-GAAP Net Income in 2013, then no common stock would be granted. If
Non-GAAP Net Income in 2014 increased compared to Non-GAAP Net Income in 2013
but the increase is less than 10%, then the target amount of the common stock
grant would be proportionately decreased. If Non-GAAP Net Income in 2014
increased compared to Non- GAAP Net Income in 2013 but the increase is more than
10%, then the target amount of the common stock grant would be proportionately
increased up to 200% of the target amount. Any such increase in the grant would
be subject to the total number of shares available under the 2008 Plan, and the
Company s Board and shareholders will need to approve an increase in the number
of shares reserved under the 2008 Plan if the number of shares originally
reserved is used up. On May 20, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved
an increase of 9,000,000 shares under the 2008 Plan at its annual meeting. The
fair value of each award granted under the 2008 Plan is determined based on the
closing price of the Company s stock on the date of grant of the award.
Stock-based compensation expense is calculated based on grant date fair value
and number of awards expected to be earned at the end of each quarter and
recognized in the quarter. In subsequent periods, stock-based compensation expense is
adjusted based on grant date fair value and the change of number of awards
expected to be earned. Final stock-based compensation expense for the year is
calculated based on grant date fair value and number of awards earned for the
year and recognized at the end of year. On September 26, 2016, the Board
approved to terminate the previous Board s Pre-Approved Award Grant Sub-Plan
under the 2008 Plan and adopted a new plan to reduce the total number of shares
of common stock of the stock award for selected executives and key employees
from 335,000 shares of common stock to 250,000 shares of common stock for each
fiscal year and the other term was as same as before. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were $4,003,250 of expense reversal and
$872,107 of employee stock award expense recognized under General and
Administrative Expenses, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, there were $0 and $4,296,060 of employee stock award expense
recognized under General and Administrative Expenses, respectively.  
 36 

The stock award was below starting from 2013 based on the award
plan above:

 The following table provides the gross carrying value and
accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible assets other than
goodwill:

that continue to be amortized is reflected in amortization of intangible assets
in the consolidated statements of income, and comprehensive income were $20,524
and $20,524 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $61,571 and $61,571 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Amortization expense for the next five years and thereafter is

NOTE 22   SUMMARIZED INFORMATION OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT
IN THE JV COMPANY   
 The Company s consolidated net income includes the Company s
proportionate share of the net income or loss of the Company s equity method
investees. When the Company records its proportionate share of net income in
such investees, it increases equity income (loss)   net in the Company s
consolidated statements of income and the Company s carrying value in that
investment. Conversely, when the Company records its proportionate share of a
net loss in such investees, it decreases equity income (loss)   net in the
Company s consolidated statements of income and the Company s carrying value in
that investment. All intra-entity profits and losses with the Company s equity
method investees have been eliminated.

March 2014, the JV Company changed its name to Kandi Electric Vehicles Group
Co., Ltd. In August 2015, the JV Company transferred its shares of the Service
Company to Shanghai Guorun and Kandi Vehicles for 9.5% respectively. As the
result, the JV Company no longer has any ownership of the Service Company since
the transfer. In November 2015, Hangzhou Puma Investment Management Co., Ltd.
( Puma Investment ) was formed by the JV Company. The JV Company has 50%
ownership interest in Puma Investment and the Company, indirectly through its
50% ownership interest in the JV Company, has 25% economic interest in Puma
Investment. In November 2015,Hangzhou JiHeKang Electric Vehicle Service Co.,
Ltd. ( JiHeKang Service Company ) was formed by the JV Company. The JV Company
has 100% ownership interest in JiHeKang Service Company and the Company,
indirectly through its 50% ownership interest in the JV Company, has 50%
economic interest in JiHeKang Service Company.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the JV Company consolidated the
following entities on its financial statements: (1) 100% interest in Kandi
Changxing; (2) 100% interest in Kandi Jinhua; (3) 100% interest in JiHeKang; (4)
100% interest in Kandi Shanghai; (5) 100% interest in Kandi Jiangsu; (6) 100%
interest in JiHeKang Service; and (7) 50% interest in Puma Investment. The
Company accounted for its investments in the JV Company under the equity method
of accounting as the Company has 50% ownership interest in the JV Company.
Therefore, the Company s consolidated net income for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, included equity income from the JV Company
during such periods.  
 The combined results of operations and financial position of
the JV Company are summarized below:  
 39 

During the first three quarters of 2016, 100% of the JV
Company s revenues were derived from the sales of EV products in the PRC with a
total of 7,384 units sold, 2,153 units of which were direct sales through the
distribution company, JiHeKang, and the rest were sold for the Micro Public
Transportation Program ( MPT  or the  EV-Share  Program). As the Company only
has a 50% ownership interest in the JV Company and accounted for its investments
in the JV Company under the equity method of accounting, the Company didn t
consolidate the JV Company s financial results but included the equity income
from the JV Company during such periods.  
 40 

Note: The following table illustrates the captions used in the
Company s Income Statements for its equity basis investments in the JV Company.
 
 Changes in the Company s equity method investment in the JV
Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Sales to the Company s customers, the JV Company and its
subsidiaries, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,181,669 or
19% of the Company s total revenue, a decrease of 96.3% of the sales to the JV
Company from the same quarter last year. Sales to the Company s customers, the
JV Company and its subsidiaries, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
were $62,125,458 or 55% of the Company s total revenue, a decrease of 41.6% of
the sales to the JV Company from the same period last year. The sales to the JV
Company and its subsidiaries were primarily the sales of battery packs, body
parts, EV drive motors, EV controllers, air conditioning units and other auto
parts, the breakdown of the sales to the JV Company and its subsidiaries is as
follows:  
 
 41 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net amount
due from the JV Company was $114,763,704 and $76,172,471, respectively, of which
the majority was the balances with the JV Company, Kandi Jinhua, Kandi
Changxing, Kandi Jiangsu and Kandi Shanghai. The breakdown is as below:  
 
 The amount due from the JV Company included a one-year
entrusted loan of $22,485,182 that Kandi Vehicle lent to the JV Company from
December 16, 2015 to June 15, 2016 and then extended to December 16, 2016
carrying an annual interest rate 8.7%, which will not be adjusted after the
withdrawal during the lending period. The loan was organized by Bank of
Communications Hangzhou Zhongan Branch as the agent bank between Kandi Vehicle
and the JV Company. Entrusted loans are commonly found in China, where direct
borrowing and lending between commercial enterprises are restricted.  
  NOTE 23   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
  Guarantees and pledged collateral for third party bank
loans   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
provided guarantees for the following third parties:  
 (1) Guarantees for bank loans  
 
 On March 15, 2013, the Company entered into a guarantee
contract to serve as the guarantor of Nanlong Group Co., Ltd. ( NGCL ) from
March 15, 2016 to March 15, 2018 for NGCL's loan amount of $2,998,024 from
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Jinhua Branch with related loan period from
March 15, 2013 to March 15, 2016, which was extended to September 15, 2016. NGCL
is not related to the Company but it has provided guarantees for the Company in
the past due to industry customs. Under this guarantee contract, the Company
agreed to perform all obligations of NGCL under the loan contract if NGCL fails
to perform its obligations as set forth therein.  
 42 

On July 20, 2015, the Company entered into a guarantee contract
to serve as the guarantor for the JV Company from July 20, 2016 to July 19, 2018
for the bank loans of $11,242,591 from Bank of China with related loan period
from July 22, 2016 to July 21, 2017. Under this guarantee contract, the Company
agreed to perform all obligations of the JV Company under the loan contract if
the JV Company fails to perform its obligations as set forth therein.  
 On September 29, 2015, the Company entered into a guarantee
contract to serve as the guarantor of Zhejiang Shuguang Industrial Co., Ltd.
( ZSICL ) from September 29, 2015 to September 28, 2018 for the bank loan amount
of $4,347,135 from Ping An Bank with related loan period from September 29, 2015
to September 28, 2016. ZSICL is not related to the Company. Under this guarantee
contract, the Company agreed to perform all obligations of ZSICL under the loan
contract if ZSICL fails to perform its obligations as set forth therein.  
 On December 14, 2015, the Company entered into a guarantee
contract to serve as the guarantor for the JV Company from December 14, 2016 to
December 13, 2018 for the bank loans of $37,475,304 from China Import  
Export Bank with related loan period from December 14, 2015 to December 13,
2016. Under this guarantee contract, the Company agreed to perform all
obligations of the JV Company under the loan contract if the JV Company fails to
perform its obligations as set forth therein.  
 For the Company guarantee for NGCL and ZSIC, it is a common
practice that among companies in the region of the PRC in which the Company is
located to exchange guarantees for bank debts with no additional consideration
given. It is considered a  favor for favor  business practice and is commonly
required by Chinese lending banks. Now with Kandi s creditability improvement in
the bank, the related banks have no requirement to ask the third party to
provide the company guarantee for Kandi, and the Company decides not to provide
new guarantee obligations to them accordingly in the proper time.  
 The Company was a party to enter into contracts to indemnify a
third party for certain liabilities, and as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company guaranteed the third party s long-term loan from other
companies amounting to $56,063,054 and $57,603,154 that matured at various times
in 2018, as a guarantor. In most cases, the Company cannot estimate the
potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise
that would result in a liability under the indemnities. The Company believes
that the liabilities for potential future payments of these guarantees and
indemnities are not probable.  
 (2) Pledged collateral for a third party s bank loans  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of the
Company s land use rights or plant and equipment were pledged as collateral
securing bank loans to third parties.  
  NOTE 24  SEGMENT REPORTING   
 The Company has only one single operating segment. The
Company s revenue and long-lived assets are primarily derived from and located
in the PRC. The Company only has operations in the PRC.

Item 2.        
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.   
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our
future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by terminology, such as  may,   will,   should,   could,   expect, 
 plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   project,   predict,   intend, 
 potential  or  continue  or the negative of such terms or other comparable
terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms.
 
 In addition, these forward-looking statements include, but are
not limited to, statements regarding implementing our business strategy;
development and marketing of our products; our estimates of future revenue and
profitability; our expectations regarding future expenses, including research
and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing and general and
administrative expenses; difficulty or inability to raise additional financing,
if needed, on terms acceptable to us; our estimates regarding our capital
requirements and our needs for additional financing; attracting and retaining
customers and employees; sources of revenue and anticipated revenue; and
competition in our market.  
 Forward-looking statements are only predictions. Although we
believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements. All of our forward-looking information is subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results expected. Although it is not possible to identify all factors, these
risks and uncertainties include the risk factors and the timing of any of those
risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and those set forth from time to time in our other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). These documents are
available on the SEC s Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System
at  http://www.sec.gov.   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 This section should be read together with the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies in the attached consolidated financial
statements included in this report.  
  Policy affecting options, warrants and Stock award   
 Our stock option cost is recorded in accordance with ASC 718
and ASC 505. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the
Black-Scholes-Merton model. Our expected volatility assumption is based on the
historical volatility of our common stock. The expected life assumption is
primarily based on the expiration date of the option. The risk-free interest
rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant. Stock option expense recognition is based
on awards expected to vest. There were no estimated forfeitures. ASC standards
require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in
subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates.  
 Our warrant costs are recorded in liabilities in accordance
with ASC 480, ASC 505 and ASC 815. The fair value of a warrant is estimated
using the binomial tree valuation approach. In binomial tree valuation approach,
it is assumed that the life of the warrant(from Valuation Date to Expiration
Date) is typically divided into many steps(or nodes). In each step there is a
binomial stock price movement. With more steps, possible stock price paths are
implicitly considered. Valuation of warrant is performed iteratively, starting
at each of the final nodes (those that may be reached at the time of
expiration), and then working backwards through the tree towards the first node
(valuation date). The value computed at each stage is the value of the warrant
at that point in time.  
 46 

Our stock award for the employee is based on the Company annual
performance achieved in the year. The Company annual performance will determine
the pool of the stock award and the stock issued to an individual will be also
linked with the individual s performance. The performance-based stock award
expense is recorded in accordance with ASC 718 and ASC 505. The fair value of
stock awards based on service is determined based on the closing price of the
common stock on the date the shares are approved by the board for grant. We
calculated the stock award expense by using the yearly accumulated basis
compared to the same period last year and true-up the expense at the year end.
 
  Estimates affecting accounts receivable and inventories 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reporting
of assets and liabilities (and contingent assets and liabilities). These
estimates are particularly significant where they affect the reported net
realizable value of our accounts receivable and inventories.  
 Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at net
realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the period
when a loss is probable based on an assessment of specific factors, such as
troubled collection, historical experience, accounts aging, ongoing business
relations and other factors. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts
at collection. If accounts receivable are to be provided for, or written off,
they would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within
operating expenses. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded
no allowance for doubtful accounts. This determination was made per our
management s judgment, which was based on their best knowledge.  
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined on a
weighted average basis, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are
made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances.
When inventories are sold, their carrying amount is charged to expense in the
year in which the revenue is recognized.  
 Write-downs for declines in net realizable value or for losses
of inventories are recognized as an expense in the year the impairment or loss
occurs.  
 Although we believe that there is little likelihood that actual
results will differ materially from current estimates, if customer demand for
our products decreases significantly in the near future, or if the financial
condition of our customers deteriorates in the near future, we could realize
significant write downs for slow-moving inventories or uncollectible accounts
receivable.  
  Revenue Recognition   
 Our revenue recognition policy plays a key role in our
consolidated financial statements. Revenues represent the invoiced value of
goods sold, recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers, and revenues are
recognized when all of the following criteria are met:  
 47 

1.  
     
       Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;   

2.  
     
       Delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered;   

3.  
     
       The seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable;
      and    

4.  
     
       Collectability is reasonably
assured.    
 The revenue recognition policies for our legacy products,
including EV products, EV parts and Off-road vehicles, are the same: When the
products are delivered, the associated risk of loss is deemed transferred, and
at that time we recognize revenue.  
  Warranty Liability   
 Most of our non-EV products (the  Legacy Products ) are
exported out of China to foreign countries that have legal and regulatory
requirements with which we are not familiar with. Development of warranty
policies for our Legacy Products in each of these countries would be virtually
impossible and prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we provide price incentives
and free parts to our customers and in exchange, our customers establish
appropriate warranty policies and assume warranty responsibilities.
Consequently, warranty issues are taken into consideration during the price
negotiation for our products. The free parts are delivered along with the
products, and when products are sold, the related parts are recorded as cost of
goods sold. Due to the reliable quality of our products, we have been able to
maintain this warranty policy and we have not had any product liabilities
attributed to the quality of our products.  
 For the EV products that we sell (through the JV Company)in
China, there is an eight-year or 120,000 kilometer manufacturer warranty
implemented by the JV Company. This warranty affects us through our
participation and investment in the JV Company, which manufactures the EV
products.  
  Overview   
 We are one of the leading producers and manufacturers of
electrical vehicle products (through the JV Company), electrical vehicle parts
and off road vehicles in China. Our primary source of revenue is from the sale
of our EV parts. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized
total revenue of $6,366,380 as compared to $50,528,545 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $44,162,165 or 87.4%, primarily due to the
weak EV parts demand from the JV Company and its subsidiaries. Gross margin for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 10.2%, a decrease from 14.1% for the
quarter ended September 30, 2015. We continue to increase our sales of our
legacy products and the off-road vehicles revenue increased $106,322 or 6.8% as
compared to the same period a year ago, mainly from its organic growth.  
 The construction of our Hainan facility is on track and we
expect it will be completed for production testing in the middle of 2017 as
planned. The Hainan project has received great support from Hainan provincial
government with a RMB 300 million (approximately USD 45 million) of government
subsidy to assist its research and development on a new model of electric
vehicle, of which the initial payment of RMB100 million (approximately USD15
million) has already been received.  
 48 

The JV Company continues to enhance its vehicle offering and
debuted its new model of  Global Hawk K21  in August 2016, a newly developed
mid-tier luxury pure electric vehicle, which has received significant interest
from the public. Beginning early 2016, the government launched an industry-wide
review of subsidies, which negatively impacted the JV Company s operations and
sales this year. Accordingly, our EV Parts sales to the JV Company and its
subsidiaries have also been negatively impacted. Meanwhile, there have been
certain misunderstandings from government regarding the EV battery exchange
method, which was initiated by the JV Company for efficient battery utilization.
The JV Company has been working diligently with the government and related
authorities to clarify this issue. We believe there will be a positive outcome
and the issue of subsidy delay will be resolved in the coming quarters, which
will help us to regain the revenue growth momentum.  
 On April 29, 2015, the Central Government announced the subsidy
policy for new energy vehicles from year 2016 to 2020, which indicates the
subsidy of year 2017-2018 will be reduced by 20% based on the rate in year 2016,
and the subsidy of year 2019-2020 will be reduced by 40% based on the rate in
year 2016. Although we are confident the Government has firm commitment to
support the growth of China s EV industry and the subsidy program itself will
continue through 2020, the JV Company and us are actively seeking new revenue
growth avenue and optimizing our business model to cope with this industry-wide
policy change. Our long-term goal is, through improving technical capabilities,
optimizing cost structure and increasing operation efficiency, to develop
high-performance yet price-competitive EVs for our end consumers to meet market
demand and sustainably grow our business. The Company will continue to work
closely with Geely, leverage its support, and seek additional strategic alliance
or partnership to jointly develop the JV Company s EV business and rapidly
expand its business footprint in China.  
  Results of Operations   
  Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015   
 The following table sets forth the amounts and percentage
relationship to revenue of certain items in our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  

49 

(a)   Revenue   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue was
$6,366,380 compared to $50,528,545 for the same period of 2015, a decrease of
$44,162,165 or 87.4% . The decrease in revenue during this period was largely
due to the decrease in EV parts sales caused by the weak demand from the JV
Company because of temporary suspension of the EV subsidies. The majority of the
EV parts sales were battery sales.  
 The following table summarizes our revenues as well as the
number of units sold by product types for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015:  

EV Parts  
 Among our total revenues during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, approximately $4,712,106 resulted from the sale of EV parts,
a decrease of $44,243,315 or 90.4% compared to $48,955,421 for the same period
of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the temporary suspension of the
government subsidies to EVs as mentioned above which resulted in the decreased
EV parts demand from the JV Company and its subsidiaries. Our EV parts sales
primarily consisted of the sales of battery packs, body parts, EV drive motors,
EV controllers, air conditioning units and other auto parts to the JV Company
for manufacturing of EV products.  
 EV Products  
 Among our total revenues during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, there was no EV products sales ($-25,172 was due to exchange
rate change), because the manufacture of EV products was transferred to the JV
Company based on the JV Agreement. Under the JV Agreement with our joint venture
partner, since March 2013, our EV
products manufacturing business has been gradually transferred to the JV
Company, such transfer was completed at the end of 2014. We are now primarily responsible for supplying the JV Company with EV
parts and the JV Company is primarily responsible for the production of EV
products.  
 50 

Off-Road Vehicles  
 Among our total revenues during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, approximately $1,679,446 or 26.4% resulted from the sale of
off-road vehicles. The off-road vehicles revenue increased $106,322, or 6.8%
compared to $1,573,124 for the same period of 2015, mainly from its organic
growth.  
  (b)   Cost of goods sold   
 Cost of goods sold was $5,715,211 during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $37,696,628, or 86.8%, compared
to $43,411,839 in the same period of 2015. This decrease was mainly due to the
decrease in corresponding sales.  
  (c)   Gross profit   
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 decreased 90.9% to
$651,169, compared to $7,116,706 for the same period last year. Margin by
product is as below:  

The overall margin decreased from 14.1% of the third quarter of
2015 to 10.2% of the same period of 2016. The decrease in gross margin was
largely due to the significant decrease of production volume caused by the
temporary suspension of EV subsidies payment from government.  
  (d)   Selling and distribution expenses   
 Selling and distribution expenses were $374,102 for the third
quarter of 2016, compared to $122,873 for the same period last year, an increase
of $251,229 or 204.5%. This increase was primarily due to the amortization for
the product maintenance expense in battery in this period, which will be
amortized for the next eight years.  
  (e)   General and administrative expenses   
 General and administrative expenses were $373,411 for the third
quarter of 2016, compared to $8,649,541 for the same period of last year, a
decrease of $8,276,130 or 95.7%. For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
general and administrative expenses included a $1,203,204 of reduction
adjustment for common stock awards and stock options to employees because of
reduced profits this period, compared to $7,028,089 of expenses for common stock
awards and stock options to employees for the same period in 2015. Excluding
stock award and stock option costs, our net general and administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $ 1,576,615, a decrease of
$44,837, or 2.8%, from $1,621,452 for the same period of 2015.  
 51 

(f)   Research and development   
 Research and development expenses were $522,806 for the third
quarter of 2016, a decrease of $262,644 or 33.4% compared to $785,450 for the
same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to the materials spending
decrease for the research projects in the third quarter of 2016.  
  (g)   Government grants   
 Government grants were $ 594,323 for the third quarter of 2016,
an increase of $ 595,047 compared to $-724 (due to the change resulting from the
RMB depreciation against the US dollars) for the same period of last year. The
increase was mainly due to the receipts of various government awards and
incentives during this quarter.  
  (h)   Interest income   
 Interest income was $832,031 for the third quarter ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $308,725 compared to $1,140,756 for the same
period of last year. This decrease was primarily due to the reduced interest
income earned on the loan to a third party and the cash in the bank.  
  (i)   Interest expense   
 Interest expense was $425,152 for the third quarter of 2016, a
decrease of $109,835 compared to $534,987 for the same period of last year. This
change was primarily due to the renewed loans with a lower interest rate in year
2016. In 2015, China People s Bank reduced the one-year loan interest rate for
five times from 5.6% at the beginning of 2015 to 4.35% in October of 2015.
Consequently, all the renewed loans in 2016 have a lower interest rate from the
year beginning compared to the same period of 2015.  
  (j)   Change in fair value of financial instruments
  
 For the third quarter of 2016, the gain related to changes in
the fair value of derivative liability relating to the warrants issued to the
investors and a placement agent was $10,692, a decrease of $3,038,550 compared
to $3,049,242 in the same period last year. The decrease was due to the
expiration of all remaining unexercised warrants in the third quarter of 2016.
 
  (k)   Share of profit (loss) after tax of the JV
Company   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the JV Company s
net sales was $11,688,178, gross profit was $5,937,134, and net loss was
$426,797. We accounted for our investments in the JV Company under the equity
method of accounting as we have a 50% ownership interest in the JV Company. As a
result, we recorded 50% of the JV Company s loss of $213,399 for the third
quarter of 2016. After eliminating intra-entity profits and losses, our share of
the after tax loss of the JV Company was $299,538 for the third quarter of 2016,
a change of $1,479,143 compared to $1,179,605 of gain for the same period last
year. The decrease of the JV Company s profits was primarily due to the decrease
in sales in the third quarter of 2016.  
 52 

During the third quarter of 2016, a total of 184 units of EV
products were sold by the JV Company, compared to 6,004 units sold in the same
period of 2015.The decrease was due to the temporary suspension of EV subsidies
payment from government.  
  (l)   Other income (expense), net   
 Net other expense was $106,299 for the third quarter of 2016, a
change of $ 1,094,523 compared to $988,224 of net other income for the same
period of last year. The higher net other income in the third quarter of 2015
was primarily due to the fees received for providing technical services during
the period of last year.  
  (m)   Net income (loss) from continuing operation
  
 Net loss was $565,941 for the third quarter of 2016, a change
of $2,909,136 compared to $2,343,195 of net income for the same period of last
year.  
 Excluding (i) the effects of employee stock compensation
expenses, which were $ 1,203,204 of expense reversal and $7,028,089 of expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively; and (ii)
the change of the fair value of financial derivatives, which were $10,692 of
gain and $3,049,242 of gain for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, our non-GAAP net loss was $1,779,837 for the third quarter
of 2016 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $6,322,042 for the same period of
2015, a decrease of $8,101,879 of net income. This decrease in non-GAAP net
income was primarily attributable to the decrease of revenue and gross profits
as the result of weak performance of the JV Company during the third quarter of
2016 comparing to its corresponding quarter last year.  
 We make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, i.e.,
the adjusted net income. Management believes that such adjusted financial result
is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it
presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance. See the non-GAAP
reconciliation table below. Any non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a
substitute for, and should only be read in conjunction with measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015   
 The following table sets forth the amounts and percentage
relationship to revenue of certain items in our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  
 53 

54 

(a)   Revenue   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue was
$112,241,641 compared to $142,273,091 for the same period of 2015, a decrease of
$30,031,450 or 21.1% . The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the decrease in
EV parts sales during this period, which was largely caused by the decreased
demand from the JV Company and its subsidiaries. The sales to the JV Company and
subsidiaries were down 42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the same period last year. Beginning early 2016, the Chinese
government temporally suspended issuing EV subsidies to all EV manufacturers in
China for an industry-wide review of subsidies, which negatively impacted the JV
Company s EV sales this year and our EV Parts sales to the JV Company. The
majority of the EV parts sales were battery sales.  
 The following table summarizes our revenues by product types
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

EV Parts  
 Among our total revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, approximately $ 104,716,584, or 93.3%, resulted from the sale of EV
parts. Our revenue of EV parts decreased $33,868,263, or 24.4%, compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was largely due to the
decreased EV parts demand from the JV Company and its subsidiaries. Our EV parts
sales primarily consisted of the sales of battery packs, body parts, EV drive
motors, EV controllers, air conditioning units and other auto parts to the JV
Company for manufacturing of EV products.  
 EV Products  
 Among our total revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, approximately $3,754,444, or 3.3%, resulted from the sale of EV
products. The EV products revenue increased $3,754,444, or 100% compared to the
same period of 2015. Under the JV Agreement with our joint venture partner, starting from March 2013, our EV products
manufacturing business has been gradually transferred to the JV Company, which
was completed at the end of 2014, but the Company can continue to sell the EV
products which were in the stock. We are now primarily responsible for supplying
the JV Company with EV parts and the JV Company is primarily responsible for the
production of EV products.  
 Off-Road Vehicles  
 Among our total revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, approximately $ 3,770,613, or 3.4%, resulted from the sale of off-road
vehicles. The off-road vehicles revenue increased $82,369, or 2.2%, compared to
the same period of 2015, mainly from its organic growth.  
 55 

(b)   Cost of goods sold   
 Cost of goods sold was $ 96,417,337 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $ 25,876,852, or 21.2%,
compared to $122,294,189 in the same period of 2015. This decrease was mainly
due to the decrease in corresponding sales.  
  (c)   Gross profit   
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
decreased 20.8% to $ 15,824,304, compared to $19,978,902 for the same period
last year. Margin by product was as below:  

The overall margin increased from 14.0% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to 14.1% for the same period of 2016. The increase was
largely because the margin of battery packs has improved due to the cost
savings.  
  (d)   Research and development   
 Research and development expenses were $1,222,967 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $705,124 or 36.6% compared to
$1,928,091 for the same period of last year. This decrease was primarily due to
the less materials spending for research projects in the first nine months of
the year.  
  (e)   Selling and distribution expenses   
 Selling and distribution expenses were $1,150,880 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $312,284 for the same period last
year, an increase of $ 838,596 or 268.5% . This increase was primarily due to
the product maintenance expense on battery in this year, which will be amortized
for the next eight years.  
  (f)   General and administrative expenses   
 General and administrative expenses were $ 18,031,487 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16,275,202 for the same
period of last year, an increase of $1,756,285 or 10.8%. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses included $13,954,379 in expenses for common stock awards and stock options to employees
and consultants, compared to $12,559,581 for the same period in 2015. Excluding
stock award costs, our net general and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,077,108, an increase of $361,487, or
9.7%, from $3,715,621 for the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily
due to the increase in land use taxes for Hainan project.  
 56 

(g)   Government grants   
 Government grants were $2,292,180 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, an increase of $2,200,041 or 2,387.7% compared to $92,139
for the same period of last year. The increase was mainly due to the $1,421,976
relocation allowance received by Kandi Hainan and various government awards
received during this year such as technologies innovation and financial rewards
based on the taxes contribution.  
  (h)   Interest income   
 Interest income was $2,397,364 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $56,715 or 2.3% compared to $2,454,079 for the
same period of last year. This decrease was primarily due to reduced interest
income earned on the loan to a third party and the cash in the bank.  
  (i)   Interest expense   
 Interest expense was $1,299,549 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $431,349 or 24.9% compared to $1,730,898 for
the same period of last year. This change was primarily due to the renewed loans
with a lower interest rate in year 2016. In 2015, China People Bank reduced the
one-year loan interest rate for five times from 5.6% at the beginning of 2015 to
4.35% in October 2015. Therefore all the renewed loans in 2016 have a lower
interest rate compared to the same period in 2015.  
  (j)   Change in fair value of financial instruments
  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gain related
to changes in the fair value of derivative liability relating to the warrants
issued to the investors and a placement agent was $3,823,590, a decrease of
$7,978,996 compared to $11,802,586 of gain in the same period of last year. The
change in the fair value of derivative liability is mainly because all remaining
unexercised warrants expired during the year of 2016.  
  (k)   Share of profit (loss) after tax of the JV
Company   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the JV Company s
net sales were $122,959,660, gross profit was $19,538,305, and net profit was $131,323. We accounted for our investments in the JV Company under the equity
method of accounting as we have a 50% ownership interest in the JV Company. As a
result, we recorded 50% of the JV Company s profit for $ 65,662 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. After eliminating intra-entity profits and
losses, our share of the after tax loss of the JV Company was $ 203,375 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2,103,503 compared to
$1,900,128 of profits in the same period of last year, the main cause for the
decrease of the JV Company s profits is due to the decrease of sales and gross
profits in the first nine months of 2016.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a total of
7,384 units of EV products were sold by the JV Company, compared to 12,120 units
sold in the same period of 2015.  
  (l)   Other income, net   
 Net other income was $202,878 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $891,400 or 81.5% compared to $1,094,278 in
the same period of last year. The higher other income last year was primarily
due to the receipts of fees for providing technical services for project K-17
technical development last year.  
 57 

(m)   Net income from continuing operation   
 Net income was $2,315,659 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, a decrease of $11,584,691 compared to the net income of $13,900,350
for the same period of last year. Excluding (i) the stock award and stock option
expenses, which were $ 13,954,379 and $12,559,581 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and (ii) the change of the fair value
of financial derivatives, which was $3,823,590 of gain and $11,802,586 of gain
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, our
non-GAAP net income was $12,446,448 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to $14,657,345 for the same period of 2015, a decrease of
$2,210,897. This decrease in non-GAAP net income was primarily attributable to
the decrease in revenue and gross profits as of the result of decreased EV parts
demand from the JV Company and its subsidiaries.  
 We make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, i.e.,
the adjusted net income. Management believes that such adjusted financial result
is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it
presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance. See the non-GAAP
reconciliation table below. Any non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a
substitute for, and should only be read in conjunction with measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
   Cash Flows    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in
operating activities was $22,307,888, as compared to $1,126,747 used for the
same period of last year.  
 58 

Below is the cash flows statement for the operating activities:

The major operating activities that provided cash for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were an increase in accounts payable of $
40,240,135 and a decrease in due from related party (other than the JV Company)
of $ 28,994,314, and an increase in other payables and accrued liabilities of
$10,415,706, which was mainly from the receipt of government grants for Hainan
new EV product design and development. The major operating activities that used
cash for nine months ended September 30, 2016 were an increase in receivables
from the JV Company of $41,182,480 and from other clients of $33,335,798, and an
increase in prepayments and prepaid expenses of $31,684,685.  
 Below is the cash flows statement for the investing activities:
 
 59 

Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $8,178,367 compared to cash used in investing activities
of $12,326,105 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The major investing
activities that provided cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
the repayment of notes receivable of $62,415,498. The major investing
activities that used cash for nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the
issuance of notes receivable of $51,553,604.  
 Below is the cash flow statement for the financing activities:

Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $1,291,195 compared to cash used in financing activities
of $2,600,585 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The major financing
activities that provided cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
the proceeds from notes payable of $5,187,040. The major financing activities
that used cash for nine months ended September 30, 2016 was repayment of notes
payable of $5,849,988.  
   Working Capital    
 We had a working capital surplus of $65,512,593 at September
30, 2016, compared to $59,917,153 as of December 31, 2015.  
 60 

We have historically financed our operations through short-term
commercial bank loans from PRC banks. The term of these loans is typically for
one year, and upon the payment of all outstanding principal and interest in a
particular loan, the banks have typically rolled over the loan for an additional
one-year term, with adjustments made to the interest rate to reflect prevailing
market rates. We believe that this situation has not changed and that short-term
bank loans will be available on normal trade terms if needed.  
   Capital Requirements and Capital Provided    
 Capital requirements and capital provided for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

The difference between capital provided and capital required
was caused by the effect of exchange rate changes over the past nine months.
 
  Recent Development Activities:   
 On August 8, 2016, we announced that Kandi Hainan had reached
an agreement with the Hainan Provincial Government for Kandi Hainan to receive a
RMB 300 million (approximately USD 45.1 million) subsidy to support its research
and development expenditures on a new model of electric vehicle. The subsidy
payment schedule is based on the progress of Kandi Hainan s new model
development and the initial payment of RMB100 million (approximately USD15
million) has already been received.  
 On August 31, 2016, we announced that the  Micro Public
Transportation Program  or  MPT Program,  the program operated by Zhejiang
ZuoZhongYou Electric Vehicle Service Co., Ltd, along with other programs and
brand experiences such as the  Free West Lake Tour, the  Beijing-Hangzhou Grand
Canal,  the  Xixi National Wetland Park, the  Right-of-Way in the Crosswalk, and
the  Hangzhou Resident Identification Card,  has been recognized as a  Hangzhou
Top20 Best Brand Experiences  in the  G20 Top20.  Descriptions of the winners
were included in the official brochure given as a city souvenir to all reporters and participants attending the upcoming G20 summit. The MPT
Program was the only winner in the renewable energy vehicle sector for being
selected into the official brochure. 
 61 

On September 6, 2016, we announced that the JV Company has
signed a purchase and sale agreement with Qingdao TELD New Energy Co. Ltd.
( Qingdao TELD ) to sell its  Global Hawk  series all- EVs in Qingdao City,
Shandong Province. The JV Company has received an initial payment of RMB56
million (approximately US$8.4 million) from Qingdao TELD. 
 On October 20, 2016, we announced that the JV Company had
signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanxi Coal Asset Management Group
( Shanxi Coal ) to sell over 50,000 EVs during a five-year cooperation period.
Shanxi abounds in mineral resources and has tremendous market potential, with a
strong demand for zero emission all-electric vehicles. Our cooperation agreement
with Shanxi Coal is a major milestone in our successful expansion throughout
China. The initial payment of RMB 27,408,000 (or approximately USD $4 million)
has already been received as of the date of this report.  
  Item 3.        
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
  Exchange Rate Risk   
 Our operations are conducted mainly in the PRC. As such, our
earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when
transactions are denominated in Chinese Renminibi ( RMB ), which is our
functional currency. Accordingly, our operating results are affected by changes
in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB currencies.  
  Economic and Political Risks   
 Our operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations
and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America
and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the
political, economic and legal environment in the PRC and foreign currency
exchange. Our performance may be adversely affected by changes in the political
and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with
respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency
conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other
things.  
  Item 4.        
 Controls and Procedures.   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 We have evaluated, under the supervision of our Chief Executive
Officer ( CEO ) and our Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), the effectiveness of
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) as
of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that
as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.  
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives as described above.  
 62 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.  
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
  Item 1A.        Risk
Factors   
   The delay, reduction, unavailability, or elimination of
government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.    
 Although the central government has clear policies encouraging
qualified EVs, any delay, reduction, or elimination of government subsidies and
economic incentives caused may result in the reduced or diminished
competitiveness of the new energy  vehicle industry generally or our EV
products in particular. In the first nine months of 2016, our JV Company did not
receive subsidies from central government on the EV products sold in year 2015.
This period of subsidy suspension was a result of an industry-wide government
investigation on EV manufacturers in China with regards to any potential
violation of new energy vehicle subsidy policy, starting from the beginning of
2016. The subsidy suspension period impacted the JV Company s financial
conditions including the sales and cash flow. In the event that any favored
policy and treatment delays or discontinues, our business outlook and financial
conditions could be negatively impacted.  
 On April 29, 2015, the four government departments in the PRC,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology and National Development and Reform Commission
jointly announced the subsidy policy for new energy vehicles from year 2016 to
2020, which declares the subsidy of year 2017-2018 will be reduced by 20% based
on the rate in year 2016, and the subsidy of year 2019-2020 will be reduced by
40% based on year 2016. Furthermore, the policy enhanced the threshold for
receipt of the subsidy by increasing the driving range for eligible EVs from 80
kilometers to 100 kilometers. This policy may impact the Company s future
business and profitability growth.  
   Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our
business and the value of our securities.    
 Starting from April 2015, Chinese currency turned into the
depreciation trend which continued in year 2016. Compared with the lowest point
from RMB versus USD in 2015, RMB has depreciated by 9.1% against USD as of September 30, 2016. Concerns remain that China s slowing
economy, and in particular its exports, will need a stimulus that can only come
from further cuts in the exchange rate.  
 The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by
the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those
currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because
substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in RMB,
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will
affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars. In
addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the
U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms
without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of
operations.
