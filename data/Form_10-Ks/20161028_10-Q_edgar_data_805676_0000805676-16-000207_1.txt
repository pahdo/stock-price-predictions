  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1     Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included in this report have been prepared for Park National Corporation (sometimes also referred to as the  Registrant ) and its subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "Park", the "Corporation" or the "Company" and similar terms mean Park National Corporation and its subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods included herein have been made. The results of operations for the three-month period and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be anticipated for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed balance sheets, condensed statements of income, condensed statements of comprehensive income, condensed statements of changes in shareholders  equity and condensed statements of cash flows in conformity with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Park for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 from Park s 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders ( Park's 2015 Annual Report ).  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  Park s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Park s 2015 Annual Report. For interim reporting purposes, Park follows the same basic accounting policies, as updated by the information contained in this report, and considers each interim period an integral part of an annual period.  

Note 2     Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   The ASU creates a new topic, Topic 606, to provide guidance on revenue recognition for entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Park's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2015-02 - Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  : In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810)  :   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . The ASU amends the current consolidation guidance and affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have an impact on Park s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01   - Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    Changes to the current U.S. GAAP model primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.  The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Park's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842):    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 -   Leases (Topic 842)  .  The ASU will require all organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

obligations created by those leases.  Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be required so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Park's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-09 - Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting:    In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09 -   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The ASU provides simplification for several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Park's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments:    In June 2016, FASB issued   ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  .  The new guidance replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model.  Upon initial recognition of the exposure, the CECL model requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure.  The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, and reinsurance receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor.  The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. 
    
  Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on Park's consolidated financial statements, but anticipates that it will have a material impact on Park's allowance for loan losses.  Management has established a committee to oversee the implementation of CECL.  This committee is currently assessing the data and system requirements necessary for adoption. 
    
  ASU 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 203): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force):      In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 203): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  .  This ASU provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues where current GAAP is either unclear or does not include specific guidance.  The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  As such transactions arise, management will utilize the updated guidance within Park s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Note 3     Loans 
    
  The composition of the loan portfolio, by class of loan, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

* Included within commercial, financial and agricultural loans and commercial real estate loans is an immaterial amount of consumer loans that are not broken out by class. 
    
  Loans are shown net of deferred origination fees, costs and unearned income of   $11.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $10.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  , which represented a net deferred income position in both periods. 
    
  Overdrawn deposit accounts of   $2.8 million   and   $1.7 million   have been reclassified to loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural loan class above.

Credit Quality 
    
  The following tables present the recorded investment in nonaccrual loans, accruing troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"), and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing by class of loan as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

13 

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides additional information regarding those nonaccrual loans and accruing TDR loans that were individually evaluated for impairment and those collectively evaluated for impairment as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

All of the loans individually evaluated for impairment were evaluated using the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows as the measurement method.  
    
  The following table presents loans individually evaluated for impairment by class of loan, together with the related allowance recorded, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

14 

     Table of Contents  

Management s general practice is to proactively charge down loans individually evaluated for impairment to the fair value of the underlying collateral. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $16.7 million   and   $24.2 million  , respectively, of partial charge-offs on loans individually evaluated for impairment with no related allowance recorded and   $5.5 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, of partial charge-offs on loans individually evaluated for impairment that also had a specific reserve allocated. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses included specific reserves of   $4.2 million   related to loans individually evaluated for impairment at each of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  These loans with specific reserves had a recorded investment of   $16.0 million   and   $19.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Interest income on loans individually evaluated for impairment is recognized on a cash basis only when Park expects to receive the entire recorded investment of the loan. The following table presents the average recorded investment and interest income recognized subsequent to impairment on loans individually evaluated for impairment as of and for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  :

Credit Quality Indicators 
    
  Management utilizes past due information as a credit quality indicator across the loan portfolio. Past due information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is included in the tables above. The past due information is the primary credit quality indicator within the following classes of loans: (1) mortgage loans and installment loans in the construction real estate segment; (2) mortgage loans, HELOC and installment loans in the residential real estate segment; and (3) consumer loans. The primary credit indicator for commercial loans is based on an internal grading system that grades commercial loans on a scale from 1 to 8. Credit grades are continuously monitored by the responsible loan officer and adjustments are made when appropriate. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (graded an 1 through a 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that require management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of Park s credit position at some future date. Commercial loans graded 6 (substandard), also considered to be watch list credits, are considered to represent higher credit risk and, as a result, a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Park will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Commercial loans that are graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonaccrual and Park generally charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording a specific reserve. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Certain 6-rated loans and all 7-rated loans are placed on nonaccrual status and included within the impaired category.  A loan is deemed impaired when management determines the borrower's ability to perform in accordance with the contractual loan agreement is in doubt.  Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged off. 
    
  The tables below present the recorded investment by loan grade at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for all commercial loans: 

* Included within commercial, financial and agricultural loans and commercial real estate loans is an immaterial amount of consumer loans that are not broken out by class.

  Troubled Debt Restructurings ("TDRs") 
    
  Management classifies loans as TDRs when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and Park has granted a concession to the borrower as part of a modification or in the loan renewal process. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of the borrower's debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed in accordance with the Company s internal underwriting policy. Management s policy is to modify loans by extending the term or by granting a temporary or permanent contractual interest rate below the market rate, not by forgiving debt. A court's discharge of a borrower's debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is considered a concession when the borrower does not reaffirm the discharged debt. Certain loans which were modified during the   three  -month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   did not meet the definition of a TDR as the modification was a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant. Management considers a forbearance period of up to three months or a delay in payment of up to 30 days to be insignificant. TDRs may be classified as accruing if the borrower has been current for a period of at least six months with respect to loan payments and management expects that the borrower will be able to continue to make payments in accordance with the terms of the restructured note. Management reviews all accruing TDRs quarterly to ensure payments continue to be made in accordance with the modified terms. 
    
  Management reviews renewals/modifications of loans previously identified as TDRs to consider if it is appropriate to remove the TDR classification.  If the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty and the renewal/modification does not contain a concessionary interest rate or other concessionary terms, management considers the potential removal of the TDR classification. If deemed appropriate, the TDR classification is removed as the borrower has complied with the terms of the loan at the date of the renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the renewal/modification. The majority of these TDRs were originally considered restructurings in a prior year as a result of a renewal/modification with an interest rate that was not commensurate with the risk of the underlying loan at the time of the renewal/modification. During the   three  -month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , Park removed the TDR classification on   $335,000   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, of loans that met the requirements discussed above.  The TDR classification was not removed on any loans during the   three  -month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $51.2 million   and   $41.1 million  , respectively, of TDRs included in the nonaccrual loan totals. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $42.7 million   and   $19.1 million   of these nonaccrual TDRs were performing in accordance with the terms of the restructured note. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $17.4 million   and   $25.1 million  , respectively, of TDRs included in accruing loan totals.  Management will continue to review the restructured loans and may determine it appropriate to move certain of the loans back to accrual status in the future.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Park had commitments to lend   $1.2 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively, of additional funds to borrowers whose outstanding loan terms had been modified in a TDR. 

18 

     Table of Contents  

There were   $1.9 million   and   $2.3 million   of specific reserves related to TDRs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Modifications made in   2015   and   2016   were largely the result of renewals and extending the maturity date of the loan at terms consistent with the original note. These modifications were deemed to be TDRs primarily due to Park s conclusion that the borrower would likely not have qualified for similar terms through another lender. Many of the modifications deemed to be TDRs were previously identified as impaired loans, and thus were also previously evaluated for impairment under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 310.  There were   no   additional specific reserves recorded during the   three  -month period ended September 30, 2016 as a result of TDRs identified in 2016. During the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $975,000   of additional specific reserves were recorded as a result of TDRs identified in 2016. Additional specific reserves of   $212,000   and   $1.2 million   were recorded during the   three  -month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, as a result of TDRs identified in   2015  . 
    
  The terms of certain other loans were modified during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   that did not meet the definition of a TDR. Modified substandard commercial loans which did not meet the definition of a TDR had a total recorded investment as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   of   $437,000   and   $245,000  , respectively. The renewal/modification of these loans: (1) resulted in a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant, or (2) resulted in Park obtaining additional collateral or guarantees that improved the likelihood of the ultimate collection of the loan such that the modification was deemed to be at market terms.  Modified consumer loans which did not meet the definition of a TDR had a total recorded investment of   $5.1 million   and   $12.8 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Many of these loans were to borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulties but who were looking to reduce their cost of funds. 
    
  The following tables detail the number of contracts modified as TDRs during the   three  -month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , as well as the recorded investment of these contracts at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The recorded investment pre- and post-modification is generally the same due to the fact that Park does not typically provide for forgiveness of principal.

Note 4     Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") is that amount management believes is adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio based on management s evaluation of various factors including overall growth in the loan portfolio, an analysis of individual loans, prior and current loss experience, and current economic conditions. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of these and other pertinent factors as discussed within Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Park s 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Loss factors are reviewed quarterly and updated at least annually to reflect recent loan loss history and incorporate current risk and trends which may not be recognized in historical data.  Several enhancements were made in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of management's quarterly review. 
             
    Management updated the historical loss calculation during the third quarter of 2016, incorporating annualized net charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves through September 30, 2016.  Additionally, management removed net charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Management's belief has been that historical losses should encompass the complete economic cycle.  However, given the extended length of the recovery, management determined that 2009 data was no longer reflective of the current portfolio.  Management has taken the look back period into consideration in the quarterly evaluation of environmental loss factors. 
     As part of this mid-year historical loss update, management determined that it was no longer appropriate to more heavily weight those years with higher losses in the historical loss calculation and applied equal percentages to each of the years in this calculation.  The trends that existed resulting in management applying this weighting no longer appear to exist, resulting in the adjustment back to equal weightings.

     Table of Contents  

As part of the normal quarterly process, management reviewed and updated the environmental loss factors applied to the commercial portfolio in order to incorporate changes in the macroeconomic environment.  Additionally, management updated the calculation of the loss emergence period. 
     The impact of the changes as described above resulted in a decrease of   $3.8 million   in the ALLL at September 30, 2016, compared to what the ALLL would have been had the calculation, and related assumptions, used at June 30, 2016 remained constant. 
    
  The activity in the allowance for loan losses for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   is summarized below.

Loans collectively evaluated for impairment in the following tables include all performing loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as well as nonperforming loans internally classified as consumer loans. Nonperforming consumer loans are not typically individually evaluated for impairment, but receive a portion of the statistical allocation of the allowance for loan losses. Loans individually evaluated for impairment include all impaired loans internally classified as commercial loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are evaluated for impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Park s 2015 Annual Report).

Note 6     Earnings Per Common Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Park awarded   41,550   and   23,025   performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs") to certain employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    No   PBRSUs were awarded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  As of September 30, 2016,   85,425   PBRSUs were outstanding. The PBRSUs vest based on service and performance conditions. The dilutive effect of the outstanding PBRSUs was the addition of   68,916   and   40,721   common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   71,023   and   41,131   common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Park repurchased   no   common shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Park repurchased   20,000   common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2015, and   41,500   common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to fund the PBRSUs and common shares awarded to directors of Park and to directors of Park's subsidiary PNB (and its divisions). 

Note 7     Segment Information 
    
  The Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Newark, Ohio.  The operating segments for the Corporation are its chartered national bank subsidiary, The Park National Bank (headquartered in Newark, Ohio) ( PNB ), SE Property Holdings, LLC ( SEPH ), and Guardian Financial Services Company ( GFSC ). 
    
  Management is required to disclose information about the different types of business activities in which a company engages and also information on the different economic environments in which a company operates, so that the users of the financial statements can better understand the company s performance, better understand the potential for future cash flows, and make more informed judgments about the company as a whole. Park has   three   operating segments, as: (i) discrete financial information is available for each operating segment and (ii) the segments are aligned with internal reporting to Park s Chief Executive Officer and President, who is the chief operating decision maker.

  Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at their fair value. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, Park had approximately   $15.2 million   and   $7.3 million   in mortgage loans held for sale. These amounts are included in loans on the consolidated condensed balance sheets and in the residential real estate loan segments in Note 3 and Note 4. The contractual balance was   $15.0 million   and   $7.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The gain expected upon sale was   $200,000   and   $95,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. None of these loans were 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual status as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  During the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2015  , Park transferred to held for sale and sold certain commercial loans previously held for investment, with a book balance of   $144,000  , and recognized a gain of   $756,000  . There were   no   commercial loans held for sale or sold during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 or during the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016  .

Management does not believe any of the unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   represented other-than-temporary impairment. Should the impairment of any of these securities become other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized within net income in the period the other-than-temporary impairment is identified. 
    
  Park s U.S. Government sponsored entities' asset-backed securities consist of   15  -year residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investments in debt securities at   September 30, 2016  , are shown in the following table by contractual maturity, except for asset-backed securities, which are shown as a single total, due to the unpredictability of the timing of principal repayments. 

All of Park s securities shown in the table above as U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government sponsored entities' notes are callable notes.  These callable securities have final maturities of   1   to   4   years. Of the   $269.1 million   reported at   September 30, 2016  ,   none   were expected to be called.  The remaining average life of the investment portfolio is estimated to be   4.0   years.

Note 11 -   Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Park National Corporation 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2013 Incentive Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors of Park on January 28, 2013 and was approved by Park's shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 22, 2013. The 2013 Incentive Plan makes equity-based awards and cash-based awards available for grant to participants in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted common shares, restricted stock unit awards that may be settled in common shares, cash or a combination of the two, unrestricted common shares and cash-based awards.  Under the 2013 Incentive Plan,   600,000   common shares are authorized to be delivered in connection with grants under the 2013 Incentive Plan. The common shares to be delivered under the 2013 Incentive Plan may consist of either common shares currently held or common shares subsequently acquired by Park as treasury shares, including common shares purchased in the open market or in private transactions.   No awards may be made under the 2013 Incentive Plan after April 22, 2023.  At September 30, 2016,   483,675   common shares were available for future grants under the 2013 Incentive Plan.  
    
  On January 24, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Park granted awards of an aggregate of   21,975   performance-based restricted stock units ( PBRSUs ) to certain employees of Park, which grants were effective on January 24, 2014. On December 16, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Park granted awards of an aggregate of   23,025   PBRSUs to certain employees of Park, which grants were effective on January 2, 2015. On December 7, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Park granted awards of an aggregate of   41,550   PBRSUs to certain employees of Park, which grants were effective on January 1, 2016. The number of PBRSUs earned or settled will depend on certain performance conditions and are also subject to service-based vesting. As of September 30, 2016,   1,125   PBRSUs have been forfeited. 
    
  Share-based compensation expense of   $398,000   and   $234,000   was recognized for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $1.2 million   and   $704,000   for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Park expects to recognize additional share-based compensation expense of approximately   $389,000   through the first quarter of 2018 related to PBRSUs granted in 2014, approximately   $871,000   through the first quarter of 2019 related to PBRSUs granted in 2015 and approximately   $2.3 million   through the first quarter of 2020 related to PBRSUs granted in 2016. 

Note 12     Pension Plan 
    
  Park has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees. The plan provides benefits based on an employee s years of service and compensation.

Note 13     Loan Servicing 
    
  Park serviced sold mortgage loans of   $1.31 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.28 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   $1.27 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $4.3 million   of the sold mortgage loans were sold with recourse, compared to   $5.4 million   at December 31, 2015 and   $5.7 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Management closely monitors the delinquency rates on the mortgage loans sold with recourse. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, management had established reserves of   $270,000   and   $454,000  , respectively, to account for expected losses on loan repurchases. 
    
  When Park sells mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value. Park selected the  amortization method  as permissible within U.S. GAAP, whereby the servicing rights capitalized are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated future servicing income of the underlying loan. At the end of each reporting period, the carrying value of mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) is assessed for impairment with a comparison to fair value. MSRs are carried at the lower of their amortized cost or fair value. 
    
  Activity for MSRs and the related valuation allowance follows: 

Servicing fees included in other service income were   $0.9 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and   $0.8 million   for the same period of 2015, and were   $2.5 million   for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 14     Fair Value 
    
  The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that Park uses to measure fair value are as follows: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that Park has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2: Level 1 inputs for assets or liabilities that are not actively traded. Also consists of an observable market price for a similar asset or liability. This includes the use of  matrix pricing  to value debt securities absent the exclusive use of quoted prices. 
                
    Level 3: Consists of unobservable inputs that are used to measure fair value when observable market inputs are not available. This could include the use of internally developed models, financial forecasting and similar inputs. 
       
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants at the balance sheet date. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to observable market data for similar assets and liabilities. However, certain assets and liabilities are not traded in observable markets and Park must use other valuation methods to develop a fair value. The fair value of impaired loans is typically based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, which is estimated through third-party appraisals in accordance with Park's valuation requirements in accordance with its commercial and real estate loan policies. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  : 
    
  The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

     Table of Contents  

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   three   or nine months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . Management s policy is to transfer assets or liabilities from one level to another when the methodology to obtain the fair value changes such that there are more or fewer unobservable inputs as of the end of the reporting period. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in determining fair value of the financial assets and liabilities discussed above: 
    
  Investment securities:   Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows. 
    
  Fair value swap:   The fair value of the swap agreement entered into with the purchaser of the Visa Class B shares represents an internally developed estimate of the exposure based upon probability-weighted potential Visa litigation losses. 
    
  Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs):   IRLCs are based on current secondary market pricing and are classified as Level 2. 
    
  Mortgage loans held for sale:   Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at their fair value. Mortgage loans held for sale are estimated using security prices for similar product types and, therefore, are classified in Level 2.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis: 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis described below: 
    
  Impaired Loans:   At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value have been partially charged-off or receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is generally based on real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales approach and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral is then adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. Additionally, updated independent valuations are obtained annually for all impaired loans in accordance with Company policy. 
    
  Other Real Estate Owned (OREO):   Assets acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired. The carrying value of OREO is not re-measured to fair value on a recurring basis, but is subject to fair value adjustments when the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based on recent real estate appraisals and is updated at least annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales approach and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
    
  Appraisals for both collateral dependent impaired loans and OREO are performed by licensed appraisers. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of collateral. In general, there are three types of appraisals, real estate appraisals, income approach appraisals, and lot development loan appraisals, received by the Company. These are discussed below: 

Real estate appraisals typically incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties. Appraisers may make adjustments to the sales prices of the comparable properties as deemed appropriate based on the age, condition or general characteristics of the subject property. Management generally applies a   15%   discount to real estate appraised values which management expects will cover all disposition costs (including selling costs). This   15%   discount is based on historical discounts to appraised values on sold OREO properties. 

Income approach appraisals typically incorporate the annual net operating income of the business divided by an appropriate capitalization rate, as determined by the appraiser. Management generally applies a   15%   discount to income approach appraised values which management expects will cover all disposition costs (including selling costs). 

Lot development loan appraisals are typically performed using a discounted cash flow analysis. Appraisers determine an anticipated absorption period and a discount rate that takes into account an investor s required rate of return based on recent comparable sales. Management generally applies a   6%   discount to lot development appraised values, which is an additional discount above the net present value calculation included in the appraisal, to account for selling costs. 
       
  MSRs:   MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. MSRs do not trade in active, open markets with readily observable prices. For example, sales of MSRs do occur, but precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. As such, management, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, determines fair value based on the discounted value of the future cash flows estimated to be received. Significant inputs include the discount rate and assumed prepayment speeds. The calculated fair value is then compared to market values where possible to ascertain the reasonableness of the valuation in relation to current market expectations for similar products. Accordingly, MSRs are classified as Level 2.

     Table of Contents  

The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Collateral dependent impaired loans are carried at fair value if they have been charged down to fair value or if a specific valuation allowance has been established.  A new cost basis is established at the time a property is initially recorded in OREO.  OREO properties are carried at fair value if a devaluation has been taken to the property's value subsequent to the initial measurement.

     Table of Contents  

The table below provides additional detail on those impaired loans which are recorded at fair value as well as the remaining impaired loan portfolio not included above.  The remaining impaired loans consist of loans which are not collateral dependent  as well as loans carried at cost as the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows on each of the loans exceeded the book value for each respective credit.   

The income (expense) from credit adjustments related to impaired loans carried at fair value during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2.9 million   and   $(0.1) million  , respectively.  The income (expense) of credit adjustments related to impaired loans carried at fair value during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.9 million   and   $(1.8) million  , respectively.   
    
  MSRs totaled   $8.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Of this   $8.7 million   MSR carrying balance,   $4.3 million   was recorded at fair value and included a valuation allowance of   $1.1 million  .  The remaining   $4.4 million   was recorded at cost, as the fair value of the MSRs exceeded cost at   September 30, 2016  .  At   December 31, 2015  , MSRs totaled   $9.0 million  . Of this   $9.0 million   MSR carrying balance,   $1.9 million   was recorded at fair value and included a valuation allowance of   $0.5 million  .  The remaining   $7.1 million   was recorded at cost, as the fair value exceeded cost at   December 31, 2015  .  The (expense) income related to MSRs carried at fair value during the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $(360,000)   and   $211,000  , respectively.   The (expense) income related to MSRs carried at fair value during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $(569,000)   and   $182,000  , respectively.   
    
  Total OREO held by Park at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $14.9 million   and   $18.7 million  , respectively.  Approximately   52%   of OREO held by Park at   September 30, 2016   and   46%   at   December 31, 2015   was carried at fair value due to fair value adjustments made subsequent to the initial OREO measurement.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , OREO held at fair value, less estimated selling costs, amounted to   $7.7 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively.  The net expense related to OREO fair value adjustments was   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   three  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.6 million   and   $1.3 million   for the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used by Park in estimating its fair value disclosures for assets and liabilities not discussed above: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents:     The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated condensed balance     sheets for cash and short-term instruments approximate those assets  fair values. 
    
  FHLB Stock and FRB Stock:   These assets are carried at their respective redemption values as it is not practicable to calculate their fair values. 
    
  Loans receivable:     For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for certain mortgage loans (e.g., one-to-four family residential) are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  The methods utilized to estimate the fair value do not necessarily represent an exit price.  
    
  Off-balance sheet instruments:     Fair values for Park s loan commitments and standby letters of credit are based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. The carrying amount and fair value are not material. 
    
  Deposit liabilities:     The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, savings, and money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The carrying amounts for variable-rate, fixed-term certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of time deposits. 
    
  Short-term borrowings:     The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings approximate their fair values. 
    
  Long-term debt:     Fair values for long-term debt are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on long-term debt to a schedule of monthly maturities. 
    
  Subordinated debentures and notes:     Fair values for subordinated debentures and notes are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rate spreads currently being offered on similar debt structures to a schedule of monthly maturities.

During the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, there were   no   reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  

Note 16     Investment in Qualified Affordable Housing 
    
  Park makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects.  The purposes of these investments are to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, help create affordable housing opportunities, and assist the Company to achieve our goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act.

The table below details the balances of Park s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Park recognized amortization expense of   $1.8 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Park recognized amortization expense of   $5.5 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively, which was included within the provision for income taxes. Additionally, during each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Park recognized tax credits and other benefits from its affordable housing tax credit investments of   $2.3 million  , and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, recognized tax credits and other benefits from its affordable housing tax credit investments of   $7.0 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively.  
   
  Note 17     Repurchase Agreement Borrowings 
    
  Securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements") with customers represent funds deposited by customers, generally on an overnight basis, that are collateralized by investment securities owned by Park.  Repurchase agreements with customers are included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. Park's repurchase agreements with a third-party financial institution are classified as long-term debt on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. 
    
  All repurchase agreements are subject to terms and conditions of repurchase/security agreements between Park and the client and are accounted for as secured borrowings.  Park's repurchase agreements reflected in short-term borrowings consist of customer accounts and securities which are pledged on an individual security basis. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Park's repurchase agreement borrowings totaled   $518 million   and   $554 million  , respectively. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $300 million   of Park's repurchase agreement borrowings were classified as long-term debt with the remaining amount being classified as short-term debt on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. These borrowings were collateralized with U.S. government and agency securities with a carrying value of   $572 million   and   $622 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Declines in the value of the collateral would require Park to pledge additional securities.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Park had   $465 million   and   $583 million  , respectively, of available unpledged securities. 
    
  The following table presents the carrying value of Park's repurchase agreements by remaining contractual maturity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

On November 30, 2012, Park restructured   $300 million   in repurchase agreements with a third-party financial institution and paid a   $25 million   prepayment penalty.  The penalty is included in long-term debt and is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the repurchase agreements using the effective interest method.  Of the   $25 million    
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

prepayment penalty,   $6.0 million   and   $9.8 million   remained unamortized as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 18     Contingent Liabilities 
    
  The Company is a defendant in lawsuits and other adversary proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal costs incurred in connection with the resolution of claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred, and the Company establishes accruals for the outcome of litigation where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. The Company s assessment of the current exposure could change in the event of the discovery of additional facts with respect to legal matters pending against the Company or determinations by judges, juries, administrative agencies or other finders of fact that are not in accordance with the Company s evaluation of claims.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had accrued charges of approximately   $2.3 million   for legal contingencies related to various legal and other adversary proceedings. 

Note 19 - Subsequent Events 
    
  On October 20, 2016, Park prepaid   $50 million   of FHLB advances, incurring a   $5.6 million   prepayment penalty which will be reflected as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2016.  These advances had an interest rate of   3.15%   and a maturity date of November 13, 2023.  The advances prepaid had an expected annual expense of   $1.575 million   for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
    
  The prepayment was made using excess cash, which averaged   $220.5 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Excess cash is shown as money market instruments on the consolidated condensed balance sheets and is invested overnight with the Federal Reserve at the overnight federal funds sold rate.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Park earned   0.51%   on these money market instruments. 

ITEM 2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Management s discussion and analysis ( MD A ) contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance.  Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance.  The forward-looking statements are based on management s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.  Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.  Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation: Park's ability to execute our business plan successfully and within the expected timeframe; general economic and financial market conditions, specifically in the real estate markets and the credit markets, either nationally or in the states in which Park and our subsidiaries do business, may experience a slowing or reversal of the recent economic expansion in addition to continuing residual effects of recessionary conditions and an uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, including adverse impacts on the demand for loan, deposit and other financial services, delinquencies, defaults and counterparties' ability to meet credit and other obligations; changes in interest rates and prices may adversely impact the value of securities, loans, deposits and other financial instruments and the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated balance sheet as well as reduce interest margins; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors; changes in unemployment; changes in customers', suppliers', and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness; asset/liability repricing risks and liquidity risks; our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes to regulations governing bank and bank holding company capital and liquidity standards as well as by changes in our assets and liabilities; competitive factors among financial services organizations could increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures, changes to third-party relationships and our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified bank professionals; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; the nature, timing and effect of changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the respective businesses of Park and our subsidiaries, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes in laws and regulations concerning taxes, pensions, bankruptcy, consumer protection, accounting, banking, securities and other aspects of the financial services industry, specifically the reforms provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the  Dodd-Frank Act ), as well as regulations already adopted and which may be adopted in the future by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions, the Budget Control Act of 2011, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the JOBS Act, the FAST Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices,

     Table of Contents  

as may be adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and other regulatory agencies, and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements; the effect of trade, monetary, fiscal and other governmental policies of the U.S. federal government, including money supply and interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve; disruption in the liquidity and other functioning of U.S. financial markets; the impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the levels of U.S., European and Asian government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe and Asia; the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and its consequences; our litigation and regulatory compliance exposure, including any adverse developments in legal proceedings or other claims and unfavorable resolution of regulatory and other governmental examinations or other inquiries; the adequacy of our risk management program; the ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; the impact of widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities or international hostilities on the economy and financial markets, generally or on us or our counterparties specifically; demand for loans in the respective market areas served by Park and our subsidiaries; and other risk factors relating to the banking industry as detailed from time to time in Park's reports filed with the SEC including those described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Part I of Park's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Park does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Park s 2015 Annual Report lists significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of Park s consolidated financial statements. The accounting and reporting policies of Park conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Park believes the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and of current economic conditions. However, this evaluation has subjective components requiring material estimates, including expected default probabilities, the expected loss given default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, and estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgage loans based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional loan loss provisions may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. Refer to the  Credit Metrics and (Recovery of) Provision for Loan Losses  section within this MD A for additional discussion. 
    
  Other real estate owned ( OREO ), property acquired through foreclosure, is recorded at estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs (net realizable value). If the net realizable value is below the carrying value of the loan on the date of transfer, the difference is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent declines in value, OREO devaluations, are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of OREO and are expensed within other income. Gains or losses not previously recognized, resulting from the sale of OREO, are recognized within other income on the date of sale.  
    
  U.S. GAAP requires management to establish a fair value hierarchy, which has the objective of maximizing the use of observable market inputs. U.S. GAAP also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the inputs used to calculate fair value. These are classified as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 inputs are those with significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the market for a particular instrument. Some of these inputs could be based on internal models and cash flow analyses. The large majority of Park s assets whose fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs consists of available-for-sale ( AFS ) securities. The fair value of these AFS securities is obtained largely through the use of matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the financial services industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Please see Note 14 -   Fair Value   of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on fair value.

     Table of Contents  

Management believes that the accounting for goodwill also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. U.S. GAAP establishes standards for the impairment assessment of goodwill. Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets in the business acquired. Park s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of Park s Ohio-based banking subsidiary, The Park National Bank ( PNB ) to provide quality, cost-effective banking services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base, the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods or significant credit problems can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. U.S. GAAP requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Park s most recent evaluation was completed during the second quarter of 2016 and resulted in no impairment of goodwill. Further, there have been no events subsequent to that analysis that provide any evidence that goodwill is impaired. The fair value of the goodwill, which resides on the books of PNB, is estimated by reviewing the past and projected operating results for PNB, deposit and loan totals for PNB and banking industry comparable information.  
    
  The determination of pension plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension expense is principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses, reduced by (4) the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan. 
    
  Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension expense include: 

the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate); 
                
    certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; 
                
    the expected return on assets in our funded plan; and 
                
    for pension expense, the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings. 
       
  Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension plan expense and obligation.

  Other income of $55.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 represented a $1.4 million, or 2.5%, decrease, compared to $56.4 million for the same period in 2015. The $1.4 million decrease was primarily due to income of $1.3 million related to proceeds from the death benefits paid from bank owned life insurance policies in 2015, income of $372,000 related to the sale of a building in 2015, $544,000 in income related to check card incentives in 2015 and an aggregate decrease of $724,000 in gain on sale of OREO, net, OREO valuation adjustments, and other OREO income in 2016 compared to 2015.  These items were offset by a $732,000 increase in other service income primarily related to mortgage loan originations, a $521,000 increase in checkcard income, and a $812,000 increase in income from fiduciary activities, in each case in 2016 compared to 2015.   
    
  Other expense of $126.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 represented an increase of $1.8 million, or 1.4%, compared to $124.7 million for the same period in 2015.  The $1.8 million increase was primarily related to a $965,000 increase in salaries expense of which $401,000 was related to severance, a $1.6 million increase in furniture and equipment expense, and a $1.0 million increase in professional fees and services, offset by a decrease of $2.6 million related to employee benefits expense, largely related to a decline in medical expenses.  
    
  PNB's results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, included income and expense related to participations in legacy Vision assets.

  The following table shows the mix of average interest earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

A primary financial goal for Park is to increase the amount of quality loans on its balance sheet. Management consistently emphasizes the importance of growing quality loans. The average balance of loans for the first nine months of 2016 was $5,091 million, compared to $4,910 million for all of 2015, an increase of $181 million, or 3.7%.   
    
  Management actively manages the investment portfolio. The average balance of investment securities may increase as a result of attractive investment opportunities. Likewise, the average balance of investment securities may decrease if management sells investment securities or chooses not to reinvest the cash flow from maturities or investment repayments.

  Credit Metrics and (Recovery of) Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The (recovery of) provision for loan losses is the amount added to the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) to ensure the allowance is sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses. The amount of the (recovery of) provision for loan losses is determined by management after reviewing the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, historic and current loan loss experience and current economic conditions. 
    
  Park's Ohio-based subsidiaries, PNB and GFSC, are the only subsidiaries that carry an ALLL balance. The table below provides additional information on the (recovery of) provision for loan losses and the ALLL for Park, Park's Ohio-based operations, and SEPH for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

SEPH, as a non-bank subsidiary of Park, does not carry an ALLL balance, but recognizes a provision for loan losses when a charge-off is taken and recognizes a recovery of loan losses when a recovery is received.

The following table provides additional information related to the allowance for loan losses for Park's Ohio-based operations, including information related to specific reserves and general reserves, at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015. 

As the table above shows, specific reserves were $4.2 million at each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. General reserves for Park s ongoing operations were $49.3 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $3.0 million, compared to $52.3 million at December 31, 2015.  The general reserve as a percentage of performing loans was 0.97% at September 30, 2016 and 1.05% at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Generally, management obtains updated valuations for all nonperforming loans, including those held at SEPH, at least annually.  As new valuation information is received, management performs an evaluation and applies a discount for anticipated disposition costs to determine the net realizable value of the collateral, which is compared against the outstanding principal balance to determine if additional write-downs are necessary.  
    
  Nonperforming Assets:   Nonperforming assets include: 1) loans whose interest is accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; 2) TDRs on accrual status; 3) loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments but whose interest continues to accrue; and (4) OREO which results from taking possession of property that served as collateral for a defaulted loan.  
    
  The following table compares Park s nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.

Park management reviews all TDRs quarterly and may classify a TDR as accruing if the borrower has been current for a period of at least six months with respect to loan payments and management expects that the borrower will be able to continue to make payments in accordance with the terms of the restructured note. At September 30, 2016, management deemed it appropriate to have $17.4 million of TDRs on accrual status, while the remaining $51.2 million of TDRs were on nonaccrual status.  Accruing TDRs as of September 30, 2016 of $17.4 million represented a $7.6 million decline from $25.0 million as of December 31, 2015.  This decline was primarily due to one $7.2 million loan relationship which was classified as an accruing TDR as of December 31, 2015 and was moved to nonaccrual status as of March 31, 2016.  Management reviews all accruing TDRs quarterly to ensure payments continue to be made in accordance with the modified terms.   
    
  Management reviews renewals/modifications of loans previously identified as TDRs to consider if it is appropriate to remove the TDR classification.  If the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty and the renewal/modification does not contain a concessionary interest rate or other concessionary terms, management considers the potential removal of the TDR classification. If deemed appropriate, the TDR classification is removed if the borrower has complied with the terms of the loan at the date of the renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the renewal/modification. The majority of these TDRs were originally considered restructurings in a prior year as a result of a renewal/modification with an interest rate that was not commensurate with the risk of the underlying loan at the time of the renewal/modification. During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, Park removed the TDR classification on $335,000 and $2.0 million, respectively of loans that met the requirements discussed above. During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, Park did not remove the TDR classification on any loans as they did not meet the requirements discussed above. 
    
  Nonperforming assets for Park's Ohio-based operations and for SEPH as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 were as reported in the following two tables:

When determining the quarterly loan loss provision, Park reviews the grades of commercial loans. These loans are graded from 1 to 8. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (graded a 1 through a 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Commercial loans graded 6 (substandard), also considered watch list credits, represent higher credit risk than those rated special mention and, as a result, a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Commercial loans that are graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonperforming and Park charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording a specific reserve. Certain 6-rated loans and all 7-rated loans are included within the impaired category.  A loan is deemed impaired when management determines that the borrower's ability to perform in accordance with the contractual loan agreement is in doubt.  Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged-off. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, Park had taken partial charge-offs of $22.2 million related to the $78.0 million of commercial loans considered to be impaired, compared to charge-offs of approximately $28.7 million related to the $80.6 million of impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2015. The table below provides additional information related to the Park impaired commercial loans at September 30, 2016, including those impaired commercial loans at PNB and those impaired Vision commercial loans retained at SEPH.

Allowance for loan losses:   Loss factors are reviewed quarterly and updated at least annually to reflect recent loan loss history and incorporate current risk and trends which may not be recognized in historical data.  Several enhancements were made in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of management's quarterly review. 

Management updated the historical loss calculation during the third quarter of 2016, incorporating annualized net charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves through September 30, 2016.  Additionally, management removed net charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Management's belief has been that historical losses should encompass the complete economic cycle.  However, given the extended length of the recovery, management determined that 2009 data was no longer reflective of the current portfolio.  Management has taken the look back period into consideration in the quarterly evaluation of environmental loss factors. 
     As part of this mid-year historical loss update, management determined that it was no longer appropriate to more heavily weight those years with higher losses in the historical loss calculation and applied equal percentages to each of the years in this calculation.  The trends that existed resulting in management applying this weighting no longer appear to exist, resulting in the adjustment back to equal weightings. 
             
    As part of the normal quarterly process, management reviewed and updated the environmental loss factors applied to the commercial portfolio in order to incorporate changes in the macroeconomic environment.  Additionally, management updated the calculation of the loss emergence period. 
     The impact of the changes as described above resulted in a decrease of $3.8 million in the ALLL at September 30, 2016, compared to what the ALLL would have been had the calculation, and related assumptions, used at June 30, 2016 remained constant. 
    
  Park s 84-month loss experience for the period ended September 30, 2016, defined as charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves, within the loan portfolio was 0.37% of the principal balance of these loans. This 84-month loss experience includes only the performance of the PNB loan portfolio and excludes the impact of PNB participations in Vision loans. The allowance for loan losses related to performing commercial loans was $32.5 million or 1.27% of the outstanding principal balance of accruing commercial loans at September 30, 2016.

     Table of Contents  

The overall reserve of 1.27% for accruing commercial loans breaks down as follows: pass-rated commercial loans are reserved at 1.25%; special mention commercial loans are reserved at 3.98%; and substandard commercial loans are reserved at 8.21%. At September 30, 2016, the coverage period within the accruing commercial portfolio was approximately 3.92 years.  The reserve levels for pass-rated, special mention and substandard commercial loans in excess of the 84-month loss experience of 0.37% are due to the following factors which management reviews on a quarterly or annual basis: 

Loss Emergence Period Factor:   At least annually, management calculates the loss emergence period for each commercial loan segment. This loss emergence period is calculated based upon the average period of time it takes from the probable occurrence of a loss event to the credit being moved to nonaccrual. If the loss emergence period for any commercial loan segment is greater than one year, management applies additional general reserves to all performing loans within that segment of the commercial loan portfolio.  The loss emergence period was last updated in the third quarter of 2016. 
                
    Loss Migration Factor:   Park s commercial loans are individually risk graded. If loan downgrades occur, the probability of default increases, and accordingly, management allocates a higher percentage reserve to those accruing commercial loans graded special mention and substandard. Annually, management calculates a loss migration factor for each commercial loan segment for special mention and substandard credits based on a review of losses over the period of time a loan takes to migrate from pass-rated to impaired. 
                
    Environmental Loss Factor:   Management has identified certain macroeconomic factors that trend in accordance with losses in Park s commercial loan portfolio. These macroeconomic factors are reviewed quarterly and the adjustments made to the environmental loss factor impacting each segment in the performing commercial loan portfolio correlate to changes in the macroeconomic environment. 
     Generally, consumer loans are not individually graded. Consumer loans include: (1) mortgage and installment loans included in the construction real estate segment of the loan portfolio; (2) mortgage, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), and installment loans included in the residential real estate segment of the loan portfolio; and (3) all loans included in the consumer segment of the loan portfolio. The amount of loan loss reserve assigned to these loans is based on historical loss experience over the past 81 months, through September 30, 2016. Management generally considers a one-year coverage period (the  Historical Loss Factor ) appropriate because the probable loss on any given loan in the consumer loan pool should ordinarily become apparent in that time frame. However, management may incorporate adjustments to the Historical Loss Factor as circumstances warrant additional reserves (e.g., increased loan delinquencies, improving or deteriorating economic conditions, changes in lending management and underwriting standards, etc.). At September 30, 2016, the coverage period within the consumer portfolio was approximately 1.94 years. 
    
  The judgmental increases discussed above incorporate management s evaluation of the impact of environmental qualitative factors which pose additional risks and assignment of a component of the allowance for loan losses in consideration of these factors. Such environmental factors include: global, national and local economic trends and conditions; experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures; and levels of, and trends in, consumer bankruptcies, delinquencies, impaired loans and charge-offs and recoveries. The determination of this component of the allowance for loan losses requires considerable management judgment. Actual loss experience may be more or less than the amount allocated.

Salaries increased by $392,000, or 1.8%, to $22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $21.7 million for the same period in 2015.  The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense related to the 2013 Incentive Plan of $165,000 and an increase of $146,000 in incentive compensation, compared to the same period of 2015. Salaries increased by $1.2 million, or 1.9%, to $64.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $63.7 million for the same period in 2015. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense related to the 2013 Incentive Plan of $486,000, an increase in incentive compensation expense of $187,000, and an increase in salaries expense of $522,000, compared to the same period of 2015. 
    
  Employee benefit expenses decreased by $1.6 million, or 24.5%, to $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2015. Employee benefit expenses decreased by $2.4 million, or 14.0%, to $14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $17.1 million for the same period in 2015.  The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in medical expenses compared to the same period in 2015.  
    
  Furniture and equipment expense increased by $393,000, or 12.9%, to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2015. It increased $1.6 million, or 17.8%, to $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $196,000 increase in depreciation expense and a $222,000 increase in maintenance expense. The increase for the first nine months was primarily due to a $873,000 increase in depreciation expense and a $726,000 increase in maintenance expense.    
    
  Professional fees and services increased by $932,000, or 17.2%, to $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was related to an increase of $575,000 in management and consulting expenses, $211,000 in credit services expense and $155,000 in legal expenses. Professional fees and services increased by $2.7 million, or 17.3%, to $18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was largely related to an increase of $909,000 related to legal expenses, $842,000 related to management and consulting expenses and an increase of $609,000 in other miscellaneous fees related to software and services. 
    
  Miscellaneous expense decreased by $899,000, or 40.6%, to $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.2 million for the same period of 2015.  The decrease of $899,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly related to a decrease of $520,000 in OREO related expenses, and a decrease of $309,000 in the amortization of historic tax credits.

Miscellaneous expense increased by $459,000, or 6.1%, to $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.6 million for the same period in 2015. The $459,000 increase for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in accruals due to the ongoing evaluation of litigation and other proceedings impacting the GFSC subsidiary and the Parent Company, a $1.5 million increase in contribution expense and a $907,000 increase in non-loan losses, offset by a reduction in expenses as $1.1 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2015 related to a prepayment penalty on borrowings and a contract termination fee, a $870,000 reduction in expense related to reserves established for potential mortgage loan repurchases, a $718,000 reduction in OREO related expenses and a decrease of $617,000 related to the amortization of historic tax credits. 
    
  Income Tax 
    
  Federal income tax expense was $12.2 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2015. The effective federal income tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 30.8%, compared to 28.6% for the same period in 2015. Federal income tax expense was $28.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $24.4 million for the first nine months of 2015. The effective federal income tax rate for the first nine months months of 2016 was 29.9%, compared to 28.9% for the same period in 2015. The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% and Park s effective tax rate is due to the permanent tax differences, primarily consisting of tax-exempt interest income from investments and loans, the tax benefit of investments in qualified affordable housing projects, federal historic preservation tax credits, bank owned life insurance income, and dividends paid on the common shares held within Park s salary deferral plan. Park expects permanent tax differences for the 2016 year will be approximately $6.2 million.  
    
  Park and its Ohio-based affiliates do not pay state income taxes to the state of Ohio, but Park pays a franchise tax based on Park's year-end equity. The franchise tax expense is included in  state taxes  as part of other expense on Park s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income.

Comparison of Financial Condition 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 
    
  Changes in Financial Condition 
    
  Total assets increased by $52.7 million, or 0.7%, to $7,364 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $7,311 million at December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the following: 

Total liabilities increased by $15.0 million, or 0.2%, during the first nine months of 2016 to $6,613 million at September 30, 2016, from $6,598 million at December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the following: 

Total shareholders  equity increased by $37.7 million, or 5.3%, to $751.1 million at September 30, 2016, from $713.4 million at December 31, 2015.  

Retained earnings increased by $22.7 million during the period as a result of net income of $66.1 million, offset by common share dividends of $43.5 million.  
       
  Increases or decreases in the investment securities portfolio, short-term borrowings and long-term debt are greatly dependent upon the growth in loans and deposits. The primary objective of management is to grow loan and deposit totals. To the extent that management is unable to grow loan totals at a desired growth rate, additional investment securities may be acquired. Likewise, both short-term borrowings and long-term debt are utilized to fund the growth in earning assets if the growth in deposits and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to do so. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents increased by $90.5 million to $240.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $149.5 million at December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was $57.8 million and $53.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  Cash provided by investing activities was $80.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cash used by investing activities was $135.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Proceeds from the sale, repayment, or maturity of securities provide cash and purchases of securities use cash.  Net securities transactions provided cash of $191.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Another major use or source of cash in investing activities is the net increase or decrease in the loan portfolio.  Cash used by the net increase in the loan portfolio was $109.1 million and $175.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively   
  Cash used in financing activities was $47.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cash provided by financing activities was $226.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  A major source of cash for financing activities is the net change in deposits.  Deposits increased and provided $172.0 million and $327.0 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Another major source of cash for financing is short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net short-term borrowings decreased and used $176.0 million in cash and net long-term borrowings did not change.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net short-term borrowings increased and provided $1.3 million and net long-term borrowings declined and used $54.5 million in cash.

Finally, cash declined by $43.2 million and $43.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the payment of dividends.  
  Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of the Corporation, are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, the capability to securitize or package loans for sale, and a $10.0 million revolving line of credit with another financial institution, which did not have an outstanding balance as of September 30, 2016. The Corporation s loan to asset ratio was 70.44% at September 30, 2016, compared to 69.32% at December 31, 2015 and 68.49% at September 30, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents were $240.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $149.5 million at December 31, 2015 and $382.3 million at September 30, 2015. Management believes that the present funding sources provide more than adequate liquidity for the Corporation to meet its cash flow needs. 
     
  Capital Resources 
    
  Shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 was $751.1 million, or 10.2% of total assets, compared to $713.4 million, or 9.8% of total assets, at December 31, 2015 and $715.8 million, or 9.8% of total assets, at September 30, 2015.  
    
  Financial institution regulators have established guidelines for minimum capital ratios for banks, thrifts and bank holding companies. Park has elected not to include the net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale securities in computing regulatory capital.  During the first quarter of 2015, Park adopted the Basel III regulatory capital framework as approved by the federal banking agencies.  The adoption of this framework modified the calculation of the various capital ratios, added a new ratio, common equity tier 1, and revised the adequately and well capitalized thresholds.  Additionally, under the Basel III rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, Park must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios.  The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019.  The capital conservation buffer for 2016 is 0.625%.  The amounts shown below as the adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer includes the fully phased-in 2.50% buffer. 
    
  PNB met each of the well capitalized ratio guidelines at September 30, 2016. The following table indicates the capital ratios for PNB and Park at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  In the ordinary course of operations, Park enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include the funding of operations through debt issuances as well as leases for premises. See page 41 of Park s 2015 Annual Report (Table 36) for disclosure concerning contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015. There were no significant changes in contractual obligations and commitments during the first nine months of 2016.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
    
  PNB is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The exposure to credit loss (for PNB) in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. PNB uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Since many of the loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers. 
    
  The total amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk were as follows:

ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Management reviews interest rate sensitivity on a monthly basis by modeling the consolidated financial statements under various interest rate scenarios. The primary reason for these efforts is to guard Park from adverse impacts of unforeseen changes in interest rates. Management continues to believe that further changes in interest rates will have a small impact on net income, consistent with the disclosure on page 40 of Park s 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  On page 40 (Table 35) of Park s 2015 Annual Report, management reported that Park s twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap was a positive (assets exceeding liabilities) $407 million or 6.03% of interest earning assets at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, Park s twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap was a positive (assets exceeding liabilities) $656 million or 9.69% of interest earning assets. 
    
  Management supplements the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis with periodic simulations of balance sheet sensitivity under various interest rate and what-if scenarios to better forecast and manage the net interest margin. Management uses a 50 basis point change in market interest rates per quarter for a total of 200 basis points per year in evaluating the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and net income over a twelve-month horizon. 
    
  On page 40 of Park s 2015 Annual Report, management reported that at December 31, 2015, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 0.4% using a rising interest rate scenario and decrease by 10.9% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. At September 30, 2016, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 0.2% using a rising interest rate scenario and would decrease by 8.9% in a declining interest rate scenario. At September 30, 2016, management continues to believe that gradual changes in interest rates (50 basis points per quarter for a total of 200 basis points per year) will have a small impact on net income. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and President (the principal executive officer) and the Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer (the principal financial officer) of Park, Park s management has evaluated the effectiveness of Park s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, Park s Chief Executive Officer and President and Park s Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer have concluded that: 

information required to be disclosed by Park in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports that Park files or submits under the Exchange Act would be accumulated and communicated to Park s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; 
                
    information required to be disclosed by Park in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other reports that Park files or submits under the Exchange Act would be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and 
                
    Park s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
       
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in Park s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-5(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during Park s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Park s internal control over financial reporting.
