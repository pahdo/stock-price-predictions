 NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include ChoiceOne
Financial Services, Inc. ( ChoiceOne ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ChoiceOne Bank (the  Bank ), and
the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, ChoiceOne Insurance Agencies, Inc. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

The unaudited condensed financial statements have been
prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures
normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the company believes that the disclosures made are adequate
to make the information not misleading. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect
all adjustments ordinary in nature which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three- and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three- and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders  Equity
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in ChoiceOne s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Allowance for Loan Losses  

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level
believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management s
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, assessments of the impact of current
economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience of seasoned loan portfolios. See Note 3 to the interim consolidated
financial statements for additional information. 

Management believes the accounting estimate related to
the allowance for loan losses is a  critical accounting estimate  because (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to
change from period to period because of assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios and economic
conditions and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on ChoiceOne s assets
reported on the balance sheets as well as its net income. 

Stock Transactions  

A total of 4,112 shares of common stock were issued to
ChoiceOne s Board of Directors for a cash price of $95,000 under the terms of the Directors  Stock Purchase Plan in
the first nine months of 2016. A total of 4,793 shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options in the first
three quarters of 2016. A total of 2,654 shares of common stock were issued to employees for a cash price of $51,000 under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the first nine months of 2016. A total of 3,414 shares of common stock were issued to employees
upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units during the first three quarters of 2016. A total of 35,000 shares of common stock were repurchased
by ChoiceOne in the first nine months of 2016. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

Effective July 1, 2013, ChoiceOne began granting Restricted
Stock Units to a select group of employees under the Stock Incentive Plan of 2012. All of the Restricted Stock Units are initially
unvested and vest in three annual installments on each of the next three anniversaries of the grant date. Certain additional vesting
provisions apply. Each unit, once vested, is settled by issuance of one share of ChoiceOne common stock.

NOTE 2 - SECURITIES  

The fair value of securities available for sale and the
related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows: 

8  

Contractual maturities of securities available for
sale at September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

Securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and year-end 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, were as follows: 

ChoiceOne reviews its securities portfolio on a quarterly
basis to determine whether unrealized losses are considered to be temporary or other-than-temporary. No other-than-temporary impairment
charges were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. ChoiceOne believed that unrealized losses on securities
were temporary in nature and were due to changes in interest rates and reduced market liquidity and not as a result of credit quality
issues. 

9  

NOTE 3   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR
LOAN LOSSES  

 Activity in the allowance for loan losses
and balances in the loan portfolio were as follows: 

10   

The process to monitor the credit quality
of ChoiceOne s loan portfolio includes tracking (1) the risk ratings of business loans, (2) the level of classified business
loans, and (3) delinquent and nonperforming consumer loans. Business loans are risk rated on a scale of 1 to 8. A description of
the characteristics of the ratings follows: 

Risk ratings 1 and 2: These loans are considered
pass credits. They exhibit good to exceptional credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan from normal business operations. 

Risk rating 3: These loans are considered
pass credits. They exhibit acceptable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan from normal business operations. 

Risk rating 4: These loans are considered
pass credits. However, they have potential developing weaknesses that, if not corrected, may cause deterioration in the ability
of the borrower to repay the loan. While a loss is possible for a loan with this rating, it is not anticipated. 

Risk rating 5: These loans are considered
special mention credits. Loans in this risk rating are considered to be inadequately protected by the net worth and debt service
coverage of the borrower or of any pledged collateral. These loans have well defined weaknesses that may jeopardize the borrower s
ability to repay the loan. If the weaknesses are not corrected, loss of principal and interest could be probable. 

Risk rating 6: These loans are considered
substandard credits. These loans have well defined weaknesses, the severity of which makes collection of principal and interest
in full, questionable. Loans in this category may be placed on nonaccrual status. 

Risk rating 7: These loans are considered
doubtful credits. Some loss of principal and interest has been determined to be probable. The estimate of the amount of loss could
be affected by factors such as the borrower s ability to provide additional capital or collateral. Loans in this category
are on nonaccrual status. 

Risk rating 8: These loans are considered
loss credits. They are considered uncollectible and will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses. 

Information regarding the Bank s credit exposure is as

The following schedule provides information
on loans that were considered TDRs that were modified during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015: 

The pre-modification and post-modification
outstanding recorded investment represents amounts as of the date of loan modification. If a difference exists between the pre-modification
and post-modification outstanding recorded investment, it represents impairment recognized through the provision for loan losses
computed based on a loan s post-modification present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original
effective interest rate. If no difference exists, a loss is not expected to be incurred based on an assessment of the borrower s
expected cash flows. 

The following schedule provides information
on TDRs as of September 30, 2016 where the borrower was past due with respect to principal and/or interest for 30 days or more
during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 that had been modified during the year prior to the default: 

The following schedule provides information
on TDRs as of September 30, 2015 where the borrower was past due with respect to principal and/or interest for 30 days or more
during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 that had been modified during the year prior to the default: 

Loans are classified as performing when
they are current as to principal and interest payments or are past due on payments less than 90 days. Loans are classified as nonperforming
when they are past due 90 days or more as to principal and interest payments or are considered a troubled debt restructuring.

NOTE 4 - EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Earnings per share are based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period. A computation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share
follows: 

There were 30,000 stock options as of
September 30, 2016 and zero stock options as of September 30, 2015, that were considered to be anti-dilutive to earnings per share
for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These stock options have been excluded from the
calculation above. 

16   

NOTE 5   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Financial instruments as of the dates indicated were as follows: 

The estimated fair values approximate the
carrying amounts for all assets and liabilities except those described later in this paragraph. The methodology for determining
the estimated fair value for securities available for sale is described in Note 6. The estimated fair value for loans is based
on the rates charged at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for new loans with similar maturities, applied until the loan
is assumed to reprice or be paid off. The allowance for loan losses is considered to be a reasonable estimate of discount for credit
quality concerns. The estimated fair values for time deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances are based
on the rates paid at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for new deposits or FHLB advances, applied until maturity. The estimated
fair values for other financial instruments and off-balance sheet loan commitments are considered nominal. 

17   

NOTE 6   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The following tables present information
about the Bank s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the valuation techniques used by
the Bank to determine those fair values. 

In general, fair values determined by Level
1 inputs use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Bank has the ability to access. 

Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs
use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets, and other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted
intervals. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs,
including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the related asset or liability. 

In instances where inputs used to measure
fair value fall into different levels in the above fair value hierarchy, fair value measurements in their entirety are categorized
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation. The Bank s assessment of the significance of particular
inputs to these fair value measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each asset or liability. 

There were no liabilities measured at fair
value as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Disclosures concerning assets measured at fair value are as follows: 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring
Basis  

18   

Changes in Level 3 Assets Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  

Of the Level 3 assets that were held by
the Bank at September 30, 2016, the net unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $131,000, which is recognized
in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet. Purchases of Level 3 securities during the first three quarters
of 2016 and 2015 consisted of local municipal issues. During the first nine months of 2016, $5.1 million of Level 3 securities
were purchased. There were no sales of Level 3 securities in the first nine months of 2016. 

Both observable and unobservable inputs
may be used to determine the fair value of positions classified as Level 3 investment securities and liabilities. As a result,
the unrealized gains and losses for these assets and liabilities presented in the tables above may include changes in fair value
that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. 

Available for sale investment securities
categorized as Level 3 assets primarily consist of bonds issued by local municipalities. The Bank estimates the fair value of these
bonds based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management s best estimate of key assumptions, including
forecasted interest yield and payment rates, credit quality and a discount rate commensurate with the current market and other
risks involved. 

The Bank also has assets that under certain
conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not normally measured at fair value,
but can be subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as impairment. Disclosures concerning assets measured
at fair value on a non-recurring basis are as follows: 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring
Basis 

Impaired loans categorized as Level 3 assets
consist of non-homogeneous loans that are considered impaired. The Bank estimates the fair value of the loans based on the present
value of expected future cash flows using management s estimate of key assumptions. These assumptions include future payment
ability, timing of payment streams, and estimated realizable values of available collateral (typically based on outside appraisals).
The changes in fair value consisted of charge-downs of impaired loans that were posted to the allowance for loan losses and write-downs
of other real estate that were posted to a valuation account. 

19   

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

The following discussion is designed to provide a review
of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc. ( ChoiceOne )
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ChoiceOne Bank (the  Bank ), and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, ChoiceOne
Insurance Agencies, Inc. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim consolidated financial statements and related
notes. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This discussion and other sections of this quarterly
report contain forward-looking statements that are based on management s beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates
and projections about the financial services industry, the economy, and ChoiceOne itself. Words such as  anticipates, 
 believes,   estimates,   expects,   forecasts,   intends,   is likely, 
 plans,   predicts,   projects,   may,   could,  and variations of such words
and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Management s determination of the provision
and allowance for loan losses, the carrying value of goodwill and loan servicing rights, the fair value of investment securities
(including whether any impairment on any investment security is temporary or other-than-temporary and the amount of any impairment)
and management s assumptions concerning pension and other postretirement benefit plans involve judgments that are inherently
forward-looking. All of the information concerning interest rate sensitivity is forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees
of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions ( risk factors ) that are difficult to
predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood, and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially
differ from what may be expressed, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Furthermore, ChoiceOne undertakes
no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or
otherwise. 

Risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risk
factors discussed in Item 1A of ChoiceOne s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These are representative
of the risk factors that could cause a difference between an ultimate actual outcome and a preceding forward-looking statement. 

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS  

Summary  

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $1,683,000,
which represented an increase of $233,000 or 16.1% compared to the same period in 2015. Net income for the first nine months of
2016 was $4,402,000, which represented a decrease of $121,000 or 2.7% compared to the same period in 2015. Increases in net interest
income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 compared
to the third quarter of 2015. Basic earnings per common share were $0.52 for the third quarter and $1.34 for the first nine months
of 2016, compared to $0.44 and $1.37, respectively, for the same periods in 2015. Diluted earnings per common share were the same
during the time periods noted. The return on average assets and return on average shareholders  equity percentages were 1.01%
and 8.15%, respectively, for the first three quarters of 2016, compared to 1.10% and 8.86%, respectively, for the same periods
in 2015. 

Dividends  

Cash dividends of $551,000 or $0.17 per share were declared
in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $559,000 or $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The cash dividends declared
in the first nine months of 2016 were $1,674,000 or $0.51 per share, compared to $1,610,000 or $0.49 per share declared in the
same period in 2015. The cash dividend payout percentage was 38.0% for the first nine months of 2016 and 35.6% for the first nine
months of 2015. 

Interest Income and Expense  

Tables 1 and 2 on the following pages provide information
regarding interest income and expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Table 1 documents ChoiceOne s
average balances and interest income and expense, as well as the average rates earned or paid on assets and liabilities. Table
2 documents the effect on interest income and expense of changes in volume (average balance) and interest rates. These tables are
referred to in the discussion of interest income, interest expense and net interest income. 

20  

Table 1   Average Balances and Tax-Equivalent Interest Rates   

(1) 
     Adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to facilitate comparison to the taxable interest-earning assets. The adjustment uses an incremental tax rate of 34% for the periods presented.  

(2) 
     Includes the effect of unrealized gains or losses on securities.  

(3) 
     Taxable securities include dividend income from Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock.  

21  

Table 2   Changes in Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income   

(1) 
     The volume variance is computed as the change in volume (average balance) multiplied by the previous year s interest rate.  The rate variance is computed as the change in interest rate multiplied by the previous year s volume (average balance).  The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated to the volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.  

(2) 
     Interest on nontaxable investment securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis using an incremental tax rate of 34% for the periods presented.  

Net Interest Income  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, net interest income was $14,401,000 and $13,694,000, respectively, and net interest income on a tax-equivalent
basis was $14,964,000 and $14,248,000, respectively. 

The presentation of net interest income
on a tax-equivalent basis is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), but is customary
in the banking industry. This non-GAAP measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt
loans and investment securities. The adjustments to determine net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis were $563,000 and
$554,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These adjustments were computed using a 34% federal
income tax rate. For a reconciliation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, Table 1 - Average Balances and Tax-Equivalent
Interest Rates. 

As shown in Tables 1 and 2, tax-equivalent net interest
income increased $716,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The relationship between growth
in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities caused net interest income to increase $1,055,000 in
the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. A decrease of 6 basis points in the net interest
spread from 3.75% in the first nine months of 2015 to 3.69% in the first nine months of 2016 resulted in a $339,000 decrease in
net interest income. 

The average balance of loans increased $16.1 million
in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Average commercial loans increased $11.9 million and average
residential mortgage loans increased $3.9 million in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The
average interest rate earned on loans declined 8 basis points from the first nine months of 2015 to the same period in 2016. This
was the result of existing loan renewals and new loan production at lower rates than in the existing portfolio. The increase in
the average loans balance partially offset by the decrease in the average rate earned caused tax-equivalent interest income from
loans to increase $348,000 in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The average balance
of total securities grew $19.9 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Additional securities
were purchased during the first nine months of 2016 to provide earning asset growth. Growth in average securities, partially offset
by the effect of a 5 basis point decline in interest rates earned caused tax-equivalent interest income to increase $334,000 in
the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

22  

The average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits
increased $34.3 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The effect of the higher average
balance, offset by a 1 basis point decline in the average rate paid, caused interest expense to increase $27,000 in the first three
quarters of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The average balance of savings deposits increased $5.3 million in the first
nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The impact of the savings deposit growth offset by a 1 basis
point decrease in the average rate paid caused interest expense to decrease $3,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to
the same period in 2015. The average balance of certificates of deposit was down $9.6 million in the first nine months of 2016
compared to the same period in 2015. The decline in certificates of deposit plus a 7 basis point reduction in the average rate
paid on certificates caused interest expense to fall $88,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
A $4.1 million increase in the average balance and a 22 basis point increase in the average rate paid caused interest expense from
Federal Home Loan Bank advances to increase $55,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.
A decrease of $12.8 million in the average balance of other interest-bearing liabilities in the first nine months of 2016 compared
to the first nine months of 2015 and the effect of a 6 basis point decrease in the average rate paid caused a $21,000 decrease
in other interest expense. 

The reduction in the average rate earned on interest-earning
assets was caused by relatively low general market rates which affected new loan originations and securities purchases in the first
nine months of 2016. Interest rates on loans are also being impacted by rate pressure from some of ChoiceOne s competing
financial institutions. The lower rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities resulted from repricing of local deposits as general
market interest rates remained low during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016. If market interest rates continue to remain low,
ChoiceOne s net interest spread may continue to decrease in future quarters. 

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses  

Total loans increased $13.3 million while the allowance
for loan losses increased $82,000 from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The provision for loan losses was $0 in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2016, compared to $0 and $100,000, respectively, in the same periods in 2015. Nonperforming loans
were $5.6 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $6.0 million as of June 30, 2016 and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2015.
The allowance for loan losses was 1.18% of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to 1.20% at June 30, 2016 and 1.20% at December
31, 2015. 

Charge-offs and recoveries for respective loan categories
for the nine months ended September 30 were as follows: 

Net charge-offs were $20,000 in the third quarter of
2016 and net recoveries of $82,000 were experienced in the first nine months of 2016, compared to net charge-offs of $35,000 in
the third quarter of 2015 and net recoveries of $44,000 in the first nine months of 2015. Management is aware that the economic
climate in Michigan will continue to affect business and personal borrowers. Management has worked and intends to continue to work
with delinquent borrowers in an attempt to lessen the negative impact to ChoiceOne. As charge-offs, changes in the level of nonperforming
loans, and changes within the composition of the loan portfolio occur in the remainder of 2016, the provision and allowance for
loan losses will be reviewed by the Bank s management and adjusted as believed to be necessary. 

23  

Noninterest Income  

Total noninterest income increased $105,000 in the third
quarter of 2016 and decreased $145,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. A decrease in customer
service charges of $62,000 in the third quarter and $117,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in the
prior year was due to lower overdraft fees and fees from deposit account charges. Insurance and investment commissions increased
$71,000 in the third quarter of 2016, but have decreased $112,000 in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same periods
in 2015. The decline in the first nine months of 2016 was caused by lower commissions from sales of real estate investment trusts.
Gains on loan sales increased $200,000 in the third quarter and $225,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same
periods in 2015. While residential mortgage refinancing activity has slowed in 2016, purchase activity has increased which has
caused the increase. A decrease of $127,000 in the third quarter and an increase of $47,000 in the first nine months of 2016 in
gains on sales of securities when compared to the same periods in 2015 resulted from less sales activity in the third quarter of
2016 than in the same period of the prior year. A death benefit of $308,000 received on a bank owned life insurance policy in the
first quarter of 2015 caused a decrease in earnings on life insurance policies in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to
the same period in 2015. 

Noninterest Expense  

Total noninterest expense increased $67,000 in the third
quarter of 2016 and $721,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase of $219,000 in
salaries and benefits in the third quarter of 2016 and $684,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in
2015 resulted in part from higher salaries driven by the new loan production office and stock compensation expense. Professional
fees decreased $31,000 in the third quarter of 2016 and $76,000 in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same periods
in 2015 because of decreased consulting fees. 

Income Tax Expense  

Income tax expense was $1,591,000 in the first nine months
of 2016 compared to $1,529,000 for the same period in 2015. The effective tax rate was 26.5% and 25.3%, respectively, for the first
nine months of 2016 and 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the effect of a $308,000
nontaxable death benefit received in the first quarter of 2015 from a bank owned life insurance policy. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Securities   

The securities available for sale portfolio increased
$2.3 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $17.3 million in the first nine months of 2016. Various securities totaling $63.8
million were purchased in the first nine months of 2016 to provide earning assets and to replace maturities, principal repayments,
and calls within the securities portfolio. Approximately $31.6 million in various securities were called or matured since the end
of 2015. Principal repayments on securities totaled $1.8 million in the first nine months of 2016. Approximately $14.5 million
of securities were sold in the first three quarters of 2016 for a net gain of $255,000. 

Loans  

The loan portfolio (excluding loans held for sale) increased
$5.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and increased $13.3 million in the first nine months of 2016. Agricultural loans increased
$3.6 million in the third quarter, but declined $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2016. Commercial and industrial loans
declined $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 but grew $1.3 million in the first three quarters of 2016. Consumer loans increased
$544,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. Commercial real estate loans increased
$2.8 million in the third quarter and $11.3 in the first three quarters of 2016. Residential real estate loans declined $683,000
and grew $598 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. The environment for loan originations in ChoiceOne s
market area has become increasingly competitive. 

24  

Asset Quality  

 Information regarding impaired loans
can be found in Note 3 to the interim consolidated financial statements included in this report. The total balance of loans classified
as impaired was $5.6 million at September 30, 2016, $6.0 million as of June 30, 2016 and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2015.
The balance of commercial real estate loans classified as impaired has declined $1.3 million in the first nine months of 2016.
This decline is offset by increases in impaired loans in the other loan categories. 

As part of its review of the loan portfolio, management
also monitors the various nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans are comprised of: (1) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis;
(2) loans, not included in nonaccrual loans, which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments;
and (3) loans, not included in nonaccrual or loans past due 90 days or more, which are considered troubled debt restructurings. 

The balances of these nonperforming loans were as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, nonaccrual loans included $489,000
in agricultural loans, $320,000 in commercial and industrial loans, $471,000 in commercial real estate loans, and $454,000 in residential
real estate loans. At December 31, 2015, nonaccrual loans included $50,000 in agricultural loans, $77,000 in commercial and industrial
loans, $1.6 million in commercial real estate loans, and $431,000 in residential real estate loans. The decrease in nonaccrual
loans was primarily due to credits paid off during the first nine months of 2016. Management believes the allowance allocated to
its nonperforming loans was sufficient at September 30, 2016. 

Deposits and Borrowings  

Total deposits increased $13.6 million in the third quarter
of 2016 and increased $2.7 million since the end of 2015. Checking and savings deposits increased $15.2 million in the third quarter
of 2016 and $0.7 million in the first nine months of 2016. Money market deposits increased $1.4 million in the third quarter of
2016 and increased $5.6 million in the first nine months of 2016. Local certificates of deposit decreased $3.0 million in the third
quarter of 2016 and $3.6 million in the first nine months of 2016. ChoiceOne continued to place an emphasis on building its core
deposits base in 2016. 

An increase in federal funds purchased of $624,000 since
December 31, 2015 was used to fund short term liquidity needs of the Bank. Repurchase agreements have declined by $3.0 million
in the first nine months of 2016 due to normal fluctuations in funds provided by bank customers. Management plans to continue this
practice as a low-cost source of funding. Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $26.0 million in the first nine months of 2016
to fund both loans and growth in the securities portfolio. 

Shareholders  Equity  

Total shareholders  equity increased $3.7 million from
December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Growth in equity resulted from current year s net income, proceeds from the issuance
of ChoiceOne stock and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income offset by cash dividends paid and repurchases of shares.
The $1.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income since the end of 2015 was caused by an increase in net unrealized
gains on available for sale securities. The change in unrealized gains resulted from decreases in mid- and short-term rates in
2016, which increased the market value of the Bank s securities. 

25   

Following is information regarding the Bank s compliance
with regulatory capital requirements: 

Management reviews the capital levels of ChoiceOne and
the Bank on a regular basis. The Board of Directors (the  Board ) and management believe that the capital levels as
of September 30, 2016 are adequate for the foreseeable future. The Board s determination of appropriate cash dividends for
future periods will be based on, among other things, market conditions and ChoiceOne s requirements for cash and capital. 

Liquidity  

Net cash provided from operating activities was $8.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.8 million provided in the same period a year ago. Higher proceeds
from loan sales were partially offset by a higher balance of loans originated for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was
$30.6 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $9.5 million in the same period in 2015. The change was due to additional
net securities purchases offset by security sales and maturities and due to a higher level of loan growth than in the prior year.
Net cash provided from financing activities was $23.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.4 million
in the same period in the prior year. A decline in the level of deposit growth in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015 was offset by a smaller decrease in the balance of repurchase agreements in 2016 than in 2015 and growth in
Federal Home Loan Bank advances in 2016 in contrast with a decline in the prior year. 

Management believes that the current level of liquidity
is sufficient to meet the Bank s normal operating needs. This belief is based upon the availability of deposits from both the local
and national markets, maturities of securities, normal loan repayments, income retention, federal funds purchased from correspondent
banks, and advances available from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Bank also has a secured line of credit available from the Federal
Reserve Bank. 

26   

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures . 

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of ChoiceOne s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ChoiceOne s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on and as of the
time of that evaluation, ChoiceOne s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded
that ChoiceOne s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that ChoiceOne files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that ChoiceOne files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including ChoiceOne s principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in ChoiceOne s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected,
or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, ChoiceOne s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER
INFORMATION   

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings . 

There are no material pending legal proceedings to which
ChoiceOne or the Bank is a party or to which any of their properties are subject, except for proceedings that arose in the ordinary
course of business. In the belief of management, pending or current legal proceedings should not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial condition of ChoiceOne. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors . 

Information concerning risk factors is contained in the
discussion in Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  in ChoiceOne s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. 

Item 2.   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds . 

On July 26, 2016 ChoiceOne issued 808 shares of common
stock, without par value, to the directors of ChoiceOne pursuant to the Directors  Stock Purchase Plan for an aggregate cash
price of $19,000. ChoiceOne relied on the exemption contained in Section 4(a)(5) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with
these sales.
