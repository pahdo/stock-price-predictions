  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

1. 
    Accounting Policies and Interim Results 
       
  The Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with BNSF Railway Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , including the financial statements and notes thereto. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BNSF Railway Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries, all of which are separate legal entities (collectively, BNSF Railway or the Company). BNSF Railway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF), and is the principal operating subsidiary of BNSF. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   
    
  On February 12, 2010, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation (Berkshire), acquired   100%   of the outstanding shares of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation common stock that it did not already own. The acquisition was completed through the merger (Merger) of a Berkshire wholly-owned merger subsidiary and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation with the surviving entity renamed Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC. Earnings per share data is not presented because BNSF Railway has only one holder of its common stock. 
    
  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the entire year. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, except as disclosed) necessary for a fair statement of BNSF Railway s consolidated financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

2. 
    Accounts Receivable, Net 
       
  Accounts receivable, net consists of freight and other receivables, reduced by an allowance for bill adjustments and uncollectible accounts, based upon expected collectibility. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , $  88 million   and $  73 million  , respectively, of such allowances had been recorded. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , $  63 million   and $  48 million  , respectively, of accounts receivable were greater than 90 days old. 

3. 
    Investments 
       
  BNSF Railway holds investments which are classified as trading securities and included in Other Assets on the balance sheet. The following table summarizes the fair value of investments held as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions): 

The fair value measurements of BNSF Railway s debt securities are based on Level 2 inputs and equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs, using a market approach. The following table presents gains and losses recognized in earnings for the Company (in millions):

  Intangible assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions): 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , intangible assets primarily consisted of franchise and customer assets. Intangible liabilities primarily consisted of customer and shortline contracts which were in an unfavorable position at the date of Merger. 
    
  Amortizable intangible assets and liabilities are amortized based on the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be consumed or on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. 
    
  Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities was as follows (in millions): 

Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities for the next five years is expected to approximate the following (in millions):

5. 
    Other Assets 
       
  In July 2010, the Company entered into a low-income housing partnership (the Partnership) as the limited partner, holding a   99.9%   interest in the Partnership. The Partnership is a variable interest entity (VIE), with the purpose of developing and operating low-income housing rental properties. Recovery of the Company s investment is accomplished through the utilization of low-income housing tax credits and the tax benefits of Partnership losses. The general partner, who holds a   0.1%   interest in the Partnership, is an unrelated third party and is responsible for controlling and managing the business and financial operation of the Partnership. As the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Partnership s economic performance, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and therefore, does not consolidate the Partnership. The Company does not provide financial support to the Partnership that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. 
       
  The Company has accounted for its investment in the Partnership using the effective yield method. The risk of loss of the Company's investment in the Partnership is considered low as an affiliate of the general partner has provided certain guarantees of tax credits and minimum annual returns. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized a reduction to income tax expense of $  31 million   and $  27 million  , respectively. The Company s maximum exposure to loss related to the Partnership is the unamortized investment balance. The following table provides information related to this Partnership (in millions): 

Fair Value of Debt Instruments 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of BNSF Railway's debt, excluding capital leases, was $  1,207 million   and $  1,145 million  , respectively, while the book value, which also excludes capital leases and the associated unamortized fair value adjustment under acquisition method accounting related to capital leases, was $  1,038 million   and $  1,092 million  , respectively. The fair value of BNSF Railway's debt is primarily based on market value price models using observable market-based data for the same or similar issues, or on the estimated rates that would be offered to BNSF Railway for debt of the same remaining maturities (Level 2 inputs).

  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. 
    
  Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BNSF Railway, has a guarantee in connection with its remaining special limited partnership interest in Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners, L.P. (SFPP), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., to be paid only upon default by the partnership. All obligations with respect to the guarantee will cease upon termination of ownership rights, which would occur upon a put notice issued by BNSF Railway or the exercise of the call rights by the general partners of SFPP. 
    
  Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP 
    
  BNSF Railway has an indemnity agreement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips), granting certain rights of indemnity from BNSF Railway, in order to facilitate access to a new storage facility. Under certain circumstances, payment under this obligation may be required in the event Chevron Phillips were to incur certain liabilities or other incremental costs resulting from trackage access. 
    
  Indemnities 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, BNSF Railway enters into agreements with third parties that include indemnification clauses. The Company believes that these clauses are generally customary for the types of agreements in which they are included. At times, these clauses may involve indemnification for the acts of the Company, its employees and agents, indemnification for another party s acts, indemnification for future events, indemnification based upon a certain standard of performance, indemnification for liabilities arising out of the Company s use of leased equipment or other property, or other types of indemnification. Despite the uncertainty whether events which would trigger the indemnification obligations would ever occur, the Company does not believe that these indemnity agreements will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additionally, the Company believes that, due to lack of historical payment experience, the fair value of indemnities cannot be estimated with any amount of certainty and that the fair value of any such amount would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Agreements that reflect unique circumstances, particularly agreements that contain guarantees that indemnify for another party s acts, are disclosed separately, if appropriate. Unless separately disclosed above, no fair value liability related to indemnities has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

Variable Interest Entities - Leases 
    
  BNSF Railway has entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the lease contains VIEs. These leases are primarily for equipment.  These VIEs were created solely for the lease transactions and have no other activities, assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions. In some of the arrangements, BNSF Railway has the option to purchase some or all of the leased assets at a fixed price, thereby creating variable interests for BNSF Railway in the VIEs. The future minimum lease payments associated with the VIE leases were approximately $  2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  In the event the leased asset is destroyed, BNSF Railway is generally obligated to either replace the asset or pay a fixed loss amount. The inclusion of the fixed loss amount is a standard clause within the lease arrangements. Historically, BNSF Railway has not incurred significant losses related to this clause. As such, it is not anticipated that the maximum exposure to loss would materially differ from the future minimum lease payments. 
    
  BNSF Railway does not provide financial support to the VIEs that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. 
    
  BNSF Railway maintains and operates the leased assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements, which set specific guidelines consistent within the industry. As such, BNSF Railway has no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets. BNSF Railway does not hold the power to direct the activities of the VIEs and therefore does not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the VIEs. Additionally, BNSF Railway does not have the obligation to absorb losses of the VIEs or the right to receive benefits of the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Depending on market conditions, the fixed-price purchase options could potentially provide benefit to the Company; however, any benefits potentially received from a fixed-price purchase option are generally expected to be minimal. Based on these factors, BNSF Railway is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. As BNSF Railway is not the primary beneficiary and the majority of the VIE leases are operating leases, the assets and liabilities related to the VIEs recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet are immaterial. 

7. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  Personal Injury 
    
  Personal injury claims, including asbestos claims and employee work-related injuries and third-party injuries (collectively, other personal injury), are a significant expense for the railroad industry. Personal injury claims by BNSF Railway employees are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers  Liability Act (FELA) rather than state workers  compensation laws. FELA s system of requiring the finding of fault, coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury system, contributed to increased expenses in past years. Other proceedings include claims by non-employees for punitive as well as compensatory damages. A few proceedings purport to be class actions. The variability present in settling these claims, including non-employee personal injury and matters in which punitive damages are alleged, could result in increased expenses in future years. BNSF Railway has implemented a number of safety programs designed to reduce the number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury expense. 
    
  BNSF Railway records an undiscounted liability for personal injury claims when the expected loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The liability and ultimate expense projections are estimated using standard actuarial methodologies. Liabilities recorded for unasserted personal injury claims are based on information currently available. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events such as the number of claims filed each year, developments in judicial and legislative standards and the average costs to settle projected claims, actual costs may differ from amounts recorded. BNSF Railway has obtained insurance coverage for certain claims, as discussed under the heading  BNSF Insurance Company.  Expense accruals and any required adjustments are classified as materials and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Asbestos 
    
  The Company is party to a number of personal injury claims by employees and non-employees who may have been exposed to asbestos. The heaviest exposure for certain BNSF Railway employees was due to work conducted in and around the use of steam locomotive engines that were phased out between the years of 1950 and 1967. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued after 1967 until they were substantially eliminated at BNSF Railway by 1985.

  BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY and SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

BNSF Railway assesses its unasserted asbestos liability exposure on an annual basis during the third quarter. BNSF Railway determines its asbestos liability by estimating its exposed population, the number of claims likely to be filed, the number of claims that will likely require payment and the estimated cost per claim. Estimated filing and dismissal rates and average cost per claim are determined utilizing recent claim data and trends. 
       
  During the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, the Company analyzed recent filing and payment trends to ensure the assumptions used by BNSF Railway to estimate its future asbestos liability were reasonable.  In the third quarter of 2016, management determined that the liability remained appropriate and no change was recorded.  In the third quarter of 2015, management recorded an increase in expense of $  5 million  .  The Company plans to update its study again in the third quarter of 2017. 
       
  Throughout the year, BNSF Railway monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims and expected claim payments and will record adjustments to the Company s estimates as necessary. 
    
  Based on BNSF Railway s estimate of the potentially exposed employees and related mortality assumptions, it is anticipated that unasserted asbestos claims will continue to be filed through the year 2050. The Company recorded an amount for the full estimated filing period through 2050 because it had a relatively finite exposed population (former and current employees hired prior to 1985), which it was able to identify and reasonably estimate and about which it had obtained reliable demographic data (including age, hire date and occupation) derived from industry or BNSF Railway specific data that was the basis for the study. BNSF Railway projects that approximately   65  ,   80   and   95   percent of the future unasserted asbestos claims will be filed within the next   10  ,   15   and   25   years, respectively. 
    
  Other Personal Injury 
    
  BNSF Railway estimates its other personal injury liability claims and expense quarterly based on the covered population, activity levels and trends in frequency and the costs of covered injuries. Estimates include unasserted claims except for certain repetitive stress and other occupational trauma claims that allegedly result from prolonged repeated events or exposure. Such claims are estimated on an as-reported basis because the Company cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible loss due to other non-work related contributing causes of such injuries and the fact that continued exposure is required for the potential injury to manifest itself as a claim. BNSF Railway has not experienced any significant adverse trends related to these types of claims in recent years. 
        
  BNSF Railway monitors quarterly actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received, the forecasted number of claims closing with payment and expected claim payments. Adjustments to the Company s estimates are recorded quarterly as necessary or more frequently as new events or revised estimates develop. 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity in the Company s accrued obligations for asbestos and other personal injury matters (in millions):

  BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY and SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , $  85 million   was included in current liabilities for both periods. Defense and processing costs, which are recorded on an as-reported basis, were not included in the recorded liability. The Company is primarily self-insured for personal injury claims. 
    
  Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle personal injury claims may range from approximately $  320 million   to $  430 million  . However, BNSF Railway believes that the $  362 million   recorded at   September 30, 2016   is the best estimate of the Company s future obligation for the settlement of personal injury claims. 
    
  The amounts recorded by BNSF Railway for personal injury liabilities were based upon currently known facts. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding personal injury litigation in the United States, could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected. 
    
  Although the final outcome of personal injury matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded, it is the opinion of BNSF Railway that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or liquidity. However, the occurrence of a number of these items in the same period could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year. 
    
  BNSF Insurance Company 
    
  Burlington Northern Santa Fe Insurance Company, Ltd. (BNSFIC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNSF, offers insurance coverage for certain risks, FELA claims, railroad protective and force account insurance claims and certain excess general liability and property coverage, and certain other claims which are subject to reinsurance. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , BNSFIC wrote insurance coverage with premiums totaling $  70 million   and $  73 million  , respectively, for BNSF Railway, net of reimbursements from third parties. During this same time, BNSF Railway recognized $  53 million   and $  57 million  , respectively, in expense related to those premiums, which is classified as purchased services in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , unamortized premiums remaining on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $  22 million   and   $5 million  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , BNSFIC made claim payments totaling $  74 million   and $  202 million  , respectively, for settlement of covered claims. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , claims receivables from BNSFIC were $  6 million   and $  15 million  , respectively. 
    
  Environmental 
    
  The Company s operations, as well as those of its competitors, are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation. BNSF Railway s operating procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Additionally, many of BNSF Railway s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF Railway is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, as well as similar state laws, generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF Railway has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party (PRP) for study and cleanup costs at Superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be determined (the Superfund sites) and, in many instances, is one of several PRPs. In addition, BNSF Railway may be considered a PRP under certain other laws. Accordingly, under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes, BNSF Railway may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site. If there are other PRPs, BNSF Railway generally participates in the cleanup of these sites through cost-sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site. Costs are typically allocated based on such factors as relative volumetric contribution of material, the amount of time the site was owned or operated and/or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each PRP. 
    
  BNSF Railway is involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory cleanup efforts for   217   sites, including   18   Superfund sites, at which it is participating in the study or cleanup, or both, of alleged environmental contamination.

Liabilities for environmental cleanup costs are recorded when BNSF Railway s liability for environmental cleanup is probable and reasonably estimable. Subsequent adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods. Environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies as well as costs for remediation of sites determined to be contaminated. 
       
  BNSF Railway estimates the ultimate cost of cleanup efforts at its known environmental sites on an annual basis during the third quarter. Ultimate cost estimates for environmental sites are based on current estimated percentage to closure ratios, possible remediation work plans and estimates of the costs and likelihood of each possible outcome, historical payment patterns, and benchmark patterns developed from data accumulated from industry and public sources, including the Environmental Protection Agency and other governmental agencies. These factors incorporate into the estimates experience gained from cleanup efforts at other similar sites.  
    
  Annual studies do not include: (i) contaminated sites of which the Company is not aware; (ii) additional amounts for third-party tort claims, which arise out of contaminants allegedly migrating from BNSF Railway property, due to a limited number of sites; or (iii) natural resource damage claims. BNSF Railway continues to estimate third-party tort claims on a site by site basis when the liability for such claims is probable and reasonably estimable. BNSF Railway s recorded liability for third-party tort claims as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $  12 million   for both periods. 
        
  On a quarterly basis, BNSF Railway monitors actual experience against the forecasted remediation and related payments made on existing sites and conducts ongoing environmental contingency analyses, which consider a combination of factors including independent consulting reports, site visits, legal reviews and analysis of the likelihood of other PRPs' participation in, and their ability to pay for, cleanup. Adjustments to the Company s estimates will continue to be recorded as necessary based on developments in subsequent periods. Additionally, environmental accruals, which are classified as materials and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants, third-party claims and legal fees incurred for defense of third-party claims and recovery efforts. 
           
  The following table summarizes the activity in the Company s accrued obligations for environmental matters (in millions): 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , $  45 million   and $  50 million   was included in current liabilities, respectively. 
    
  During the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, the Company analyzed recent data and trends to ensure the assumptions used by BNSF Railway to estimate its future environmental liability were reasonable.  As a result of this study, in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, management recorded an additional expense of $  8 million   and $  7 million   as of the respective June 30 measurement dates.  The Company plans to update its study again in the third quarter of 2017. 
       
  BNSF Railway s environmental liabilities are not discounted. BNSF Railway anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at   September 30, 2016  , will be paid over the next   ten   years, and no individual site is considered to be material.

Liabilities recorded for environmental costs represent BNSF Railway s best estimate of its probable future obligation for the remediation and settlement of these sites and include both asserted and unasserted claims. Although recorded liabilities include BNSF Railway s best estimate of all probable costs, without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties, BNSF Railway s total cleanup costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be required, evolving environmental laws and regulations, advances in environmental technology, the extent of other parties  participation in cleanup efforts, developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be contaminated and developments in environmental surveys and studies of contaminated sites. 
    
  Because of the uncertainty surrounding these factors, it is reasonably possible that future costs for environmental liabilities may range from approximately $  285 million   to $  490 million  . However, BNSF Railway believes that the $  350 million   recorded at   September 30, 2016  , is the best estimate of the Company s future obligation for environmental costs. 
    
  Although the final outcome of these environmental matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of BNSF Railway that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or liquidity. However, the occurrence of a number of these items in the same period could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year. 
    
  Other Claims and Litigation 
    
  In addition to asbestos, other personal injury and environmental matters discussed above, BNSF Railway and its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal actions and claims, governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be class actions. Although the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, BNSF Railway currently believes that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or liquidity. However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.

    Related Party Transactions 
       
  BNSF Railway is involved with BNSF and certain of its subsidiaries in related party transactions in the ordinary course of business, which include payments made on each other s behalf and performance of services. Under the terms of a tax allocation agreement with BNSF, BNSF Railway made federal and state income tax payments, net of refunds, of $  590 million   and $  779 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which are reflected in changes in working capital in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , BNSF Railway had $  252 million   and $  116 million  , respectively, of intercompany receivables which are reflected in accounts receivable in the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , BNSF Railway had $  27 million   and $  19 million   of intercompany payables, respectively, which are reflected in accounts payable in the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net intercompany balances are settled in the ordinary course of business.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , BNSF Railway had $  14,804 million   and $  12,597 million  , respectively, of intercompany notes receivable from BNSF. The $  2,207 million     increase   in intercompany notes receivable was due to loans to BNSF during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . All intercompany notes have a variable interest rate of   1.0   percent above the monthly average of the daily effective Federal Funds rate. Interest is collected semi-annually on all intercompany notes receivable. Interest income from intercompany notes receivable is presented in interest income, related parties in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
       
  Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income, a component of equity within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, rather than net income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Under existing accounting standards, other comprehensive income may include, among other things, unrecognized gains and losses and prior service credit related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

    Accounting Pronouncements 
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance in ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 applies to most contracts with customers. Insurance and leasing contracts are excluded from the scope. ASU 2014-09 prescribes a five-step framework in accounting for revenues from contracts within its scope, including (a) identification of the contract, (b) identification of the performance obligation under the contract, (c) determination of the transaction price, (d) allocation of the transaction price to the identified performance obligation and (e) recognition of revenue as the identified performance obligation is satisfied. ASU 2014-09 also prescribes additional disclosures and financial statement presentations. ASU 2014-09 was effective for public companies in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. In August of 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date one year to the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period). ASU 2014-09 may be adopted retrospectively or under a modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect is recognized at the date of initial application. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 (ASU 2015-17), Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position, and eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. BNSF early adopted the provisions of this ASU during the first quarter of 2016 and applied it prospectively.  ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial position, and had no impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.   
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02), Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08 (ASU 2016-08), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net).  ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09.  The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09 outlined above.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 (ASU 2016-10), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations   Licensing and Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12 (ASU 2016-12), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, respectively.  Both provide further clarification for the implementing the new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09.  The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 (ASU 2016-15), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The standard is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  ASU 2016-15 may be adopted retrospectively or prospectively if it is impractical to apply the amendments retrospectively.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Management s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations. 
       
  Management s narrative analysis relates to the results of operations of BNSF Railway Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively BNSF Railway, Registrant or Company). The following narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. 
    
  The following narrative analysis of results of operations includes a brief discussion of the factors that materially affected the Company's operating results in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and a comparative analysis to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  

Results of Operations 
    
  Revenues Summary 
    
  The following tables present BNSF Railway s revenue information by business group: 

Fuel Surcharges 
    
  Freight revenues include both revenue for transportation services and fuel surcharges. Where BNSF Railway s fuel surcharge program is applied, it is intended to recover its incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed a threshold fuel price. Fuel surcharges are calculated differently depending on the type of commodity transported. BNSF Railway has two standard fuel surcharge programs   Percent of Revenue and Mileage-Based. In addition, in certain commodities, fuel surcharge is calculated using a fuel price from a time period that can be up to 60 days earlier. In a period of volatile fuel prices or changing customer business mix, changes in fuel expense and fuel surcharge may differ significantly.  
    
  The following table presents fuel surcharge and fuel expense information (in millions):

    Total fuel expense includes locomotive and non-locomotive fuel.

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   vs. the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  Revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $14,109 million  , a   decrease   of $  2,045 million  , or   13   percent as compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decline in revenue is primarily due to a 6.6 percent decline in unit volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue driven primarily by lower fuel prices. The change in revenues is due to the following: 

Average revenue per car / unit decreased 6.5 percent primarily as a result of lower fuel surcharges and business mix changes.     

Consumer Products volumes were relatively flat.  The addition of a new automotive customer and increased domestic intermodal volume was offset by lower international intermodal volume due to soft economic activity and excess retail inventories.   

Industrial Products unit volumes decreased primarily due to lower petroleum products and commodities that support drilling due to pipeline displacement of U.S. crude traffic, along with lower U.S. production.  In addition, there was lower demand for steel and taconite, partially offset by increased movements of non-owned rail equipment and increased plastic product volumes. 

Agricultural Products unit volumes increased due to higher corn, soybeans, and wheat exports.   

Coal volumes decreased due to lower demand driven by reduced energy consumption, coal unit retirements and low natural gas prices.  
       
  Expenses 
    
  Operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were $  9,263 million  , a   decrease   of $  1,080 million  , or   10   percent, as compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . A significant portion of this decrease is due to the following changes in underlying trends in expenses:  

Compensation and benefits decreased due to lower headcount driven by lower volumes and productivity improvements, partially offset by inflation.  

Fuel expense decreased primarily due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes. 

Materials and other expense decreased primarily as a result of lower crew transportation, lodging and other travel costs, locomotive and freight car materials, and derailment-related costs. 

There were no significant changes in purchased services, depreciation and amortization expense, and equipment rents. 

Capital Commitments 
    
  BNSF Railway anticipates that capital commitments for 2016 will be approximately $4.05 billion or $100 million lower than previously disclosed.

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 
       
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, BNSF Railway s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that BNSF Railway s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by BNSF Railway in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to BNSF Railway s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Additionally, as of the end of the period covered by this report, BNSF Railway's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that there have been no changes in BNSF Railway's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during BNSF Railway s   third   fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, BNSF Railway's internal control over financial reporting.

  PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.      Legal Proceedings. 
    
  Beginning May 14, 2007, some 30 similar class action complaints were filed in six federal district courts around the country by rail shippers against BNSF Railway and other Class I railroads alleging that they have conspired to fix fuel surcharges with respect to unregulated freight transportation services in violation of the antitrust laws. The complaints seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages. These cases were consolidated and are currently pending in the federal District Court for the District of Columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. (  In re: Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge     Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1869  ). Consolidated amended class action complaints were filed against BNSF Railway and three other Class I railroads in April 2008.  On June 21, 2012, the District Court certified the class sought by the plaintiffs. BNSF Railway and the other three Class I railroads appealed the class certification decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals. On August 9, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's class certification decision and remanded the case to permit the District Court to reconsider its decision in light of the United States Supreme Court case of   Comcast Corp. v.
