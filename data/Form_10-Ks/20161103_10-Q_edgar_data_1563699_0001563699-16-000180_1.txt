COVISINT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited)  

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Presentation   - The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements ( Financial Statements ) include the accounts of Covisint Corporation, a Michigan corporation, and subsidiaries ( Covisint , the  Company ,  we ,  our , and  us ). 
    
  The Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), for interim financial information and with the instructions of Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, contingencies and results of operations.  While management has based its assumptions and estimates on the facts and circumstances existing at   September 30, 2016  , final amounts may differ from these estimates.  In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.   
    
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date these Financial Statements were issued.   
    
  These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   (   2016   Annual Report ).  There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies as disclosed in the Company s   2016   Annual Report. 
    
     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
            
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, requiring all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. ASU 2016-09 will also allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the provisions of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
       
   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, requiring a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  ASU 2016-02 requires entities to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the provisions of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires all deferred income taxes to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard prospectively as of March 31, 2016.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and a subsequent amendment to the standard in March 2016 with ASU 2016-08, a new comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The standard's core principle is that revenue should be recognized as goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date by one year.  In accordance with the delay, this ASU will now be effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of adopting this guidance.

2.    CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  The components of the Company s intangible assets are as follows (in thousands): 

_____________________________________________________ 
           (1)   
    The Covisint trademarks were acquired by Compuware in an acquisition in March 2004 and contributed to Covisint by Compuware effective January 1, 2013. These trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite life and therefore are not being amortized. 
              (2)   
    Amortization of capitalized software is included in  cost of revenue  in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Historically, capitalized software has been amortized over   five years  .  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, capitalized software is being amortized over   three   years. 
       
  Based on the current competitive environment and rapidly changing landscape for cloud based platform software, effective April 1, 2016, the Company changed its estimate of the useful life of capitalized software from five years to three years.  This change in useful life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and will be applied to all new capitalized software.  Remaining carrying amounts of capitalized software intangible assets will be amortized prospectively over a maximum of three years, or the remaining useful lives if less than three years.  The change in estimated useful life did not have an impact on the earnings per share disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Amortization expense of intangible assets was   $1.1 million   and   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2.0 million   and   $1.8 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Estimated future amortization expense, based on identified intangible assets at   September 30, 2016  , is expected to be as follows (in thousands):

3.    LOSS PER COMMON SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent shares outstanding using the treasury method.   
    
  EPS data were computed as follows (in thousands, except for per share data): 

Stock awards to purchase approximately   3,314,000   and   4,469,000   shares for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   3,307,000   and   4,554,000   shares for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because they were anti-dilutive.

4.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  The Company conducts its business in various leased facilities which, based on the lease terms, are considered to be operating leases.  There have been no material changes in our commitments under the lease agreements or other contractual obligations, as disclosed in our   2016   Annual Report. 
    
  Legal Matters 
    
  The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, investigations and proceedings in the ordinary course of business.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company makes a provision for a liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.   
    
  Beginning on May 30, 2014,   two   putative class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, our directors and former directors, and certain of our officers and former officers alleging violation of securities laws in connection with Covisint's initial public offering ( IPO ) and seeking unspecified damages.  These lawsuits were consolidated in the action entitled Desrocher v. Covisint Corporation, et al., No. 14-cv-03878 (the  Securities Class Action ).  On October 14, 2014, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint (the  Complaint ) alleging violations of Regulation S-K and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint alleges, among other things that the IPO s registration statement contained (1) untrue statements and omissions of material facts related to the Company s projected revenues for fiscal 2014, (2) materially inaccurate statements regarding the Company s revenue recognition policy, and (3) omissions of known trends, uncertainties and significant risk factors as required to be disclosed by Regulation S-K.   
    
  On May 5, 2016, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement to dismiss all claims with prejudice and settle the Securities Class Action (the  Settlement ).  The Settlement was reached after the Court denied defendants' motions to dismiss and granted class certification of a class of all persons who purchased the Company's stock in and/or traceable to the Company's IPO on or about September 26, 2013, seeking to pursue remedies under Section 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.  The Settlement, which is subject to Court approval, provides for a payment by the defendants of   $8.0 million  .  The Company's uninsured portion of the settlement amount is   $0.4 million  , which was recorded as a liability as of March 31, 2016 and paid in July 2016.    The hearing on Court approval of the Settlement is currently scheduled for December 13, 2016.

5.    BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  Covisint 401(k) Plan 
    
  Under the Covisint 401(k) plan, the Company matches   33 percent   of employees  401(k) contributions up to   2 percent   of eligible earnings.  Matching contributions vest   100 percent   when an employee reaches   one   year of service.  The Company expensed   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.2 million   and   $0.2 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to this program. 
    
  Covisint Stock-Based Compensation Plan 
    
  In August 2009, Covisint established a 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2009 Covisint LTIP ) allowing the Board of Directors of Covisint to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance-based cash or RSU awards and annual cash incentive awards to employees and directors of Covisint and its affiliates.  The 2009 Covisint LTIP reserves   7.5 million   common shares of Covisint for issuance under this plan. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   2.9   million stock options and   0.5 million   RSUs outstanding from the 2009 Covisint LTIP.   No options or RSUs issued contain performance conditions.   For the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   0.1 million   options and   0.3 million   options, respectively, were exercised by participants of the 2009 Covisint LTIP. 
    
  Stock Option Activity 
    
  A summary of option activity under the Company s stock-based compensation plans as of   September 30, 2016  , and changes during the   six   months then ended is presented below (shares and intrinsic value in thousands): 

All options were originally granted at estimated fair market value for those granted prior to our IPO, and at fair market value for those granted post IPO.  Options expire   ten   years from the date of grant unless expiration has been otherwise accelerated in accordance with a termination and/or separation agreement.

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net stock awards compensation expense was recorded as follows (in thousands):  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   total stock compensation expense is comprised of   $0.4 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, according to the normal expense recognition of the grant.  For the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   total stock compensation expense is comprised of   $0.9 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively, according to the normal expense recognition of the grant, and   $0.0 million   and    $0.4 million  , respectively, for accelerated expense recognized due to the cancellation of options for certain current employees. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation cost of   $2.8 million  , net of estimated forfeitures, related to   nonvested equity awards granted is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.9   years.  The following table summarizes the Company s estimated future recognition of its unrecognized compensation cost related to stock awards as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands).

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  In  this Quarterly Report, the terms  Covisint ,  the Company ,  we ,  us , or  our , mean Covisint Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report and with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   ("  2016   Annual Report").  In addition to historical information, the information we provide or statements made by our employees contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and Item 1A of this Quarterly Report under "Risk Factors".  Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies and operations, financing plans, potential growth opportunities, potential market opportunities and the effects of competition.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as  anticipates,   believes,   could,   seeks,   estimates,   expects,   intends,   may,   plans,   potential,   predicts,   projects,   should,   will,   would  or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms.  Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  Also, forward-looking statements represent our management s plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs only as of the date of this report.  Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. 

OVERVIEW  
  Covisint provides a cloud platform for the development of identity-centric and Internet of Things ( IoT ) solutions (collectively the  Platform ).  Our Platform gives our customers a substantial strategic advantage by enabling them to rapidly develop and deploy these applications faster and more cost-effectively than the alternatives, and in so doing, compete more effectively in their markets. Our Platform has been successfully operating globally on an enterprise scale for over 13 years, and it is the technology behind innovative industry solutions such as General Motors  OnStar, Hyundai s BlueLink  and Cisco Systems' Service Exchange Platform  ( SXP ). 
  Our Platform provides a complete set of integrated technologies that addresses a rapidly growing available market, particularly in the automotive and manufacturing industries, which span three horizontal use cases - the IoT, cloud identity and access management, and business-to-business collaboration.  To support our growth strategies and capitalize on current technology trends, we have made, and continue to make substantial investments to: a) expand our installed customer base; b) win new customers in the automotive industry; and c) land new customers via our channel partners via outbound OEM agreements with independent software vendors and system integrators. 
    
  We experienced net losses of   $4.9 million   and   $4.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $9.9 million   and   $10.7 million   in the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Since we are continuing to actively invest in our business to drive long-term growth, we do not expect to be profitable during fiscal 2017.

Table of Contents  

COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Revenue  
    
  Our revenue is primarily comprised of fees related to subscription and support as well as services performed.  Subscription and support revenue includes fees for our customers' and their users' access to our Platform.  Service revenue is generated from fees related to the implementation of our Platform and consulting services for our customers, as well as from other non-subscription sales.  Implementation services typically consist of user migration, content migration, solution deployment, configuration, and training to support customer-specific work flows.  Our services engagements typically occur in phases and can vary from a few weeks to several months depending on the scope and complexity of the solution.  Our customers may choose to do much of this work in-house, through a third party, or with Covisint.  We currently subcontract portions of our service engagements to third-party service partners to supplement our staffing needs within this area of the business. 
    
  Services contract value varies significantly for each customer agreement, and can be impacted by a number of trends which make the prediction of our future services revenue difficult.  These trends include, but are not necessarily limited to, improvements in our Platform that make it easier for our customers to build and launch new business process innovations on the Platform, the implementation of our certified partner program, and a reduction in the effort required to launch the customer.  
    
  Our revenue generally fluctuates, and we expect it to continue to fluctuate, between periods due to inconsistent timing of sales, revenue recognition requirements (e.g., acceptance), changes in customer requirements and other factors.  As a result, transactions that were expected to be recognized in one period may be recognized in a different period, which may materially affect our financial performance in a reporting period.  
    
  Cost of Revenue  
    
  Our cost of revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and personnel-related expenses related to our customer support, implementation, solution deployment, on-boarding and data center operations, the cost of professional services provided by third-party contractors, depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses related to capitalized research and development, acquisitions and capital expenditures, third-party hosting fees, third-party software license fees, and outside services related to our call center.  Where we have established third-party evidence or a best estimate of selling price of the stand-alone value of our services, we recognize expense with the associated revenue recognition as services are delivered.  Costs associated with deferred services revenue are recognized ratably, generally over five years, beginning upon customer acceptance of the deliverable consistent with the associated revenue.  
    
  We expect our cost of revenue may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue due to relative changes in our services revenue, changes in the percentage of services recognized using the proportional performance method, the amount and timing of depreciation and amortization, changes in the amount of services performed by our customers or other vendors and the mix of subscription and support revenue relative to services revenue. 
    
  Research and Development  
    
  Research and development costs are primarily comprised of salaries and personnel-related expenses, services provided by third-party contractors related to software development, software license and hardware fees and depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
    
  We focus our research and development on new and expanded features of our Platform, utilizing an agile delivery methodology for our Platform enhancements.  We capitalize a portion of these costs related to our hosted software and application services that have reached the application development stage.  Capitalization of such cost begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose.  Our capitalized software costs are amortized as a cost of revenue ratably over a period of three years upon completion of the project. 
    
  Sales and Marketing  
    
  Sales and marketing costs are primarily comprised of salaries and personnel-related expenses, commissions, travel expense, marketing program fees, services provided by third-party contractors related to our marketing campaigns and amortization related to customer relationship agreements acquired as a result of various acquisitions. 
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

General and Administrative  
       
  General and administrative costs are primarily comprised of personnel-related expenses associated with our tax, internal audit, accounting, finance, human resources, and legal functions, including salaries, benefits, as well as external legal, accounting, and other professional fees. 
    
  Income Taxes  
    
  Provision for income taxes is comprised of federal and state taxes in the United States as well as certain foreign tax jurisdictions.  Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  Deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  
    
  The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.  These deferred tax assets are subject to periodic assessments as to recoverability.  If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized, valuation allowances are recorded which would increase the provision for income taxes.  In making such determinations, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.   Given the Company's historical loss position in the U.S., it has been determined the Company does not expect to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, resulting in a full valuation allowance preventing the recognition of any potential deferred tax asset for its U.S. operations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
    
  There have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our   2016   Annual Report. 

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  Stock award compensation expense is recognized, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

KEY METRICS  
    
  In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor a number of other metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, allocate capital and make strategic decisions.  
    
  Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin  
    
  Adjusted gross profit represents gross profit, adjusted for amortization of capitalized software costs associated with our research and development activities which are currently classified within cost of revenue, as well as for stock based compensation associated with certain of our professional services and operations employees.  Adjusted gross margin represents adjusted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue.  
    
  We believe that adjusted gross margin, when viewed with our results under U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides additional information that is useful for evaluating our operating performance.  Additionally, we believe that adjusted gross margin provides a more meaningful comparison of our operating results against those of other companies in our industry. However, adjusted gross margin is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin as an indicator of operating performance.  
    
  The table below provides reconciliations between the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures discussed above to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures of gross profit (in thousands, except percentages):

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,   2016   AND   2015    
    
  Revenue 
    
  Revenue derived from our subscription and support and services is presented in the table below: 

Our total revenue decreased to   $17.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $18.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a   7%   decrease in total revenue. 
    
  Subscription and support revenue was   $14.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $15.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a decline of   4%  .  The decrease in subscription revenue was due to the shift out of our lower margin healthcare application business, as well as other customer attrition, partially offset by new business.  
    
  Our services revenue was   $2.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $3.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a decline of   18%  .   This reflected a relatively high volume of one-time projects related to new customer implementations in the prior period. 
    
  Our highest concentration of total revenue, including services, comes from the automotive industry which accounted for   55%   and   53%   of our total revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The healthcare industry accounted for   12%   and   16%   of our total revenue in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our remaining revenue resides in the energy, financial services, travel and other non-automotive and non-health care industries. 
    
  Our total revenue is also concentrated with two key customers, Cisco Systems ( Cisco ) and General Motors ( GM ).  As a result of the strategic partnership with Cisco, we enabled Cisco to serve as the prime contractor and Covisint as the subcontractor for agreements with various divisions of GM, which we historically provided directly to GM.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Cisco accounted for   43%   and   41%  , respectively, of our total revenue, of which   30%   and   28%  , respectively, is related to the transfer of the GM contracts and the augmentation of Cisco's SXP.  Our stand alone business with GM accounted for   3%   of our total revenue in each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Cost of Revenue 
    
  Cost of revenue is presented in the table below: 

Cost of revenue increased   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   largely attributable to increased technology costs and subcontractor usage related to increased investment in product support. 
    
  Our gross margin decreased to   48%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   54%   for the same period in   2015  .  The reduced margins were primarily due to the decline in revenue, as well as the increased technology and subcontractor expenses discussed above.

  Research and development costs incurred, expensed and capitalized are presented in the table below: 

Research and development costs incurred decreased to   $3.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $4.3 million   in the same period in   2015  .  The reductions were primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in labor expense as resources were deployed to customer support projects. 
    
  We capitalized   $0.7 million   and   $1.1 million   of internal software (research and development) costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decreased capitalization of our research and development costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to the lower level of incurred costs. 
    
  Sales and Marketing 
    
  Sales and marketing costs are presented in the table below: 

Sales and marketing costs slightly decreased by   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , largely due to a drop in stock compensation expense. 
    
  General and Administrative  
    
  General and administrative costs are presented in the table below: 

General and administrative costs decreased by   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , which was primarily a result of $0.4 million lower salary expense from continued rationalization of our general and administrative structure.

SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,   2016   AND   2015    
    
  Revenue 
    
  Revenue derived from our subscription and support and services is presented in the table below: 

Our total revenue decreased to   $34.6 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $36.9 million   in the six months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a   6%   decrease in total revenue. 
    
  Subscription and support revenue was   $29.2 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $30.9 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a decline of   6%  . The decrease in subscription revenue was due to the shift out of our lower margin healthcare application business, as well as other customer attrition, partially offset by new business.  
       
  Our services revenue was   $5.4 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $6.0 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a decline of   9%  .  This reflected a relatively high volume of one-time projects related to new customer implementations in the prior period. 
    
  Our highest concentration of total revenue, including services, comes from the automotive industry which accounted for   56%   and   52%   of our total revenue for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The healthcare industry accounted for   13%   and   18%   of our total revenue in the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our remaining revenue resides in the energy, financial services, travel and other non-automotive and non-health care industries. 
    
  Our total revenue is also concentrated with two key customers, Cisco and GM.  As a result of the strategic partnership with Cisco, we enabled Cisco to serve as the prime contractor and Covisint as the subcontractor for agreements with various divisions of GM, which we historically provided directly to GM.  For the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Cisco accounted for   42%   and   36%  , respectively, of our total revenue, of which   30%   and   25%  , respectively, is related to the transfer of the GM contracts and the augmentation of Cisco's SXP.  Our stand alone business with GM accounted for   3%   and   8%   of our total revenue in the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Cost of Revenue 
    
  Cost of revenue is presented in the table below: 

Cost of revenue decreased   $1.2 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in personnel and subcontractor expense due to the planned exit from the low margin services business, as well as due to reductions in technology expense from continued optimization of our hosting and telecommunications costs. 
    
  Our gross margin of   51%   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , was flat as compared with the same period in   2015  .

Research and Development 
    
  Research and development costs incurred, expensed and capitalized are presented in the table below: 

Research and development costs incurred decreased to   $8.2 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $8.3 million   in the same period in   2015  .  The reductions were primarily due to a decrease in labor and technology expense as resources were deployed to customer support projects.  These declines were partially offset by increased costs related to migrating customers to our enhanced platform offering. 
    
  We capitalized   $1.4 million   and   $1.5 million   of internal software (research and development) costs for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   The decreased capitalization of our research and development costs for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to the lower level of incurred costs. 
    
  Sales and Marketing 
    
  Sales and marketing costs are presented in the table below: 

Sales and marketing costs decreased   $0.4 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a restructuring of the direct sales and marketing organizations to align with our growth strategy of winning new customers in the automotive industry. 
    
  General and Administrative  
    
  General and administrative costs are presented in the table below: 

General and administrative costs decreased by   $1.4 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was attributable to a reduction in stock compensation expense of $0.6 million and a reduction in legal expense of $0.3 million, as well as our continued rationalization of our general and administrative structure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  In summary, our cash flows for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were: 

Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations. To date, we have incurred operating losses as reflected in our accumulated deficit, as well as negative cash flows as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  We do not expect to be profitable and expect negative cash flow for the full 2017 fiscal year as we continue to fund our current operations, implement our growth strategies, and fund capital expenditures.  We anticipate our current cash balance as well as cash to be received from current and existing customers will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and accommodate our growth for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  The consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report compute net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method.  Therefore, non-cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities (net of effects from acquisitions and currency fluctuations) are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities. 
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  
       
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $3.0 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.6 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to more favorable working capital fluctuations. 
    
  In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016, we received payment for the annual subscription for one of our agreements with Cisco for GM ( Cisco Agreements ), which is also reflected in cash from operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We receive the annual subscription fees in advance, at the commencement of each contract year, under this Cisco Agreement as well as for another Cisco Agreement (which was paid in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively). 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
    
  Cash used in investing activities typically consists of the purchase of property and equipment associated with our infrastructure and the expenditures on capitalized internal software (research and development) costs related to expanding our cloud-based Platform.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $1.6 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in cash used in investing activities is due to the prior year period which includes purchases of property and equipment and lease hold improvements associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Southfield, Michigan in May 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
    
   Net cash used in financing activities was   $0.2 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $0.1 million   provided by financing activities in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the exercises of stock awards.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUCEMENTS 
    
  New accounting guidance that we have recently adopted, as well as accounting guidance that has been recently issued, but not yet adopted by us, is included in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
   
  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
    
  Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties.  There have been no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our   2016   Annual Report. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We currently do not have any off-balance sheet or non-consolidated special purpose entity arrangements as defined by the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  We are exposed primarily to market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates.  We do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment, speculative or trading purposes.  We believe our foreign currency risk is minimal as   89%   and   91%   of our revenue was based in U.S. dollars for the six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Previously reported fiscal year 2016 U.S. dollar revenue percentages have been adjusted (from 85% to 91%) to be consistent with current fiscal year amounts.  In addition, we have no long-term assets or liabilities in foreign currencies.  We do not have a material exposure to market risk with respect to investments. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their objectives.  Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
    
  Beginning on May 30, 2014, two putative class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, our directors and former directors, and certain of our officers and former officers alleging violation of securities laws in connection with our IPO and seeking unspecified damages.  These lawsuits were consolidated in the action entitled Desrocher v. Covisint Corporation, et al., No. 14-cv-03878 (the  Securities Class Action ).  On October 14, 2014, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint (the  Complaint ) alleging violations of Regulation S-K and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint alleges, among other things that the IPO s registration statement contained (1) untrue statements and omissions of material facts related to the Company s projected revenues for fiscal 2014, (2) materially inaccurate statements regarding the Company s revenue recognition policy, and (3) omissions of known trends, uncertainties and significant risk factors as required to be disclosed by Regulation S-K.   
    
  On May 5, 2016, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement to dismiss all claims with prejudice and settle the Securities Class Action (the  Settlement ).  The Settlement was reached after the Court denied defendants' motions to dismiss and granted class certification of a class of all persons who purchased the Company's stock in and/or traceable to the Company's IPO on or about September 26, 2013, seeking to pursue remedies under Section 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.  The Settlement, which is subject to Court approval, provides for a payment by the defendants of $8.0 million.  The Company's uninsured portion of the settlement amount is $0.4 million, which was recorded as a liability as of March 31, 2016 and paid in July 2016.    The hearing on Court approval of the Settlement is currently scheduled for December 13, 2016. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risks under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A in our   2016   Annual Report, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in the Annual Report.  These risks are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENT 
  THIS AGREEMENT, executed on                    , 2016, is made by and between Covisint Corporation, a Michigan corporation (the  Company ), and                          (the  Employee ).  This Severance Agreement supersedes and replaces any prior Severance Agreement between the Company and Employee. 
  WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of its business to foster the continued employment of key personnel; and 
  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company ( Company Board ) recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control exists and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among employees, may result in the departure or distraction of key personnel to the detriment of the Company; and 
  WHEREAS, the Company Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of the Company s key personnel, including the Employee, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company; 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, the Company and the Employee hereby agree as follows: 
  1.  Defined Terms  .  The definitions of capitalized terms used in this Agreement are provided in the last Section hereof. 
    
  2.        Term of Agreement  .  The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2019. 
    
  3.        Severance Payments  . 
       
  3.1        Subject to Section 3.2 hereof, if the Employee s employment is terminated within one (1) year following a Change in Control either by the Company (or its successor as contemplated under Section 6.1 below) or by the Employee, other than (A) by the Company for Cause, (B) by reason of death or Disability, or (C) by the Employee without Good Reason, then the Company shall pay the Employee the amounts, and provide the Employee the benefits, described in this Section 3.1 ( Severance Payments ), in addition to any payments and benefits to which the Employee is entitled with respect to his employment with the Company: 
    
  (A)        In lieu of any further salary payments to the Employee for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to the Employee, the Company shall pay to the Employee a lump  
  
   1 

sum severance payment, in cash, equal to 1 times (1x) the sum of (i) the Employee s annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination, and (ii) the Employee s target annual bonus under any annual bonus or incentive plan maintained by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in which occurs the Date of Termination. 
    
  (B)        For a 12-month period that begins following the Date of Termination (the  COBRA Reimbursement Period ), the Company will reimburse Employee for Employee s payments of premiums for COBRA continuation coverage as elected by Employee (the  COBRA coverage ), provided that Employee timely elects such COBRA coverage through the Company s COBRA administrator and such COBRA coverage remains in effect during the COBRA Reimbursement Period.  Invoices for the COBRA coverage premiums will be mailed to Employee on a monthly basis.  Within 30 days of receiving verification that Employee has paid the COBRA premiums, the Company will reimburse Employee in the amount of such premiums paid by the Employee during the COBRA Reimbursement Period.     
    
  (C)        Notwithstanding any provision of any annual incentive plan to the contrary, the Company shall pay to the Employee an amount, in cash, equal to the sum of any unpaid incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded to the Employee for a completed fiscal year preceding the Date of Termination under any such plan and which, as of the Date of Termination, is contingent only upon the continued employment of the Employee to a subsequent date. 
    
  (D)        Unless otherwise vested under the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan or the applicable stock option agreement, upon the Date of Termination, Employee s unvested options will vest immediately and the Employee may exercise the options as if he were still employed. 
    
  3.2    (A)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Employee in connection with, or on account of, a Change in Control (including any payment or benefit received in connection with the termination of the Employee s employment on account of a Change in Control, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement) (all such payments and benefits, including the Severance Payments, being hereinafter referred to as the  Total Payments ) would be subject (in whole or part), to the Excise Tax, then, after taking into account any reduction in the Total Payments permitted under Section 280G of the Code to that portion of the Total Payments payable under such other plan, arrangement or agreement, to the extent the Total Payments still result in an excess payment under Section 280G of the Code, Total Payments shall be adjusted further as follows: 
  (i) the portion of the Total Payments that does not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall first be reduced, then  
  
   2 

(ii) to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, the portion of the Total Payments that constitutes deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall thereafter be reduced, but only if (A) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (B) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which the Employee would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). 
  (B)    For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Employee shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a  payment  within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code, if such waiver is otherwise permitted by law, shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel reasonably acceptable to the Employee ( Tax Counsel ), does not constitute a  parachute payment  within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. 
  (C)    At the time that payments are made under this Agreement, the Company shall provide the Employee with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax Counsel or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).  If the Employee objects to the Company s calculations, the Company shall pay to the Employee such portion of the Severance Payments (up to 100% thereof) as the Employee determines is necessary to result in the proper application of subsection A of this Section 3.2. 
  3.3    Subject to the provisions of Section 12 hereof, the payment provided in subsections (A) and (C) of Section 3.1 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth business day following the Date of Termination. 
    
  4.        Termination Procedures and Compensation During Dispute  . 

3 

4.1        Notice of Termination  .  After a Change in Control and during the Term, any purported termination of the Employee s employment (other than by reason of death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 7 hereof.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Notice of Termination  shall mean a notice which shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Employee s employment. 
  4.2        Date of Termination  .   Date of Termination,  with respect to any purported termination of the Employee s employment after a Change in Control and during the Term, shall mean (i) if the Employee s employment is terminated by the Company, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given, or such earlier date as is specified in the Notice of Termination and (ii) if the Employee s employment is terminated by the Employee, fifteen (15) days after Notice of Termination is given. 
    
  5.        No Mitigation  .  The Company agrees that, if the Employee s employment with the Company terminates during the Term, the Employee is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to the Employee by the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof.  Further, except as specifically provided in Section 3.1(B) hereof, no payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall be reduced by any compensation earned by the Employee as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Employee to the Company, or otherwise. 
    
  6.        Successors; Binding Agreement  . 
    
  6.1        In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to the Company, the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.   
    
  6.2        This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Employee s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If the Employee shall die while any amount would still be payable to the Employee hereunder (other than amounts which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of the Employee) if the Employee had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Employee s estate. 
    
  7.        Notices  .  For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by overnight courier service such as FedEx, addressed,

No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Employee and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Company Board.  No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of any lack of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.  This Agreement supersedes any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof which have been made by either party.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan.  All references to sections of the Exchange Act or the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to such sections.  Any payments provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding required under federal, state or local law and any additional withholding to which the Employee has agreed.  The obligations of the Company and the Employee under this Agreement which by their nature may require either partial or total performance after the expiration of the Term (including, without limitation, those under Sections 3 hereof) shall survive such expiration. 
    
  9.        Validity  .  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 
    
  10.        Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 
    
  11.        Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration  .   
    
  11.1        All claims by the Employee for benefits under this Agreement shall be in writing.  Any denial of a claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered to the Employee in writing and shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon.  The Company shall afford a reasonable opportunity to the Employee for a review of the decision denying a claim.   
  
   5 

11.2    Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the city and state of the Employee s principal residence as of the date of the Change in Control, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect;   provided  ,   however  , that the evidentiary standards set forth in this Agreement shall apply.  Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator s award in any court having jurisdiction. 
    
  12.        Section 409A  .  The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code to the extent subject thereto or be exempt therefrom, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the Employee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of this Agreement until such time as the Employee is considered to have incurred a  separation from service  from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separately identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and any payments that are due within the  short term deferral period  as defined in Section 409A of the Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise.  To the extent required to avoid the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the three-month period immediately following the Employee s termination of employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Employee s termination of employment (or upon the Employee s death, if earlier).  To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Employee under this Agreement shall be paid to Employee on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to Employee) during any one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.
