 PART I    FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated condensed financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere herein.  

 Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation is the successor to Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (MIC LLC) pursuant to the conversion (the Conversion) of MIC LLC from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation on May 21, 2015. MIC LLC was formed on April 13, 2004.  

 Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-Q to  MIC ,  we ,  us , and  our  refer (i) from and after the time of the Conversion, to Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation and its subsidiaries and (ii) prior to the Conversion, to our predecessor MIC LLC and its subsidiaries. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-Q to  common stock  or  shares  refer (i) from and after the time of the Conversion, to common stock and (ii) prior to the Conversion, LLC interests. Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc., which we refer to as
our Manager, is part of the Macquarie Group, comprising Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.  

 We own and operate a diversified group of businesses that provide services to other businesses, government agencies and individuals primarily in the U.S. The businesses we own and operate include: 

International-Matex Tank Terminals, or IMTT  :  a bulk liquid terminals business providing bulk liquid storage, handling and other services to third parties at ten marine terminals in the United States and two in Canada; 

Atlantic Aviation  :  a provider of fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring and other services primarily to owners and operators of general aviation (GA) aircraft at 69 airports in the United States; 

Contracted Power and Energy segment, or CP E  :  ownership of a gas-fired power facility and controlling interests in wind and solar power facilities in the United States; and 

MIC Hawaii  :  ownership of an energy company that processes and distributes gas and provides related services (Hawaii Gas), controlling interests in renewable and distributed power facilities and ownership of a design-build mechanical contractor focused on energy efficiency, all based in Hawaii.  

Our businesses generally operate in sectors with barriers to entry including high initial development and construction costs, long-term contracts or the requirement to obtain government approvals and a lack of immediate cost-effective alternatives to the services provided. Overall they tend to generate sustainable, stable and growing cash flows over the long term.  

 Overview  

 In addition to our results under U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures to assess the performance and prospects of our businesses. In particular, we use Free Cash Flow, EBITDA excluding non-cash items and certain proportionately combined financial metrics. Proportionately combined financial metrics reflect MIC Corporate and our ownership interest in each of our businesses.  

 In analyzing the financial performance of our businesses, we focus primarily on cash generation and Free Cash Flow in particular. We believe investors use Free Cash Flow as a measure of our ability to sustain and potentially increase our quarterly cash dividend and to fund a portion of our growth.  

 We measure EBITDA excluding non-cash items as it reflects our businesses  ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses.

 See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Results of Operations   Consolidated   Free Cash Flow, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) excluding non-cash items and Proportionately Combined Metrics   for further information on our calculation of Free Cash Flow, EBITDA excluding non-cash items and our proportionately combined metrics in Part I of this Form 10-Q.  

 At IMTT, we focus on providing bulk liquid storage, handling and other services for customers who place a premium on ease of access and operational flexibility. The substantial majority of IMTT s revenue is generated pursuant to  take-or-pay  contracts providing access to storage tank capacity and ancillary services.  

 At Atlantic Aviation, our focus is on attracting and maintaining relationships with GA aircraft owners and pilots and encouraging them to purchase fuel and other services from our fixed base operations (FBOs). Atlantic Aviation s gross profit is correlated with the number of GA flight movements in the U.S. and the business  ability to service a portion of the aircraft involved in those operations.  

 The businesses that comprise our CP E segment generate revenue by producing and selling electric power pursuant primarily to long-dated power purchase agreements (PPAs) and tolling agreements with creditworthy off-takers.  

 MIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in reducing the cost and improving the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. The businesses of MIC Hawaii generate revenue primarily from the provision of gas services to commercial, residential and governmental customers, the generation of power and the design and construction of building mechanical systems.  

 Dividends  

 Since January 1, 2015, MIC has paid or declared the following dividends:  

We currently intend to maintain, and where possible, increase our quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. The MIC Board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, or a 3.2% increase over the dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and 14.2% increase over the dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. In determining whether to adjust the amount of our quarterly dividend, our Board will take into account such matters as the state of the capital markets and general business conditions, the Company s financial condition, results of operations,
capital requirements, capital opportunities and any contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders or by its subsidiaries to the Company, and any other factors that it deems relevant, subject to maintaining a prudent level of reserves and without creating undue volatility in the amount of such dividends where possible. Moreover, the Company s senior secured credit facility and the debt commitments at our businesses contain restrictions that may limit the Company s ability to pay dividends. Although historically we have declared cash dividends on our shares, any or all of these or other factors could result in the modification of our dividend policy, or the reduction, modification or elimination of our dividend in the future.  

 Over the long term, we believe we will distribute between 75% and 85% of the Free Cash Flow generated by our businesses as a cash dividend. We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities, which includes cash paid for interest, taxes and pension contributions, less maintenance capital expenditures, which includes principal repayments on capital lease obligations used to fund maintenance capital expenditures, and excludes changes in working capital. For the avoidance of doubt, base management fees and performance fees, if any, are excluded from the calculation of Free Cash Flow whether paid in cash or stock.

 Results of Operations  

 Consolidated  

 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results for the Quarter: 

an improvement in gross profit; and 

an increase in other income, net, from our IMTT and CP E businesses; partially offset by 

an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.  

Our consolidated results of operations are as follows:  

NM   Not meaningful  

(1) 

           Interest expense includes gains on derivative instruments of $3.7 million and losses on derivative instruments of $43.0 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, interest expense includes losses on derivative instruments of $29.5 million and $38.4 million, respectively.

 Results of Operations:   Consolidated      (continued)   

 Gross Profit  

 Consolidated gross profit increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflecting improved results at Atlantic Aviation and CP E, principally our renewables business, and contribution from acquisitions within MIC Hawaii. In addition, consolidated gross profit increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the contribution from the acquisition of Bayonne Energy Center (BEC) and unrealized gains on commodity hedges at Hawaii Gas.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to costs associated with acquired FBOs, higher salaries and benefit costs and higher rent expense at Atlantic Aviation, transactional and incremental costs from new acquisitions at MIC Hawaii and professional fees associated with the implementation of a shared services center.  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to absence of transaction costs related to the BEC acquisition, costs associated with the Conversion and a decrease in costs at CP E, primarily our renewables business. The decrease is partially offset by incremental expenses associated with BEC for the first quarter of 2016 and the increases reflected in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

 Fees to Manager  

 Our Manager is entitled to a monthly base management fee based primarily on our market capitalization, and potentially a quarterly performance fee, based on our total shareholder return relative to a U.S. utilities index. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred base management fees of $18.4 million and $49.6 million, respectively, and no performance fees. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred base management fees of $18.1 million and $53.6 million, respectively, and performance fees of $284.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In accordance with
the Third Amended and Restated Management Service Agreement, our Manager has currently elected to reinvest base management fees, and performance fees, if any, in additional shares.    

 The unpaid portion of the base management fees and performance fees, if any, at the end of each reporting period is included in  Due to Manager-related party  in our consolidated condensed balance sheets. The following table shows our Manager s reinvestment of its base management fees and performance fees, if any, in shares, except as noted:

Depreciation  

 Depreciation expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the write-off of damaged tanks and docks at IMTT and the depreciation associated with FBOs acquired by Atlantic Aviation. The increase in depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also includes the depreciation associated with the BEC acquisition, partially offset by the absence of non-cash impairments at Atlantic Aviation.  

 Amortization of Intangibles  

 Amortization of intangibles decreased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to certain intangibles being fully amortized at Atlantic Aviation. The decrease in amortization of intangibles for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also reflects the absence of non-cash impairments at Atlantic Aviation recorded during the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by the incremental amortization of intangibles associated with BEC.  

 Interest Expense and Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments  

 Interest expense includes gains on derivative instruments of $3.7 million and losses on derivative instruments of $43.0 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with losses on derivative instruments of $29.5 million and $38.4 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Gains and losses on derivatives recorded in interest expense are attributable to the change in fair value of interest rate hedging instruments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense also included the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs at MIC
Hawaii related to the refinancing of its $80.0 million term loan and its $60.0 million revolving credit facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, interest expense also included the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs at IMTT related to the May 2015 refinancing.  

 Excluding the derivative adjustments and deferred financing cost write-offs, interest expense decreased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the overall lower weighted average interest rate, partially offset by higher average debt balance. See discussions on interest expense for each of our operating businesses below.  

 As part of the refinancing of IMTT s debt in May 2015, IMTT paid $31.4 million in interest rate swap breakage fees related to the termination of out-of-the-money interest rate swap contracts related to prior debt facilities. In July 2015, the Company fully repaid the outstanding debt balance at BEC and paid $19.2 million in interest rate swap breakage fees. See further discussion in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Liquidity and Capital Resources  .  

 Other Income, net  

 Other income, net, increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to insurance recoveries on damaged docks at IMTT and escrow proceeds received during the current quarter related to our acquisition of BEC.  

 Income Taxes  

 We file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes the financial results for IMTT, Atlantic Aviation, BEC, MIC Hawaii and our allocable share of the taxable income (loss) from our solar and wind power facilities, which are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. Pursuant to a tax sharing agreement, the businesses included in our consolidated federal income tax return, pay MIC an amount equal to the federal income tax each would have paid on a standalone basis as if they were not part of the MIC consolidated federal income tax return.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Results of Operations:   Consolidated      (continued)   

 The change from income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the absence of any tax benefit in 2016 associated with the performance fees incurred during the first half of 2015. The change in tax rate from a benefit of 34.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a tax expense of 41.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to the impact of the performance fee on taxable income for 2015.  

 For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect any consolidated federal income tax liability to be fully offset by our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). We believe that we will be able to use all of our federal prior year NOLs prior to their expiration. Our federal NOL balance at December 31, 2015 was $426.2 million. As a result of having federal NOLs, together with planned tax strategies, we do not expect to make regular federal tax payments any earlier than the second half of 2019. For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to report taxable income of approximately $51.0 million and pay approximately $37,000
in Alternative Minimum Tax.  

 For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to pay state income taxes of approximately $6.4 million. In calculating our consolidated state income tax provision, we have provided a valuation allowance for certain state income tax NOLs, the use of which is uncertain.  

 Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act)  

 The PATH Act retroactively extends several tax provisions applicable to corporations, including the extension of 50% bonus depreciation for certain assets placed in service in 2015, 2016 and 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for eligible property placed in service in 2018 and 30% bonus depreciation for eligible property placed in service in 2019. Other than the extension of the bonus depreciation provision, the Company does not expect the provisions of the PATH Act to have a material effect on its tax profile.  

 Free Cash Flow, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) excluding non-cash items and Proportionately Combined Metrics  

 In addition to our results under U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures to assess the performance and prospects of our businesses. In particular, we use Free Cash Flow, EBITDA excluding non-cash items and certain proportionately combined financial metrics. Proportionately combined financial metrics reflect MIC Corporate and our ownership interest in each of our businesses.  

 In analyzing the financial performance of our businesses, we focus primarily on cash generation and Free Cash Flow in particular. We believe investors use Free Cash Flow as a measure of our ability to sustain and potentially increase our quarterly cash dividend and to fund a portion of our growth.  

 We measure EBITDA excluding non-cash items as it reflects our businesses  ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses.  

 Given our varied ownership levels in some of our businesses, principally in the CP E segment, together with our obligations to report the results of these businesses on a consolidated basis, management believes that GAAP measures such as net income (loss) do not fully reflect all of the items it considers in assessing the amount of cash generated based on its ownership interest in its businesses. We note that the proportionately combined metrics used may be calculated in a different manner by other companies and may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure. Therefore, proportionately combined metrics should be used
as a supplemental measure to help understand our financial performance and not in lieu of our financial results reported under GAAP.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Results of Operations:   Consolidated      (continued)   

 We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities    the most comparable GAAP measure    , which includes cash paid for interest, taxes and pension contributions, less maintenance capital expenditures, which includes principal repayments on capital lease obligations used to fund maintenance capital expenditures, and excludes changes in working capital. We define EBITDA excluding non-cash items as net income (loss) or earnings    the most comparable GAAP measure    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash items including
impairments, unrealized derivative gains and losses and adjustments for other non-cash items reflected in the statements of operations. EBITDA excluding non-cash items also excludes base management fees and performance fees, if any, whether paid in cash or stock. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have disclosed Free Cash Flow on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments and MIC Corporate. We believe that both Free Cash Flow and EBITDA excluding non-cash items support a more complete understanding of the business factors and economic trends reflected in the financial performance of our businesses than would otherwise be achieved using GAAP results alone.  

 Free Cash Flow reflects the ability of our businesses to generate cash on an ongoing basis, in part in support of our dividend and to fund a portion of our growth. Our businesses can be characterized as owners of high-value, long-lived assets which are capable of generating Free Cash Flow in excess of GAAP net income as a result of: (i) non-cash depreciation, amortization and any impairment charges; (ii) our ability to defer all or a portion of current federal income taxes; (iii) non-cash unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments; and, (iv) various other non-cash items such as pension expense, amortization of
tolling liabilities and gains (losses) on disposal of assets. The non-cash pension expense primarily consists of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial and performance gains and losses. Any cash contributions to pension plans are reflected as a reduction to Free Cash Flow, as noted above. In addition, management uses Free Cash Flow as a measure of our ability to sustain and potentially increase our quarterly cash dividend and to fund a portion of our growth. We believe that external consumers of our financial statements, including investors and research analysts, use this metric to assess our performance and as an indicator of our success in generating a cash return on investment.  

 Free Cash Flow does not take into consideration required payments on indebtedness and other fixed obligations or the other cash items that are excluded from our definition of Free Cash Flow. We note that Free Cash Flow may be calculated differently by other companies thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Free Cash Flow should be used as a supplemental measure to help understand our financial performance and not in lieu of our financial results reported under GAAP.  

 Classification of Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Growth Capital Expenditures  

 We categorize capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures or growth capital expenditures. As neither maintenance capital expenditure nor growth capital expenditure is a GAAP term, we have adopted a framework to categorize specific capital expenditures. In broad terms, maintenance capital expenditures primarily maintain our businesses at current levels of operations, capability, profitability or cash flow, while growth capital expenditures primarily provide new or enhanced levels of operations, capability, profitability or cash flow. We consider a number of factors in determining whether a specific capital
expenditure will be classified as maintenance or growth.  

 In some cases, specific capital expenditures contain characteristics of both maintenance and growth capital expenditures. We do not bifurcate specific capital expenditures into growth and maintenance components. Each discrete capital expenditure is considered within the above framework and the entire capital expenditure is classified as either maintenance or growth.

 Results of Operations:   IMTT      (continued)   

 Revenue  

 IMTT generates the majority of its revenue from contracts typically comprising a fixed monthly charge (that escalates annually with inflation) for access to or use of its infrastructure. We refer to revenue generated from such contracts or fixed charges as firm commitments. Firm commitments are generally of medium term duration and at the end of the third quarter in 2016, had a revenue weighted average remaining life of approximately two and half years. Revenue from firm commitments comprised 81.5% of total revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

 For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenue decreased by $2.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases reflect primarily a reduced level of spill response activity on the part of IMTT s subsidiary, OMI Environmental Solutions (OMI), and a decrease in rail services revenue principally in connection with the reduced demand for Canadian crude oil in the U.S. The decline in rail service revenues was more than offset by an increase in other revenue from firm commitments, primarily due to an increase in utilization,
such that revenue from total firm commitments increased slightly in both the quarter and nine months period. However, the increase in revenue from total firm commitments was more than offset by a decline in ancillary (non-firm commitment) revenue.  

 Consistent with strong demand patterns across petroleum product storage markets, capacity utilization was higher than historically normal levels at 96.7% and 96.4% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with 94.7% and 94.8% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The business expects utilization rates to revert to historical levels of 94% to 96% in the medium term.  

 Costs (Cost of Services and General and Administrative Expenses)  

 Costs were 5.3% and 10.9% lower in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The reduction in costs was primarily the result of lower costs associated with OMI as a result of a lower level of spill related activity, lower fuel costs, improved cost controls and the continued realization of efficiencies following our acquisition of the second half of IMTT in 2014.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the write-off of tanks and docks.  

 Interest Expense, net  

 Interest expense includes gains on derivative instruments of $1.4 million and losses on derivative instruments of $14.0 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with losses on derivative instruments of $9.8 million and $11.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Excluding the derivative adjustments, interest expense decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt balance. Excluding the derivative adjustments,
interest expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a higher average debt balance partially offset by lower interest rates. The weighted average interest rate on all outstanding debt facilities, including interest rate swaps, was 3.39% at September 30, 2016.  

 Cash interest paid totaled $3.9 million and $23.4 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with $4.2 million and $18.0 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

 Results of Operations:   IMTT      (continued)   

 As part of the refinancing of its debt in May 2015, IMTT paid $31.4 million in interest rate swap breakage fees related to the termination of out-of-the-money interest rate swap contracts related to prior debt facilities. See further discussion in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Liquidity and Capital Resources  .  

 Other Income, net  

 IMTT maintains insurance against the loss of use or damage to IMTT s facilities. The business incurred insured losses in connection with damage done to various docks in Bayonne and Gretna for which recoveries of approximately $13.0 million and $15.5 million were recorded during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  

 Income Taxes  

 The federal taxable income generated by IMTT is reported as part of our consolidated federal tax return. The business files state income tax returns in the states in which it operates. For the year ending December 31, 2016, the business expects to pay state income taxes of approximately $3.0 million. The  Provision for income taxes, net of changes in deferred taxes  of $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the above table includes $2.2 million of state income taxes and $881,000 of federal income tax. Any current federal income tax payable is expected to be offset in consolidation with the
application of NOLs at the MIC holding company level.  

 The significant difference between IMTT s book and federal taxable income relates to depreciation of terminal fixed assets. For book purposes, these fixed assets are depreciated primarily over 15 to 30 years using the straight-line method of depreciation. For federal income tax purposes, these fixed assets are depreciated primarily over 5 to 15 years using accelerated methods. Most terminal fixed assets placed in service between 2012 through 2015 qualified for the federal 50% bonus tax depreciation. A significant portion of Louisiana terminal fixed assets constructed after Hurricane Katrina were financed with Gulf
Opportunity Zone Bonds (GO Zone Bonds). GO Zone Bond financed assets are depreciated, for tax purposes, primarily over 9 to 20 years using the straight-line depreciation method. Most of the states in which the business operates do not allow the use of 50% bonus tax depreciation. However, Louisiana allows the use of 50% bonus depreciation except for assets financed with GO Zone Bonds.  

 Maintenance Capital Expenditures  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, IMTT incurred maintenance capital expenditures of $33.1 million and $34.5 million on an accrual basis and cash basis, respectively, compared with $20.6 million and $16.9 million on an accrual basis and cash basis, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in maintenance capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of $13.9 million of expenditures associated with the rebuilding of damaged docks at IMTT s Gretna and Bayonne terminals. IMTT anticipates deploying approximately $40.0 million in maintenance
capital expenditures for the full year 2016 inclusive of the $13.9 million associated with the dock rebuilding that was reimbursed. The property insurance recoveries are recorded in  Other Income, net  in the above statement of operations.  

 Other Matters  

 A portion of the labor force at IMTT s Bayonne, NJ facility is unionized. The collective bargaining agreement under which the unionized employees have been working was originally scheduled to expire on June 20, 2016. Negotiation of a new agreement is underway and the current contract has been extended through November 30, 2016 to facilitate additional discussions between IMTT management and the union representatives. The business has commenced implementation of contingency plans in the event of work stoppage/job action.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Results of Operations:   Atlantic Aviation      (continued)   

 Revenue and Gross Profit  

 The majority of the revenue and gross profit earned by Atlantic Aviation is generated through fueling GA aircraft at facilities located at 69 U.S. airports at which Atlantic Aviation operates. The business pursues a strategy of maintaining and, where appropriate, increasing dollar-based margins on fuel sales. Generally, fluctuations in the cost of fuel are passed through to the customer.  

 Revenues increased $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 due to an increase in the volume of fuel sold, rental revenue and ancillary service revenues, partially offset by a significant decline in the wholesale cost of fuel. The increase in gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to the increase in revenue and the decline in the wholesale cost of fuel.  

 Revenues decreased $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of a significant decline in the wholesale cost of fuel, partially offset by an increase in the volume of fuel sold, rental revenue and ancillary service revenues. The decline in the wholesale cost of fuel more than offset the reduction in revenues resulting in an increase in gross profit.  

 Our discussion of same store results in the current and prior comparable periods reflects contributions from FBOs that have been in operation for the same full months in each period, and excludes the costs of acquiring, integrating or disposing of FBOs. On a same store basis, gross profit increased 5.7% and 4.9% in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 driven by an increase in fuel gross profit, ancillary services and hangar rentals.  

 Atlantic Aviation seeks to extend FBO leases prior to their maturity to improve our visibility into the cash generating capacity of these assets. Atlantic Aviation calculates the weighted average lease life based on EBITDA excluding non-cash items in the prior calendar year adjusted for the impact of acquisitions/dispositions. At September 30, 2016, the weighted average lease life increased to 19.5 years compared with 19.0 years at September 30, 2015, notwithstanding the passage of one year, as a result of successful extension and acquisition of leaseholds.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to costs associated with acquired FBOs, higher salaries and benefit costs and higher rent expense. On a same store basis, costs were 3.6% and 2.7% higher in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to certain intangibles being fully amortized, partially offset by depreciation associated with FBOs acquired. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of the absence of non-cash impairments. The non-cash impairments incurred during the first quarter of 2015 were attributable to the reassessment of the useful lives of contractual arrangements and leasehold
and land improvements related to leases at certain airports and a change in the lease terms at one base.

 Interest Expense, Net  

 Interest expense includes gains on derivative instruments of $257,000 and losses on derivative instruments of $10.7 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with losses on derivative instruments of $7.5 million and $14.3 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Excluding the derivative adjustments, interest expense decreased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to lower average debt balances. The weighted average interest rate on all outstanding debt
facilities, including interest rate swaps, was 4.63% at September 30, 2016. Cash interest paid was $6.7 million and $20.4 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with $7.7 million and $22.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

 Income Taxes  

 The federal taxable income generated by Atlantic Aviation is reported as part of our consolidated federal income tax return. The business files state income tax returns in the states in which it operates. The tax expense in the table above includes both state taxes and the portion of the consolidated federal tax liability attributable to the business.  

 For the year ending December 31, 2016, the business expects to pay state income taxes of approximately $1.7 million. The  Provision for income taxes, net of changes in deferred taxes  of $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the above table includes $1.5 million of state income taxes and $1.0 million of federal income tax. Any current federal income tax payable is expected to be offset in consolidation with the application of NOLs at the MIC holding company level.  

 Maintenance Capital Expenditures  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Atlantic Aviation incurred maintenance capital expenditures of $5.8 million and $5.9 million on an accrual basis and cash basis, respectively, compared with $13.0 million and $11.5 million on an accrual basis and cash basis, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Maintenance capital expenditures for the periods presented were primarily to fund replacement of equipment at existing locations.

 Revenue and Gross Profit  

 Total revenue and gross profit increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of improved solar and wind output. In addition, total revenue and gross profit increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the acquisition of BEC on April 1, 2015. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, solar resources were at long-term historical average. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, wind resources were approximately 96% and 92%,
respectively, of long-term historical average. 

 At BEC, revenue and gross profit decreased marginally in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Lower capacity prices in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were largely offset by higher utilization in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Higher utilization was driven by higher than expected summer temperatures, which resulted in an average capacity factor of approximately 46% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with approximately 41% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We expect capacity prices covering
November 2016 through April 2017, which impacts only the 37.5% untolled portion of BEC s revenue, to be lower than in the prior comparable period. The remaining 62.5% of BEC s revenue is generated pursuant to a tolling agreement with a creditworthy off-taker.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to absence of transaction costs related to the BEC acquisition, partially offset by incremental costs incurred from BEC related to the first quarter of 2016.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to incremental depreciation and amortization associated with BEC for the first quarter of 2016.  

 Other Income (Expense), net  

 Other income (expense), net, increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to escrow proceeds received during the current quarter related to our acquisition of BEC.  

 Interest Expense, Net  

 Interest expense includes gains on derivative instruments of $1.9 million and losses on derivative instruments of $17.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with losses on derivative instruments of $12.2 million and $12.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Excluding the derivative adjustments, interest expense increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to higher average debt balance partially offset by lower interest rates. Excluding the derivative
adjustments, interest expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to lower interest rates, principally on the BEC debt facilities, and lower average debt balances on all facilities. 

 The weighted average interest rate on all outstanding debt facilities, including interest rate swaps, was 4.32% at September 30, 2016. Cash interest paid totaled $6.1 million and $18.5 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with $5.9 million and $20.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

 In connection with the BEC acquisition in April 2015, the business assumed $509.1 million of debt facilities, of which $257.6 million was repaid on June 12, 2015 and the remaining balance of $251.5 million was repaid on July 20, 2015. As part of the repayment, BEC paid $19.2 million in interest rate swap breakage fees associated with the termination of out-of-the-money interest rate swap contracts. On August 10, 2015, BEC entered into new debt agreements. See further discussion in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Liquidity and Capital
Resources  .  

 Income Taxes  

 Our solar and wind power facilities are held in LLCs that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. As such, these entities do not pay federal or state income taxes on a standalone basis, but each partner pays federal and state income taxes based on their allocated share of taxable income. For the year ending December 31, 2016, MIC expects its allocated share of the federal taxable income from these facilities to be a loss of approximately $23.0 million. For 2015, MIC s allocated share of the taxable income from the solar and wind power facilities was a loss of approximately $36.0 million.  

 On April 1, 2015, we acquired 100% of BEC. The federal taxable income generated by BEC is reported as part of our consolidated federal income tax return and is subject to New York state income tax on a stand-alone basis. For the year ending December 31, 2016, the business does not expect to have a state income tax liability. We do not believe that the business will generate a current federal income tax liability for the year ending December 31, 2016. Future current federal taxable income attributable to BEC may be offset in consolidation with the application of NOLs at the MIC holding company level.  

 Other Matters  

 CP E relies on a small number of suppliers to provide long term operations and maintenance (O M) and other services for its facilities. One of those O M providers, SunEdison, Inc. (SunEdison), filed for bankruptcy in April 2016. SunEdison has continued to perform its obligations as an O M provider, and we expect it to continue to do so. CP E has implemented contingency plans to mitigate any potential operational issues that might arise as a result of the inability of SunEdison to provide agreed upon services.  

 Results of Operations:   MIC Hawaii    

 MIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in reducing the cost and improving the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. The businesses of MIC Hawaii generate revenue primarily from the provision of gas services to commercial, residential and governmental customers, the generation of power and the design and construction of building mechanical systems.  

 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results for the Quarter: 

an increase in gross profit primarily due to: 

contribution from acquisitions; and 

an increase in the volume of gas sold; partially offset by 

a decrease in margin per therm; and 

an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.

 Revenue and Gross Profit  

 The increase in revenue and gross profit includes contribution from acquisitions during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The volume of gas sold by Hawaii Gas increased by 6.7% and 3.2%, respectively, in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015. On an underlying basis, adjusting for changes in customer inventory, the volume of gas sold increased by 6.6% and 3.6% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  

 Gross profit, excluding the impact of unrealized gains on commodity hedges, increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to acquisitions and an increase in the volume of gas sold, partially offset by lower margin per therm.  

 The business currently sources feedstock for its synthetic natural gas (SNG) plant from Hawaii Independent Energy and on September 30, 2016 filed an application with the Hawaii Public Utility Commission requesting approval of a new feedstock supply contract through December 31, 2020.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general administrative expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to transactional and operating costs from new acquisitions, partially offset by lower sales and promotion, vehicle, legal and salaries and benefits costs.  

 Interest Expense, Net  

 Interest expense includes gains on derivative instruments of $152,000 and losses on derivative instruments of $691,000 for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with losses on derivative instruments of $98,000 and $417,000 for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Excluding the derivative adjustments and the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to the February 2016 refinancing, interest expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to the refinancing of
Hawaii Gas s $80.0 million term loan and $60.0 million revolving credit facility at rates that are lower by 0.50% and 0.25%, respectively. The decrease is partially offset by debt assumed from the acquisitions during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

 The weighted average interest rate on the primarily debt facilities, including interest rate swaps, was 3.55% at September 30, 2016. Cash interest paid totaled $2.8 million and $5.9 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with $2.7 million and $6.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

 Income Taxes  

 The federal taxable income generated by the MIC Hawaii businesses is reported as part of our consolidated federal income tax return and is subject to Hawaii state income tax on a stand-alone basis. The tax expense in the table above includes both state tax and the portion of the consolidated federal tax liability attributable to the businesses. For the year ending December 31, 2016, the business expects to pay state income tax of approximately $1.7 million. The  Provision for income taxes, net of changes in deferred taxes  of $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the above table, includes $5.1
million of federal income tax and $1.4 million of state income tax. Any current federal income tax payable is expected to be offset in consolidation with the application of NOLs at the MIC holding company level.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, MIC Hawaii incurred maintenance capital expenditures of $5.3 million and $6.0 million on an accrual basis and cash basis, respectively, compared with $4.6 million and $8.0 million on an accrual basis and cash basis, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Maintenance capital expenditures for the periods presented were primarily for transmission line modifications (net of customer reimbursements) and vehicle replacements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 General  

 Our primary cash requirements include normal operating expenses, debt service, debt principal payments, payments of dividends and capital expenditures. Our primary source of cash is operating activities, although we may draw on credit facilities for capital expenditures, access the capital markets or sell assets to generate cash.  

 At September 30, 2016, our consolidated debt outstanding totaled $2,912.4 million, our consolidated cash balances totaled $28.4 million and total available capacity under our revolving credit facilities totaled $1,065.0 million.

 On October 7, 2016, Atlantic Aviation completed the refinancing of its existing $595.9 million term loan and $70.0 million revolving credit facility. Atlantic Aviation entered into a new five-year first lien senior secured $400.0 million term loan facility and a new five year first lien senior secured $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the New AA Credit Agreement). The $400.0 million term loan facility and the $350.0 million revolver credit facility bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.50% and 2.25%. The term loan includes amortization of 2.5% of the initial principal balance for
the first year, 5% per annum for the next two years and subsequently, 7.5% per annum until maturity.  

 Proceeds from the new Atlantic Aviation term loan facility, together with $200.0 million drawn on the revolving credit facility, were used primarily to fully repay the outstanding balance on the existing term loan facility. Subsequently, $175.0 million of the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was repaid and the balance at October 31, 2016 was $25.0 million, with $325.0 million of undrawn capacity. Concurrent with entering into these new facilities, the business paid $17.8 million of interest rate swap breakage fees associated with the termination of out-of-the-money interest rate swap contracts related to
the prior debt facilities. On October 21, 2016, the business entered into $400.0 million of interest rate caps with a strike price of 1.0% to hedge the one month LIBOR floating rate interest exposure on the new Atlantic Aviation term loan facility. The business paid $8.6 million in upfront premiums to enter into the caps.  

 On October 13, 2016, MIC completed an underwritten public offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2023. On October 28, 2016, the underwriters exercised in full, their option to issue an additional $52.5 million in convertible senior notes. The net proceeds of $392.4 million were used partially to repay a portion of the drawn balance under the revolving credit facility under the New AA Credit Agreement, the full repayment of the outstanding balance on both the MIC senior secured and IMTT revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.  

 The refinancing of the Atlantic Aviation debt and the issuance of the convertible notes at MIC is expected to result in savings of approximately $11.0 million in cash interest expense per annum.

We will, in general, apply available cash to the repayment of revolving debt balances as a means of minimizing interest expense and draw on those facilities to fund growth projects and for general corporate purposes.  

 We use revolving credit facilities at each of our operating companies and the holding company as a means of maintaining access to sufficient liquidity to meet future requirements, managing interest expense and funding growth projects. We base our assessment of the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources on the assumptions that: 

our businesses overall generate, and are expected to continue to generate, significant operating cash flow; 

the ongoing capital expenditures associated with our businesses are readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or available debt facilities; and 

we will be able to refinance, extend and/or repay the principal amount of maturing long-term debt on terms that can be supported by our businesses.  

We capitalize our businesses in part using floating rate bank debt with medium-term maturities between five and seven years. In general, we hedge a portion of the floating rate exposure for the majority of the term of these facilities using interest rate derivative instruments.  

 We also use longer dated private placement debt and other forms of capital, including bank, bond or hybrid debt instruments to capitalize our businesses. In general, the debt facilities at our businesses are non-recourse to the holding company and there are no cross-collateralization or cross-guarantee provisions in these facilities.  

 Our solar and wind facilities are primarily financed with fully amortizing non-recourse project finance style debt with maturities prior to or coterminous with the expiration of the underlying PPAs. On a multiple of EBITDA basis, we use a higher initial level of leverage in these projects than our other business segments because of the long-term wholly contracted nature of the revenue stream and the creditworthiness of the PPA counterparties.

 Analysis of Consolidated Historical Cash Flows  

 The following section discusses our sources and uses of cash on a consolidated basis. All intercompany activities such as corporate allocations, capital contributions to our businesses and distributions from our businesses have been excluded from the tables as these transactions are eliminated on consolidation.  

NM   Not meaningful  

 Operating Activities  

 Consolidated cash provided by (used in) operating activities is generally comprised of EBITDA excluding non-cash items (as defined by us), less cash interest, taxes, pension contributions and changes in working capital. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Results of Operations   for discussions around the components of EBITDA excluding non-cash items on a consolidated basis and for each of our businesses.  

 The increase in consolidated cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to: 

improved EBITDA excluding non-cash items; 

an absence of performance fee settled in cash; and 

an absence of interest rate swap breakage fees paid at IMTT and BEC; partially offset by 

an increase in current state taxes.  

Investing Activities  

 The drivers of consolidated cash provided by investing activities include proceeds from divestitures of businesses and fixed assets. The drivers of consolidated cash used in investing activities include acquisitions of businesses in new and existing segments and capital expenditures. Acquisitions of businesses are generally funded by raising additional equity and/or drawings on credit facilities.  

 Maintenance capital expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures are generally funded by drawing on our available credit facilities or with equity capital. We may fund maintenance capital expenditures from credit facilities or equity capital and growth capital expenditures from operating activities from time to time. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Results of Operations   for maintenance capital expenditures for each of our businesses.  

 The decrease in consolidated cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of BEC in 2015 and proceeds from insurance recoveries received in 2016, partially offset by increased capital expenditures at all of our businesses during 2016.  

 Growth Capital Expenditures  

 We invested $152.3 million and $62.5 million of growth capital expenditures in our existing businesses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources   (continued)  

 We continuously evaluate opportunities to deploy capital in both growth projects and in acquisitions of additional businesses, whether as part of our existing businesses or in new lines of business. These opportunities may be significant, such as our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in IMTT, or they may be ordinary course bolt-on acquisitions, such as an acquisition of an FBO. In aggregate, we currently anticipate deploying approximately $300.0 million in these types of activities in 2016.  

 In addition, we maintain a backlog of projects that we expect to complete in subsequent periods. We consider projects to be a part of our backlog when we have committed to the deployment of capital for the underlying project, and have, where relevant, received all requisite approvals/authorizations for the deployment of such capital. The inclusion of a project in our backlog does not guarantee that the project will commence, be completed or ultimately generate revenue.  

 We are actively pursuing an expansion of BEC and have entered into certain agreements, including for the acquisition of generating sets, related to that project. As of this date, we have secured the approval of our board of directors as well as all of the regulatory approvals necessary to commence construction and have issued a  notice to proceed  to the general contractor. The construction of the additional 130 megawatt (MW) of power generating capacity on land adjacent to BEC is expected to require the deployment of approximately $130.0 million in growth capital, the majority of which is likely to be deployed in
2017. We are also in the process of connecting the BEC facility to a second gas pipeline that runs beneath our IMTT-Bayonne property, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2017. As of September 30, 2016, our backlog included approximately $340.0 million in a variety of growth projects (including BEC).  

 Financing Activities  

 The drivers of consolidated cash provided by financing activities primarily include new equity issuance and debt issuance related to acquisitions and capital expenditures. The drivers of consolidated cash used in financing activities primarily include repayment of debt principal balances on maturing debt and dividends to our shareholders.  

 The change in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to: 

an absence of cash proceeds from the equity offering completed in March 2015, net of offering costs paid; 

net borrowing on IMTT credit facilities upon refinancing its debt in May 2015, net of deferred financing costs paid; 

an increase in dividends paid to shareholders during 2016; and 

the purchase of the remaining 33.3% interest in IMTT s Quebec marine terminal that it did not previously own in March 2016; partially offset by 

the net repayment of term loan at BEC during 2015, net of deferred financing costs paid; and 

borrowings on the IMTT revolving credit facility for growth capital expenditures and the MIC revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes during 2016.  

IMTT  

 On May 21, 2015, IMTT refinanced its existing debt, in part, with new senior notes, new revolving credit facilities and redeemed and reissued its portfolio of tax-exempt bonds. In conjunction with the refinancing, Standard and Poor s and Fitch assigned IMTT an investment grade rating of BBB- with a stable outlook to the notes and the issuer. Concurrent with entering into these new facilities, the business paid $31.4 million in interest rate swap breakage fees associated with the termination of out-of-the-money interest rate swap contracts related to the prior debt facilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 For critical accounting policies and estimates, see  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and see Note 2,  Basis of Presentation , in our Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q for recently issued accounting standards. Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed materially from the description contained in our Annual Report.  

 Business Combinations  

 Our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by our management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information. Such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations. The
valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. The determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process.  

 Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment  

 Significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of businesses include contract rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks, property and equipment and goodwill. Trademarks are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles. Trademarks and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances. It may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks. However, for unamortized intangible assets, we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   (continued)  

 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) : Testing Goodwill for Impairment, permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test, as discussed below. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it need not perform the two-step impairment test.  

 If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it needs to perform the two-step impairment test. This requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is
performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an  implied fair value  of goodwill. The determination of a reporting unit s  implied fair value  of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the  implied fair value  of goodwill, which is compared with its corresponding carrying value. IMTT, Atlantic Aviation, CP E and MIC Hawaii are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis. The impairment test for trademarks, which are not amortized, requires the determination of the fair value of such assets. If the fair value of the trademarks is less than their carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and/or intangible assets. Such events
include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or material negative changes in relationships with significant customers.  

 Property and equipment is initially stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans. Our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in service assuming normal routine maintenance. We review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result
in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue. Factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage, examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand.  

 Significant intangibles, including contract rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and technology, are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans. With respect to contractual rights at Atlantic Aviation, the useful lives will generally match the remaining lease terms plus extensions under the business  control.  

 We perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization, when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. In this circumstance, the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value.  

 The  implied fair value  of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. We use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so.  

 We test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1 st  or when there is an indicator of impairment.

2. Basis of Presentation  

 The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by
GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  

 The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements but does not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Certain reclassifications were made to the financial statements for the prior period to conform to current period presentation.

 2. Basis of Presentation    (continued) 

 The interim financial information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future interim periods.  

 Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure related thereto at the date of the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.  

 Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.  

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

 On February 25, 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance (similar to current capital leases) or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU 2016-02 will require all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The guidance in the ASU is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is allowed. The standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures.  

 On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740):   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which modifies the disclosure requirements of deferred tax assets and liabilities on an entity s statement of financial position. Under this ASU, an entity will classify deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowances, as single noncurrent amounts provided that each tax-paying component of the entity is consistent. The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016
for public issuers. Early adoption is allowed. The Company has early adopted this ASU retrospectively and reclassified the deferred income taxes of $23.4 million from current assets to noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015. Adoption of this standard did not impact the Company s financial results of operations or cash flows in the current or previous interim and annual reporting periods.  

 On September 25, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805):   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments , which requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU also requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment
to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The standard must be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this

 ASU. The Company has adopted this ASU and determined that it did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, financial results of operations or cash flows.  

 On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  which defers the adoption date of ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  by one calendar year. ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. With the deferral, the new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. Early application
is permitted to the original effective date of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures.  

 On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation . The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method. The guidance in the ASU is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is allowed. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a significant impact to its consolidated condensed financial statements.  

 On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments. The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
The standard must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company has adopted this ASU retrospectively and reclassified the unamortized deferred financing costs from noncurrent assets to noncurrent liabilities as a reduction to long-term debt, net of current portion, on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. See Note 6,  Long-Term Debt , for the adoption of this standard. Adoption of this standard did not impact the Company s financial results of operations or cash flows in the current or previous interim and annual reporting periods.  

 On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a variable interest entity (VIE), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The ASU significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited
partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed through a contractual arrangement. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this ASU and determined that it did not impact the Company s financial condition, financial results of operations or cash flows.

 Following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted income (loss) per share ($ in thousands, except share and per share data):  

The effect of potentially dilutive shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 is calculated assuming that (i) the restricted stock unit grants totaling 10,755 provided to the independent directors on May 18, 2016, which will vest during the second quarter of 2017, had been fully converted to shares on the grant date; (ii) the $67.8 million of the performance fee for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, which was reinvested in shares by the Manager on August 1, 2016, had been reinvested in shares by the Manager in July 2015; and (iii) the convertible senior notes that were issued on July 15, 2014 had been fully converted into
share on that date. 

 The effect of potentially dilutive shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is calculated assuming that (i) the restricted stock unit grants totaling 10,755 provided to the independent directors on May 18, 2016, which will vest during the second quarter of 2017, and the 8,660 restricted stock units provided to the independent directors on June 18, 2015, which vested during the second quarter of 2016, had been fully converted to shares on those grant dates and (ii) the $67.8 million of the performance fee for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, which was reinvested in shares by the Manager on August 1, 2016, had been
reinvested in shares by the Manager in July 2015. The convertible senior notes that were issued on July 15, 2014 were anti-dilutive for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

 The effect of potentially dilutive shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 is calculated assuming that (i) the 8,660 restricted stock unit grants provided to the independent directors on June 18, 2015, which vested during the second quarter of 2016, had been fully converted to shares on the grant date and (ii) the $67.8 million of the performance fee for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, which was reinvested in shares by the Manager on August 1, 2016, had been reinvested in shares by the Manager in July 2015.

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s consolidated long-term debt comprised of the following ($ in thousands):  

(1) 

           See discussions below for transactions that occurred in October 2016 for these segments.  

The total undrawn capacity on the revolving credit facilities at IMTT, Atlantic Aviation, CP E, MIC Hawaii and MIC Corporate was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion at September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2016, respectively.  

 MIC Corporate  

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company drew down $196.0 million and repaid $132.0 million on its senior secured revolving credit facility primarily for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance was $80.0 million and the undrawn portion was $330.0 million. In October 2016, the Company repaid the outstanding balance in full.  

 On July 15, 2016, the Company adjusted the conversion rate related to its five-year, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% convertible senior notes. The conversion rate increased to 12.0091 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount. The adjustment reflects the impact of dividends paid by the Company from July 15, 2015, the last anniversary date of the convertible senior notes.  

 On October 13, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2023. On October 28, 2016, the underwriters exercised in full, their option to issue an additional $52.5 million in convertible senior notes. The net proceeds of $392.4 million were partially used to repay a portion of the drawn balance under the revolving credit facility under the New AA Credit Agreement (see below), the full repayment of the outstanding balances on both the MIC senior secured and IMTT revolving credit facilities and the remaining proceeds used for
general corporate purposes. The notes are convertible, at the holder s option, only upon satisfaction of one or more conditions set forth in the indenture governing the notes. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Company common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s election. The initial conversion rate is 8.9364 shares per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $111.90 per share, subject to adjustment). Upon a conversion in connection with the occurrence of certain events that constitute a  make-whole fundamental change,  the conversion rate will be increased by a specified amount with respect to notes tendered for conversion during a specified period after the effective date of the transaction. In addition, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) at a cash repurchase
price equal to 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes are not redeemable prior to maturity on October 1, 2023.

 The notes are the Company s unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.  

 Atlantic Aviation  

 At September 30, 2016, Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc. (AA FBO) had a $595.9 million term loan outstanding and a $70.0 million revolving credit facility that was undrawn. The business also had $1.7 million outstanding under a stand-alone debt facility used to fund construction at a certain fixed based operation.  

 On October 7, 2016, AA FBO completed the refinancing of its existing $595.9 million term loan and $70.0 million revolving credit facility. AA FBO entered into a new five-year first lien senior secured $400.0 million term loan facility and a new five year first lien senior secured $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the New AA Credit Agreement). The New AA Credit Agreement is guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by Atlantic Aviation FBO Holdings LLC (Holdings) and certain subsidiaries of AA FBO. Proceeds from the new term loan facility, together with $200.0 million drawn on the revolving credit
facility, were used primarily to fully repay the outstanding balance on the existing term loan facility. Subsequently, $175.0 million of the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was repaid and the balance at October 31, 2016 was $25.0 million, with $325.0 million of undrawn capacity.

 7. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  

 Interest Rate Contracts  

 The Company and certain of its businesses have in place variable-rate debt. Management believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of the businesses  interest payments. To meet this objective, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on a portion of its debt with a variable-rate component. These swaps change the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the Company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate
payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed-rate debt for the portion of the debt that is swapped.  

 At September 30, 2016, the Company had $2.9 billion of current and long-term debt, of which $1.6 billion was economically hedged with interest rate contracts, $1.2 billion was fixed rate debt and $100.0 million was unhedged. The Company does not use hedge accounting. All movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded directly through earnings.  

 As discussed in Note 6,  Long-Term Debt , Atlantic Aviation entered into five-year senior secured $400.0 million term loan facility. The interest rate on the term loan facility floats at LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.50% and 2.25%. On October 21, 2016, the business entered into $400.0 million of interest rate caps with a strike price of 1.0% to hedge the one month LIBOR floating rate interest exposure on the new Atlantic Aviation term loan facility. The business paid $8.6 million in upfront premiums to enter into the caps. As part of the refinancing, Atlantic Aviation paid $17.8 million in interest rate
swap breakage fees associated with the termination of out-of-the-money interest rate swap contracts related to the prior term loan facility.  

 As discussed in Note 6,  Long-Term Debt , the solar power facilities in MIC Hawaii entered into a ten year, $18.0 million amortizing term loan facility in July 2016. The interest rate on this term loan facility floats at LIBOR plus 2.0%. Concurrently, it entered into an amortizing interest rate swap contract with an original notional of $18.0 million. The contract is scheduled to amortize concurrently with the term loan and fixes the interest rate at 3.38% as at September 30, 2016.  

 In February 2016, in conjunction with the refinancing, as discussed in Note 6,  Long-Term Debt , Hawaii Gas entered into a new interest rate swap contract for an $80.0 million notional that took effect on August 8, 2016, upon the maturity of the existing interest rate swap, and expires on February 8, 2020. This new interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on the $80.0 million term loan at 2.74% as of September 30, 2016.  

 Commodity Price Hedges  

 The risk associated with fluctuations in the prices Hawaii Gas, a business within the MIC Hawaii reportable segment, pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities. Hawaii Gas s gross profit is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and Hawaii Gas may not always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis, particularly when product costs rise rapidly. In order to reduce the volatility of the business  propane market price risk, Hawaii Gas had used and expects to continue to use
over-the-counter commodity derivative instruments including price swaps. Hawaii Gas does not use commodity derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments used by Hawaii Gas to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract.  

 Financial Statement Location Disclosure for Derivative Instruments  

 The Company measures derivative instruments at fair value using the income approach which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value. These valuations use primarily observable (level 2) inputs, including contractual terms, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.

9. Reportable Segments  

 At September 30, 2016, the Company s businesses consist of four reportable segments: IMTT, Atlantic Aviation, CP E and MIC Hawaii.  

 IMTT  

 IMTT provides bulk liquid storage, handling and other services in North America through ten terminals located in the United States, one terminal in Quebec, Canada and one partially owned terminal in Newfoundland, Canada.

 9. Reportable Segments    (continued) 

 CP E  

 The CP E business segment derives revenue from solar, wind and gas-fired power facilities. Revenues from the solar, wind and gas-fired power facilities are included in product revenue. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has controlling interests in five utility-scale solar photovoltaic power facilities, two wind power facilities and 100% ownership of a gas-fired power facility that are located in the United States.  

 The solar and wind power facilities that are operational at September 30, 2016 have an aggregate generating capacity of 260 megawatt (MW) of wholesale electricity to utilities. These facilities sell substantially all of the electricity generated, subject to agreed upon pricing formulas, to electric utilities pursuant to long-term (typically 20   25 years) power purchase agreements (PPAs). These projects are held in LLCs, and are treated as partnerships for income tax purposes, with co-investors. The acquisition price on these projects can vary depending on, among other things, factors such as the size of the
project, PPA terms, eligibility for tax incentives, debt package, operating cost structure and development stage. A completed project takes out all of the construction risk, testing and costs associated with construction contracts.  

 The Company has certain rights to make decisions over the management and operations of these solar and wind power facilities. The Company has determined that it is appropriate to consolidate these projects, with the co-investors  interest reflected as  noncontrolling interests  in the consolidated condensed financial statements.  

 On April 1, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of BEC. As a result of this transaction, the financial results of BEC have been consolidated as part of CP E segment since the acquisition date. BEC is a 512 MW gas-fired power facility located in Bayonne, New Jersey, adjacent to IMTT s Bayonne facility. BEC has tolling agreements with a creditworthy off-taker for 62.5% of its power generating capacity and power produced is delivered to New York City via a dedicated transmission cable under New York Harbor. The tolling agreements generate revenue whether or not the facility is in use for power production. In addition to
revenue related to the tolling agreement and capacity payments from the grid operator, BEC generates an energy margin when the facility is dispatched.  

 MIC Hawaii  

 Effective with this quarterly report 10Q, the Company is combining its businesses and projects in Hawaii into a single segment, consistent with how the Company is managing those operations. Prior to this report, MIC Hawaii consisted solely of Hawaii Gas. MIC Hawaii now comprises: Hawaii Gas, Hawaii s only government-franchised gas utility and an unregulated liquefied petroleum gas distribution business providing gas and related services to commercial, residential and governmental customers; a mechanical contractor focused on designing and constructing energy efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and
related building infrastructure; and controlling interests in renewable and distributed power facilities including two facilities on Oahu. Revenue from Hawaii Gas and the renewable power facilities are recorded in product revenue. Revenue from the mechanical contractor business is recorded in service revenue.  

 Revenue from Hawaii Gas is generated from the distribution and sales of synthetic natural gas (SNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Revenue is primarily a function of the volume of SNG, LPG and LNG consumed by customers and the price per thermal unit or gallon charged to customers. Because both SNG and LPG are derived from petroleum, revenue levels, without organic growth, will generally track global oil prices.  

 All of the MIC business segments are managed separately and management has chosen to organize the Company around the distinct products and services offered. Selected information by segment is presented in the following tables.

In accordance with FASB ASC 280  Segment Reporting , the Company has disclosed earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) excluding non-cash items as a key performance indicator for the businesses. EBITDA excluding non-cash items is reflective of the businesses  ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of its businesses. The Company defines EBITDA excluding non-cash items as net income (loss) or
earnings    the most comparable GAAP measure    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash items including impairments, unrealized derivative gains and losses and adjustments for other non-cash items reflected in the statements of operations.

 PART II    OTHER INFORMATION  

   Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

 There have been no changes to legal proceedings set forth under Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016.  

   Item 1A. Risk Factors  

 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016, except for the following:  

 Changes in rules or policies by the governmental agencies that regulate the wholesale power markets could adversely affect operating results at our CP E businesses. 

 The wholesale power markets are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, independent system operators, such as the New York Independent System Operator, and regional transmission operators. Changes in generation capacity requirements or other components of wholesale market design or other changes in regulation by these governmental agencies could adversely impact demand for the services provided by our CP E businesses, and could adversely affect the prices our CP E businesses are able to receive for such services. Significant changes in demand or price could adversely affect the results of
operations at our CP E businesses. 

 The price of our stock and our ability to pay dividends could be adversely affected by our obligation to pay performance fees to our Manager, which in turn is dependent on the performance of our stock relative to a benchmark index which is unpredictable and beyond our control.  

 Under our Management Services Agreement, we are obligated to pay performance fees to our Manager if we outperform a benchmark index that reflects broader utility industry components. The amount of the performance fees can be substantial, and could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends. For example, if our absolute performance (as described in the Management Services Agreement) increases slightly and the benchmark index substantially decreases, we could be obligated to pay a significant performance fee. As a result, we may be obligated to pay our Manager a performance fee, which could
be substantial, even when there has not been a substantial increase in the performance of our common stock. The benchmark index comprises numerous utility stocks, the performance of which may or may not correlate to our actual performance. Moreover, the benchmark index is unpredictable and variable. The Manager is entitled to select whether a performance fee will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, which could result in a material cash expense or dilution of our shares.  

 Our Manager is not required to offer all acquisition opportunities to us and may offer such opportunities to other entities. Our management may waive investment opportunities presented by our Manager.  

 Pursuant to our Management Services Agreement, we have first priority ahead of all current and future funds, investment vehicles, separate accounts and other entities managed by our Manager or by members of the Macquarie Group within the Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets division only with respect to four specific types of acquisition opportunities within the United States. Other than these four specific types of opportunities, our Manager does not have an obligation to offer to us any particular acquisition opportunities, even if they meet our investment objectives, and the Manager and its affiliates can offer any or
all other acquisition opportunities on a priority basis or otherwise to current and future funds, investment vehicles and accounts sponsored by the Manager or its affiliates. Our businesses may compete with these entities for investment opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail with respect to such investments.  

 In addition, our management may determine not to pursue investment opportunities presented to us by our Manager, including those presented on a priority basis. If our management waives any such opportunity, our Manager and its affiliates may offer such opportunity to any other entity, including any entities sponsored or advised by members of the Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets division of the Macquarie Group. As such, every acquisition opportunity presented to us by our Manager may not be pursued by us, and may ultimately be presented to entities with whom we compete for investments.

to Determine Interest Rate . If prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan:

affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest
Period, or 

(b)          the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that by
reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest
Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining
their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof (including by telecopy)
to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (i) any Eurodollar Loans under
the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (ii) any Loans
under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall
be continued as ABR Loans and (iii) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last
day of the then-current Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative
Agent (which action the Administrative Agent will take promptly after the conditions giving rise to such notice no longer exist),
no further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right
to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans. 

2.18          Pro
Rata Treatment and Payments . (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on
account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders shall be made  pro   rata 
according to the respective Term Percentages or Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the relevant Lenders. Subject to
 Sections 2.25(e)(iv) ,  2.29(b)(2)  and  2.30(a)  and other than with respect to the incurrence of any Refinancing
Notes, each payment (including prepayments) in respect of principal, interest or fees in respect of Term Loans shall be applied
among tranches of Term Loans as directed by the Borrower. Subject to  Section 10.6(c) , each payment (including prepayments)
in respect of principal or interest in respect of any tranche of the Term Loans and each payment in respect of fees payable hereunder
shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Term Lenders with respect to such tranche,  pro   rata 
according to the respective amounts then due and owing to such Term Lenders. 

(b)          Each
payment (including prepayments) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on any tranche of Revolving Loans shall
be made  pro   rata  according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the
Revolving Lenders with respect to such tranches. Each payment in respect of Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter
of Credit shall be made to the Issuing Lender that issued such Letter of Credit. 

(c)           Payments .
The Borrower shall make each payment under any Loan Document not later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the day when due
to the Administrative Agent by wire transfer to the following account (or at such other account or by such other means to such
other address as Administrative Agent shall have notified the Borrower in writing within a reasonable time prior to such payment)
in immediately available Dollars and without setoff or counterclaim: 

In the case of the Administrative
Agent: 

(d)           Payment
Dates . If any payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business
Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable
on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result
of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 

(e)           Advancing
Payments . (i) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such
Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to
the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent
on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period
until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this  clause (e)(i)  shall be presumptively correct in the
absence of manifest error. If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by
such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall give notice of such fact to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate  per   annum 
applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
rights of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower against any Defaulting Lender. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such
interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing
to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such borrowing. 

(ii)          Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by
the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the relevant Lenders their respective  pro   rata  shares of a corresponding amount. If
such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each relevant Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant
to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate  per   annum  equal to the daily average Federal Funds
Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 

(f)           Application
of Voluntary Prepayments . Unless otherwise provided in this  Section 2.18  or elsewhere in any Loan Document, all payments
and any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent from or for the benefit of the Borrower shall be applied to repay the
Obligations as the Borrower designates (or, in the absence of such designation, in the direct order of maturity thereof). Amounts
repaid or prepaid pursuant to this clause (f) or clause (g) below on account of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed. 

(g)           Application
of Mandatory Prepayments . Subject to the provisions of clause (h) below with respect to the application of payments during
the continuance of an Event of Default and Section 2.30 with respect to the application of payments from the proceeds of Refinancing
Debt, any payment made by the Borrower to an Agent pursuant to  Section 2.12  or any other prepayment of the Obligations required
to be applied in accordance with this clause (g) shall be applied:  first , to the remaining scheduled amortization payments
in direct order of maturity and the payment at final maturity of the Term Loans until paid in full,  second , to repay the
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans (without reducing the Revolving Commitments),  third , to Cash Collateralize
the L/C Obligations to the extent the Available Revolving Commitment would be less than zero, and  then , excess (if any)
shall be retained by the Borrower. 

(h)           Application
of Payments During an Event of Default . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, following the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, and, other than in the case of an Event of Default under Section 8.1(f), notice thereof
to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or the Required Lenders, all payments received on account of the Obligations shall,
subject to  Sections 2.27  and  2.28 , be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows: 

first , to payment
of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts payable to the Administrative Agent
in its capacity as such; 

second , to payment
of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, reimbursement obligations
in respect of drawings under Letters of Credit, interest and Letters of Credit fees) payable to the Lenders (including fees and
disbursements and other charges of counsel) arising under the Loan Documents, ratably among them in proportion to the respective
amounts described in this clause second payable to them; 

third , to payment
of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid Letters of Credit fees and interest on the Loans and unreimbursed
borrowings under Letters of Credit, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause third
payable to them; 

fourth , to payment
of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans, unreimbursed borrowings under Letters of Credit
and amounts owing with respect to Specified Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Documents ratably among the Lenders, the Issuing
Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties and the Cash Management Counterparties in proportion to the respective amounts described in this
clause fourth payable to them; 

fifth , to Cash
Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprising the undrawn amount of Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise Cash
Collateralized by the Borrower pursuant to  Section 2.28 ;  provided  that (i) any such amounts applied pursuant
to this clause fifth shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the applicable Issuing Lenders to Cash
Collateralize such L/C Obligations, (ii) subject to  Section 3.5  or  2.28 , amounts used to Cash Collateralize
the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to this clause fifth shall be used to satisfy drawings under such Letters
of Credit as they occur and (iii) upon the expiration of any Letter of Credit, the  pro   rata  share of Cash Collateral
shall be distributed in accordance with this clause fifth; 

sixth , to the
payment in full of all other Obligations, in each case ratably among the applicable Secured Parties based upon the respective aggregate
amounts of all such Obligations owing to them in accordance with the respective amounts thereof then due and payable; and 

finally , the balance,
if any, after all Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law. 

If any amount remains
on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall
be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above. 

(i)           Application
of Payments Generally . All payments that would otherwise be allocated to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this  Section
2.18  shall instead be allocated  first , to repay interest on any portion of the Revolving Loans that the Administrative
Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender and on any Reimbursement Obligation, in each case for which the Administrative
Agent or, as the case may be, the Issuing Lender has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower, and  second ,
to pay the outstanding principal amount of the foregoing obligations. All repayments of any Revolving Loans or Term Loans shall
be applied  first , to repay such Loans outstanding as ABR Loans or Loans subject to a fixed rate of interest and  then ,
to repay such Loans outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, with those Eurodollar Loans having earlier expiring Interest Periods being
repaid prior to those having later expiring Interest Periods. If sufficient amounts are not available to pay in cash all outstanding
Obligations described in any priority level set forth in this  Section 2.18 , the available amounts shall be applied, unless
otherwise expressly specified herein, to such Obligations ratably based on the proportion of the Secured Parties  interest
in such Obligations. Any priority level set forth in this  Section 2.18  that includes interest shall include all such interest,
whether or not accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or
similar proceeding, and whether or not a claim for post-filing or post-petition interest is allowed in any such proceeding. While
an Event of Default is continuing, any payments or prepayments received by Administrative Agent shall be applied under  Section
2.18(h) . 

2.19          Requirements
of Law . (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance
by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority first made, in each case, subsequent to the date hereof: 

(i)          shall
impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition
of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder; 

(ii)         shall
subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition
of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations,
or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(iii)        shall
impose on such Lender any other condition not otherwise contemplated hereunder (other than with respect to any Taxes); 

and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan
or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other
Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in
or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing Lender or
other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Issuing Lender
or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall
promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. 

(b)          If
any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity
or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any
request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority
made, in each case, subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or
such corporation s capital or liquidity as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter
of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity)
by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a reasonably detailed written request therefor (consistent with the detail
provided by such Lender to similarly situated borrowers), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction. 

(c)          A
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent) with reasonable detail demonstrating how such amounts were derived shall be presumptively correct
in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required
to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor;  provided  that if the circumstances
giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such
retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
the payment of the Obligations. 

(d)          Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules,
guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder, issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, (ii) all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case, pursuant
to Basel III and (iii) the CRD IV and any law, rule, regulation or guideline, in each case that implements CRD IV in any jurisdiction,
shall in each case be deemed to be a change in a Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented. 

2.20          Taxes .
(a)  Payments Free of Taxes  .  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.
If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to
make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased
as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deduction or withholding been made. 

(b)           Payments
of Other Taxes by the Borrower  .  The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority, in accordance
with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 

(c)           Indemnification
by the Borrower  .  The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the
full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability with reasonable
supporting detail with respect thereto delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d)           Indemnification
by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i)
any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower have not already indemnified the Administrative
Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to
such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of  Section 10.6 , (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such
Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off
and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative
Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this  clause (d) . 

(e)           Evidence
of Payments  .  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant
to this  Section 2.20 , the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 

(f)           Status
of Lenders . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made
under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In
addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation
(other than such documentation set forth in  Section 2.20(f)(b)(i) ,  (b)(ii)  and  (b)(iv)  below) shall not be
required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any
material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 

(ii) Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, 

(1)           any
Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 

(2)           any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
whichever of the following is applicable: 

(A)         in
the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect
to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction
of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any
other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal
withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 

(B)         executed
originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 

(C)         in
the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x)
a certificate substantially in the form of  Exhibit I-1  to the effect that (I) such Foreign Lender is not a  bank 
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning
of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the
Code (a   U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate  ) and (II) the interest payments in question are not effectively connected
with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such Foreign Lender or are effectively connection but are not includible in the Foreign
Lender s gross income for U.S. federal tax withholding purposes under an income tax treaty and (y) executed originals of
IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or 

(D)         to
the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting
a typical participation, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E,
a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of  Exhibit I-2  or  Exhibit I-3 , IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;  provided  that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership
(and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio
interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of  Exhibit I-4 
on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 

(3)           any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S.
federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law
to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

(4)           if
a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b)
of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed
by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA
or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iv),  FATCA 
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 

(5)           Each
Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect,
it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal
inability to do so. 

(g)           Treatment
of Certain Refunds  .  If a Recipient determines, in its sole discretion (exercised in good faith), that it has received
a refund or credit of any Indemnified Taxes as to which additional amounts have been paid or as to which it has been indemnified
pursuant to this  Section 2.20 , it shall pay over such refund or credit to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid), net of expenses of such Recipient;  provided ,  however , that the Borrower,
upon the request of the Recipient, shall repay to such Recipient the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest
or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) that is required to be repaid after receipt of written notice
setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of such amount and certifying that the Recipient is required to repay such refund
to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  clause (g) , in no event will the indemnified
Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this  clause (g)  the payment of which would place such
Recipient in a less favorable after-tax position than such party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional
amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This  clause (g)  shall not be construed to require any Recipient
to make available its Tax Returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower
or any other Person or to require any Recipient to apply for a refund of Taxes. 

(h)           Survival .
Each party s obligations under this  Section 2.20  shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative
Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction
or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 

2.21          Indemnity .
The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense (other than lost profits,
including the Applicable Margin) that such Lender may actually sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower
in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting
the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion
from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c)
the making of a prepayment, conversion or continuation of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period
with respect thereto. A reasonably detailed certificate as to (showing in reasonable detail the calculation of) any amounts payable
pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be presumptively correct in the absence of manifest error.
This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations. 

2.22          Illegality .
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation
or application thereof, in each case, made after the date hereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower,
and (i) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert ABR Loans
to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended during the period of such illegality and (ii) such Lender s Loans then outstanding
as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest
Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. 

(b)          If
any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to  Section 2.21 . 

2.23          Mitigation
of Costs; Change of Lending Office . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation
of  Section 2.19 ,  2.20(a) ,  2.21  or  2.22  with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower,
use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans
affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;  provided  that such designation is made
on terms that, in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no material
economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and;  provided , further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone
any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to  Section 2.19 ,  2.20(a)  or  2.22 . 

2.24          Replacement
of Lenders . The Borrower shall be permitted to replace with a financial institution any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement
for amounts owing pursuant to  Section 2.19 ,  2.20  or  2.21  (to the extent a request made by a Lender pursuant
to the operation of  Section 2.21  is materially greater than requests made by other Lenders) or gives a notice of illegality
pursuant to  Section 2.22 , (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder, or (c) that (x) is a Defaulting Lender
or (y) has refused to consent to any waiver or amendment with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby or of each Lender and has been consented to by the Required Lenders;  provided  that (i) such replacement
does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans
and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (iii) the Borrower shall be liable to such
replaced Lender under  Section 2.21  (as though  Section 2.21  were applicable) if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such
replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (iv) the replacement
financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to the extent that
an assignment to such replacement financial institution of the rights and obligations being acquired by it would otherwise require
the consent of the Administrative Agent pursuant to  Section 10.6(c) , (v) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make
such replacement in accordance with the provisions of  Section 10.6 , (vi) the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if
any) required pursuant to  Section 2.19  or  2.20 , as the case may be, in respect of any period prior to the date on
which such replacement shall be consummated, (vii) if applicable, the replacement financial institution shall consent to such
amendment or waiver and (viii) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. 

2.25          Incremental
Facilities . (a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative
Agent elect to request (i) prior to the Revolving Termination Date, one or more increases in the amount of Revolving Commitments
(each, a   Revolving Facility Increase  ) or (ii) prior to the Term Maturity Date, the establishment of one or
more new term loan commitments which may be of the same tranche as such existing Term Loans (each, a   Term Loan Increase  )
or a separate tranche of new term loans (collectively with any Term Loan Increase, the   New Term Commitments  
and the New Term Commitments, collectively with any Revolving Facility Increase, the   Incremental Commitments  ).
Each Incremental Commitment shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $5,000,000 individually and in integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amount of Incremental Commitments
and Incremental Notes issued pursuant to  Section 2.26  shall not, individually or in the aggregate, exceed the Incremental
Amount. Each such notice shall specify (A) the date (each, an   Increased Amount Date  ) on which the Borrower
proposes that such Incremental Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date after the date on which such notice is delivered
to the Administrative Agent and (B) the identity of each existing Lender or other Person that is an Assignee (each, a   New
Revolving Lender   or   New Term Lender ,  as applicable) to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of
such Incremental Commitments, be allocated and the amounts of such allocations;  provided  that (w) any Lender approached
to provide all or a portion of the Incremental Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide an Incremental
Commitment (it being understood that there is no obligation to approach any existing Lenders to provide any Incremental Commitment),
(x) each of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall have consented to such Person s
providing such Incremental Commitments if such consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, respectively,
would be required under  Section 10.6  for an assignment of Loans or Commitments to such Person (in each case, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, except to the extent that the Borrower may grant such consent in its sole discretion in the instances
specifically described in  Section 10.6 ), (y) with respect to New Term Commitments, any Affiliated Lender providing a New
Term Commitment shall be subject to the same restrictions set forth in  Section 10.6(c)  as it would otherwise be subject
to with respect to any purchase by or assignment to such Affiliated Lender of Term Loans and (z) Affiliated Lenders may not provide
any Revolving Facility Increase. Such Incremental Commitments shall become effective, as of such Increased Amount Date;  provided 
that (1) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on or prior to such Increased Amount Date after giving effect to such
Incremental Commitments, as applicable ( provided  that, if the primary purpose of such Incremental Commitments is to finance
a Permitted Acquisition or a similar Investment constituting a Limited Condition Acquisition permitted under  Section 7.7 ,
then the foregoing shall  mean (x) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on or prior to the date the applicable acquisition
agreement is executed and (y) no Specified Event of Default as of the Increased Amount Date ); (2) the Incremental Commitments
(x) shall not be guaranteed by any Person that is not a Guarantor and (y) shall be unsecured or secured only by Property constituting
the Collateral (and if secured on a junior basis shall be subject to customary intercreditor arrangements reasonably acceptable
to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower); (3) the Incremental Commitments, as applicable, shall be effected pursuant to one
or more Joinder Agreements (each, an   Incremental Joinder Agreement  ) executed and delivered by the Borrower,
the New Revolving Lender or New Term Lender, as applicable, and to the extent applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Lender, or another form of incremental amendment, each of which shall be recorded in the Register; (4) the Borrower shall pay,
or cause to be paid, all fees and expenses owing in respect of such Incremental Commitments to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent and the Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender); (5) the representations and warranties of Holdings, the Borrower and
its Restricted Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects (or, in the case of any such representation or warranty already qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect,
it shall be true in all respects) on and as of such Increased Amount Date except to the extent that such representations and warranties
specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date;  provided  that,
if the primary purpose of such Incremental Commitments is to finance a Permitted Acquisition or a similar Investment constituting
a Limited Condition Acquisition permitted under  Section 7.7 , (x) the representations and warranties of Holdings, the Borrower
and its Restricted Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects (or, in the case of any such representation or warranty already qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect,
it shall be true in all respects) on and as of the date the applicable acquisition agreement is executed, except to the extent
that such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be so true and correct
as of such earlier date, and (y) the Specified Representations (other than Section 4.17 with respect to the target in such Permitted
Acquisition or investment and its subsidiaries)  as of the Increased Amount Date ; (6) the Administrative Agent shall have
received such legal opinions and other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith; and
(7) the Flood Insurance Requirements shall be satisfied with respect to each Mortgaged Property (if any). 

(b)          On
any Increased Amount Date on which a Revolving Facility Increase is effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms
and conditions, (a) each Revolving Facility Increase shall be deemed for all purposes a Revolving Commitment and each Loan made
thereunder shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Loan and (b) each New Revolving Lender shall become a Lender with respect
to the Revolving Facility Increase and all matters relating thereto. 

(c)          Any
New Term Loans effected through the establishment of one or more New Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated
a separate tranche of New Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement. On any Increased Amount Date on which any New Term Commitments
of any tranche are effected (including through any Term Loan Increase), subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and
conditions, (i) each New Term Lender of such tranche shall make a Loan to the Borrower (a   New Term Loan  ) in
an amount equal to its New Term Commitment of such tranche, and (ii) each New Term Lender of such tranche shall become a Lender
hereunder with respect to the New Term Commitment of such tranche and the New Term Loans of such tranche made pursuant thereto.
On any Increased Amount Date on which any Revolving Facility Increase is effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing
terms and conditions, (i) each New Revolving Lender of such Revolving Facility Increase shall make its Commitment available to
the Borrower in an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Facility Increase, and (ii) each New Revolving Lender
of such Revolving Facility Increase shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Revolving Facility Increase and the Revolving
Loans made pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, New Term Loans may have identical terms to the Term Loans and be treated
as the same tranche as the Term Loans. 

(d)          The
Administrative Agent shall notify Lenders promptly upon receipt of the Borrower s notice of each Increased Amount Date and
in respect thereof (x) the Revolving Facility Increase and the New Revolving Lenders of such Revolving Facility Increase or the
tranche of New Term Commitments and the New Term Lenders of such tranche, as applicable, and (y) in the case of each notice to
any Revolving Lender with respect to an increase in the applicable Revolving Commitments, the respective interests in such Revolving
Lender s Revolving Commitments, in each case subject to the assignments contemplated by clause (b) of this  Section 2.25 . 

(e)          The
terms, provisions and documentation of the New Term Loans and New Term Commitments of any tranche shall be as agreed between the
Borrower and the New Term Lenders providing such New Term Loans and New Term Commitments, and except as otherwise set forth herein,
to the extent not identical to the Term Loans, shall be reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. In any event: 

(i)          the
Weighted Average Life to Maturity of all New Term Loans of any tranche shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity
of the then outstanding Term Loans on the date of incurrence of such New Term Loans; 

(ii)         the
final maturity date of any tranche of the New Term Loans shall be no earlier than the original Term Maturity Date; 

(iii)        any
New Term Loans shall be on the same terms and pursuant to the same documentation as the Term Loans increased thereby or as may
be otherwise agreed between the Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments or New Term Loans and reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent; 

(iv)        the
New Term Loans may participate on a  pro   rata  basis or less than  pro   rata  basis (but not
on a greater than  pro   rata  basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of Term Loans hereunder, as specified
in the applicable Incremental Joinder Agreement; and 

(v)         the
New Term Loans will rank  pari   passu  in right of payment with existing Term Loans. 

(f)          The
terms, provisions and documentation of the Revolving Commitments and any Revolving Loans under the Revolving Facility Increase
shall be identical to the Revolving Loans and the Revolving Commitments and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section
2.25  or otherwise. 

(g)          Each
Incremental Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (and
in the case of any Revolving Facility Increase, the Issuing Lenders) to effect the provisions of this  Section 2.25  including,
to include the Lenders holding such facilities in any determination of Required Lenders and Majority Facility Lenders and to permit
the extensions of credit outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for the avoidance of doubt, this  Section 2.25  shall supersede any provisions
in  Section 10.1  or  10.7  to the contrary. 

(h)          The
Loans and Commitments extended or established pursuant to this  Section 2.25  and obligations of the Loan Parties in
connection therewith shall constitute Loans and Commitments and part of the Obligations under, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits afforded by, this Agreement and, except as expressly provided in the applicable Incremental Joinder Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Incremental Joinder Agreement,
benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantee Obligations and security interests created by the Security Documents. The Loan Parties
shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Lien granted by the
Collateral Documents continue to be perfected under the UCC or otherwise after giving effect to the extension or establishment
of any such Loans or any such Commitments. 

2.26          Incremental
Notes . 

(a)          The
Borrower may from time to time, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, specifying in reasonable detail the proposed terms
thereof, request to issue one or more series of senior secured or senior unsecured, senior subordinated or subordinated notes (which
notes, if secured, may either have the same Lien priority as the Obligations or may be secured by a Lien ranking junior to the
Lien securing the Obligations) (such notes, collectively,   Incremental Notes  ) in an aggregate amount, together
with the aggregate amount of any Incremental Commitments, not to exceed the Incremental Amount (at the time of issuance). 

(b)          As
conditions precedent to the issuance of any Incremental Notes pursuant to this Section: 

(i)          the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the date of issuance of such Incremental Notes (each,
an   Incremental Notes Effective Date  ) signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, certifying and attaching
the resolutions adopted by the Borrower (to the extent the Borrower is an issuer of such Incremental Notes) approving or consenting
to the issuance of such Incremental Notes, and certifying that the conditions precedent set forth in the following clauses (ii)
through (vii) have been satisfied; 

(ii)          such
Incremental Notes shall not be guaranteed by any Person that is not a Guarantor; 

(iii)         such
Incremental Notes will be unsecured or secured only by Property constituting the Collateral and subject to customary intercreditor
arrangements reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower; 

(iv)         such
Incremental Notes shall have a final maturity no earlier than the Latest Term Maturity Date then outstanding; 

(v)          the
Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Incremental Notes shall not be shorter than the then remaining Weighted Average Life
to Maturity of the then longest outstanding tranche of Term Loans; 

(vi)         the
covenants, terms and conditions and events of default applicable to such Incremental Notes shall not be more restrictive (other
than with respect to pricing, optional prepayment or redemption terms), when taken as a whole, than the covenants, terms and conditions
and Events of Default under the Loan Documents (except for provisions applicable only to periods following the later of the Latest
Revolving Termination Date and the Latest Term Maturity Date then in effect) unless the Borrower shall make such covenants, terms
and conditions applicable to the Loans pursuant to reasonably acceptable documentation to that effect; and 

(vii)        such
Incremental Notes shall not be subject to any mandatory redemption or prepayment provisions or rights, except to the extent any
such mandatory redemption or prepayment is required to be applied first  pro   rata  to the Term Loans and other Indebtedness
that is secured on a  pari   passu  basis with the Obligations. 

(c)          The
issuance of any Incremental Notes shall also be subject, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, to receipt
by the Administrative Agent of legal opinions, board resolutions, officers  certificates and/or reaffirmation agreements,
including any supplements or amendments to the Security Documents providing for such Incremental Notes to be secured thereby. The
Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with
the Borrower as may be necessary in order to secure any Incremental Notes with the Collateral and/or to make such technical amendments
as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the
issuance of such Incremental Notes, in each case on terms consistent with this  Section 2.26 . 

2.27          Defaulting
Lenders.  (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time
as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:     

(i)           such
Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in  Section 10.1  unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent; 

(ii)          any
payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender
(whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to  Section 8  or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent
from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to  Section 10.7  shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative
Agent as follows:  first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
 second , to the payment on a  pro   rata  basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the applicable
Issuing Lender(s) hereunder;  third , to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders  Fronting Exposure with respect to such
Defaulting Lender in accordance with  Section 2.28 ;  fourth , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default
exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required
by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;  fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released  pro   rata  in order to (A) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s
potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (B) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders 
future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement,
in accordance with  Section 2.28 ;  sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the applicable Issuing
Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the applicable Issuing Lenders
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;  seventh ,
so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations
under this Agreement; and,  eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
 provided  that if (A) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or amounts outstanding under any
Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (B) such Loans
or Letter of Credit draws were made at a time when the conditions set forth in  Section 5.2  were satisfied or waived, such
payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and the amounts outstanding under any Letters of Credit owed to, all the Non-Defaulting
Lenders on a  pro   rata  basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or amounts outstanding under any
Letters of Credit owed to, such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender
that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this clause (ii)
shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; 

(iii)         (A)
no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fees payable under  Section 2.9  for any period during which
such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required
to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender) and (B) each Defaulting Lender shall be limited in its right to receive fees in connection
with Letters of Credit as provided in  Section 3.3(c) ; and 

(iv)         all
or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders
in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment)
but only to the extent that (A) the conditions set forth in  Section 5.2  are satisfied at the time of such reallocation
(and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (B) such reallocation does not cause
the Revolving Extensions of Credit of any Non-Defaulting Lender at such time to exceed such Lender s Revolving Commitment.
Subject to  Section 10.20 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
against a Defaulting Lender arising from such Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 

(b)          If
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender,
the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject
to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), such Lender will, to
the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the
Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit
to be held  pro   rata  by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility (without giving
effect to  Section 2.27(a)(iv) ), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;  provided  that no
adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such
Lender was a Defaulting Lender;  provided , further, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected
parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from such Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 

(c)          So
long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, extend or amend any Letter
of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto. 

2.28          Cash
Collateral.  (a) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Lender if, three Business Days prior
to the Revolving Termination Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, or as otherwise required pursuant to
 Section 8.1 , the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all L/C
Obligations in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately
upon the written request of the Administrative Agent or any applicable Issuing Lender (in each case, with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), the Borrower shall repay the L/C Obligations, in the amount of all Fronting Exposure of such Issuing Lender with respect
to such Defaulting Lender or Cash Collateralize such Fronting Exposure in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount
(in each case, determined after giving effect to  Section 2.27(a)(iv)  and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting
Lender). 

(b)          All
Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, interest
bearing deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent. The Borrower and, to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby
grants to (and subject to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the applicable
Issuing Lenders and the applicable Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral,
deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and all proceeds of
the foregoing, as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to  clause (c) 
of this Section. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any
Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the
Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent,
pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. 

(c)           Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Cash Collateral provided under this Section,  Section 2.27  or  8.1  or otherwise
in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations
therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligations) and other
obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be
provided for herein. 

(d)          Cash
Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly
following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto, including by the
termination of the Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its Assignee following compliance with
 Section 10.6 ), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
 provided  that (A) Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower shall not be released during the continuance
of a Default under  Section 8.1(a)  or  (f)  or an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this
Section may be otherwise applied in accordance with  Section 8.1 ) and (B) the Person providing Cash Collateral
and the applicable Issuing Lender(s) may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure
or other obligations hereunder. 

2.29         Extensions
of Term Loans and Revolving Commitments.  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower may (i)
request that the Revolving Lenders extend the maturity of their Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans (and the related participations
in Letters of Credit) and that the Issuing Lenders extend the maturity of their respective L/C Commitments, and/or (ii) request
that the Term Lenders extend the maturity and amortization schedule of their Term Loans. In order to exercise such right, the Borrower
shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Revolving Lenders or
Term Lenders, as applicable) (the   Extension Request  ).    

(b)          The
Extension Request shall set forth the proposed terms of any Extended Lender Obligations to be established, which terms shall be
identical to those applicable to the tranche from which they are to be extended (such non-extended Revolving Commitments, the   Non-Extended
Revolving Commitments  , such non-extended Revolving Loans, the   Non-Extended Revolving Loans  , such
non-extended L/C Commitments, the   Non-Extended L/C Commitments  , and such non-extended Term Loans, the   Non-Extended
Term Loans  , and collectively, the   Non-Extended Lender Obligations  ) except (i) (x) the maturity
date of any Extended Lender Obligation shall be at least one year later than the Revolving Termination Date or the Term Maturity
Date, as applicable, and (y) the amortization schedule of the Term Loans may be extended, (ii) additional fees and different interest
rates may be payable to the Lenders providing any Extended Lender Obligations and (iii) Extended Lender Obligations may be subject
to covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Revolving Termination Date or the Term Maturity Date, as
applicable;  provided  that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 2.29  or otherwise in this
Agreement, (A) no Extended Lender Obligations shall be secured by or receive the benefit of any collateral, credit support or security
that does not secure or support the applicable Non-Extended Lender Obligations; (B) the repayment (other than in connection
with a permanent repayment and, if applicable, termination of commitments), the mandatory prepayment and the commitment reduction
of any Loans, Commitments or L/C Commitments applicable to any Extended Lender Obligation of any tranche shall be made on a  pro 
 rata  basis with all other outstanding Loans, Commitments or L/C Commitments (including all Extended Lender Obligations)
of such tranche ( provided  that Extended Lender Obligations may, if the Extending Lenders making or committing to any such
Extended Lender Obligations so agree, participate on a less than  pro   rata  basis in any voluntary or mandatory repayment
or prepayment or commitment reduction hereunder); (C) no Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Loans may be optionally prepaid
prior to the date on which the related Non-Extended Term Loans or Non-Extended Revolving Loans, as applicable, are repaid unless
such optional prepayment is accompanied by a  pro   rata  optional prepayment of the related Non-Extended Term Loans
or Non-Extended Revolving Loans, as applicable; (D) each Lender holding Loans and/or Commitments of any tranche shall be permitted
to participate in the related tranche of Extended Lender Obligations in accordance with its  pro   rata  share of the
Loans and/or Commitments of such tranche; (E) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on the Extension Date before or after
giving effect to any Extended Lender Obligations; (F) Extended Term Loans shall be treated as a separate tranche from Non-Extended
Term Loans ( provided  that Extended Revolving Commitments, Extended Revolving Loans, Non-Extended Revolving Commitments and
Non-Extended Revolving Loans shall be treated as a single tranche); and (G) the Flood Insurance Requirements shall be satisfied
with respect to each Mortgaged Property (if any). No Lender shall have any obligation to convert any Non-Extended Lender Obligations
held by it into Extended Lender Obligations pursuant to the Extension Request. 

(c)          The
Borrower shall provide the Extension Request at least 10 Business Days prior to the date on which Lenders under the applicable
tranche of Loans are requested to respond. Any Lender or Issuing Lender (an   Extending Lender  ) wishing to have
all or a portion of its Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments and/or L/C Commitments converted into Extended Lender Obligations
pursuant thereto shall notify the Administrative Agent (an   Extension Election  ) on or prior to the date specified
in such Extension Request of the amount of its applicable Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments and/or L/C Commitments that it
has elected to convert into Extended Lender Obligations. In the event that the aggregate amount of Term Loans and/or Revolving
Commitments and/or L/C Commitments subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Lender Obligations requested pursuant
to the Extension Request, Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments and/or L/C Commitments shall be converted to Extended Lender
Obligations on a  pro   rata  basis. The Borrower shall have the right to seek and accept Extended Lender Obligations
from (i) Lenders and/or (ii) third party financial institutions that are not then Lenders (each a   New Extending Lender  ),
in each case in an amount equal to the amount of the Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments and/or L/C Commitments of any Lender
or Issuing Lender that declines to become an Extending Lender (a   Declining Lender  ); provided that each Lender
shall have the right to increase its Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments and/or L/C Commitments up to the amount of the Declining
Lenders  Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments and/or L/C Commitments before the Borrower will be permitted to replace
a New Extending Lender for any Declining Lender. Each replacement of a New Extending Lender for a Declining Lender shall be effected
in accordance with Section 2.24. Each New Extending Lender under the Term Facility shall be subject to the prior written approval
of the Administrative Agent. Each Extending Lender under the Revolving Facility shall be subject to the prior written approval
of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any
obligation to extend any of its Commitments and any election to do so shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender. Any Lender
not responding by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date five Business Days prior to the date on which the Borrower proposes
that the Extended Lender Obligations shall be effective (which such date shall be at least 15 Business Days after the date the
Borrower has provided the applicable Extension Request) shall be deemed to have declined to extend its Commitments. 

(d)          Term
Loans, Revolving Commitments, Revolving Loans and L/C Commitments whose maturity is extended pursuant to this Section are referred
to as, in the case of Term Loans,   Extended Term Loans  , in the case of Revolving Commitments,   Extended
Revolving   Commitments  , in the case of Revolving Loans,   Extended Revolving   Loans  ,
and in the case of L/C Commitments,   Extended L/C Commitments  , respectively, and collectively are referred
to as   Extended Lender Obligations  . 

(e)          Extended
Lender Obligations shall be established pursuant to an amendment (the   Extension Amendment  ) to this Agreement
(which may include the amendments to provisions related to maturity, amortization, interest margins, fees or prepayments referenced
in  Section 2.29(b)  and which, in the case of Extended Revolving Commitments and Extended L/C Commitments, shall contain
provisions for the  pro   rata  treatment of borrowings, payments, voting and other matters between the Non-Extended
Revolving Commitments, on the one hand, and the Extended Revolving Commitments, on the other hand, for such period of time as Non-Extended
Revolving Commitments and Non-Extended L/C Commitments shall be in effect) executed by the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent,
and the Extending Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  Section 10.1 , no Extension Amendment
shall require the consent of any Lender other than the Extending Lenders with respect to the Extended Lender Obligations established
thereby. In connection with the Extension Amendment, the Guarantors shall reaffirm their respective obligations under the Guarantee
and Collateral Agreement pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall,
if requested by the Administrative Agent, deliver an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent as to
the enforceability of the Extension Amendment, this Agreement as amended thereby, the reaffirmation of the Guarantee and Collateral
Agreement and such of the other Loan Documents (if any) as may be amended thereby. In addition, the Extension Amendment shall contain
a representation and warranty by Holdings and the Borrower that the representations and warranties of (i) Holdings and the Borrower
contained in  Section 4  and (ii) each Loan Party contained in each other Loan Document or in any document furnished at any
time under or in connection herewith or therewith are true and correct in all material respects (or, if such representation or
warranty is itself modified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, it shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as
of the date of such Extension Amendment, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an
earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date. This Section shall supersede any provisions
in  Section 10.1  or  Section 10.7  to the contrary. Following the execution of the Extension Amendment, the Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of the percentage of the Revolving Facility or Term Facility that has been extended pursuant to
this  Section 2.29 . Until the Revolving Termination Date, all Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit shall be made or participated
in ratably by all Revolving Lenders and thereafter, all Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit shall be made or participated in
ratably by all Extending Lenders with Extended Revolving Commitments and all other Revolving Lenders to the extent required by
 Section 3 . 

(f)           Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) on any date on which any tranche of Term Loans and/or the Revolving
Commitments are converted to extend the scheduled maturity date in accordance with this Section (the   Extension Date  ),
the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans and/or Revolving Commitments of such tranche of each Extending Lender shall be deemed
reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Extended Lender Obligations relating to such tranche so converted
by such Lender on such date and (ii) if, on the Extension Date, any Extending Lender has elected to extend the maturity date
of some, but not all, of its portion of the Revolving Commitments, such Revolving Commitments (and such Lender s respective
Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations thereunder) shall each be allocated in the same proportion between the Non-Extended Revolving
Commitments and the Extended Revolving Commitments. 

2.30         Refinancing
Debt  .  

(a)          The
Borrower may, from time to time, and subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), add one or more new term loan facilities (each, a   Refinancing Term Facility  )
and/or new revolving credit facilities (each, a   Refinancing Revolving Facility   and the Refinancing Term Facilities
and Refinancing Revolving Facilities, collectively, the   Refinancing Debt  ) to the Facilities to refinance (x)
all or any portion of the Term Loans then outstanding under this Agreement, (y) all or any portion of the Revolving Loans then
outstanding (or unused Revolving Commitments) under this Agreement and/or (z) all or any portion of the Incremental Notes then
outstanding, in each case pursuant to procedures specified by the Administrative Agent in a Refinancing Amendment and reasonably
acceptable to the Borrower;  provided  that such Refinancing Debt: 

(i)           shall
not have a principal or commitment amount (or accreted value) greater than the Loans or Commitments, as applicable, being refinanced
(excluding accrued interest, fees, discounts, premiums or expenses); 

(ii)          will
rank  pari   passu  in right of payment as the other Loans and Commitments hereunder; 

(iii)         will
be unsecured or secured by Property constituting the Collateral on a  pari   passu  or junior basis with the Obligations
and shall be subject to customary intercreditor arrangements on terms reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent; 

(iv)         in
the case of any Refinancing Term Facility, shall not mature earlier than the Latest Term Maturity Date then in effect, or have
a Weighted Average Life to Maturity that is shorter than the then remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the then longest
outstanding tranche of Term Loans; 

(v)          in
the case of any Refinancing Revolving Facility, shall have a final maturity date later than the termination date of the Revolving
Loans (or unused Revolving Commitments) being refinanced, and shall not be subject to any amortization or other scheduled payments
of principal, mandatory prepayment or commitment reduction prior to such Revolving Termination Date; 

(vi)         in
the case of any Refinancing Term Facility, shall participate not more than ratably, or (if such Refinancing Term Facility is secured
by Property constituting the Collateral on a junior basis with the Obligations) on a junior basis, with the Obligations in any
voluntary or mandatory prepayments of Term Loans hereunder; 

(vii)        shall
not be guaranteed by any Person that is not a Guarantor; 

(viii)       shall
have material terms and conditions (other than terms with respect to interest rate and optional prepayment) that are not more favorable,
when taken as a whole, to the lenders providing such Refinancing Debt than, the terms and conditions of the Facilities and Loans
being refinanced, except for covenants or other provisions applicable only during periods after the later of the Latest Revolving
Termination Date and the Latest Term Maturity Date in effect at the time of such refinancing; and 

(ix)          the
Net Cash Proceeds of such Refinancing Debt shall be applied, substantially concurrently with the incurrence thereof, to the  pro 
 rata  prepayment of the outstanding Loans being so refinanced (and, in the case of Revolving Loans, a corresponding amount
of Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced). 

(b)          The
Borrower shall make any request for Refinancing Debt pursuant to a written notice to the Administrative Agent specifying in reasonable
detail the proposed terms thereof. Any proposed Refinancing Debt may be provided by existing Lenders, or (subject to the approval
of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) other Persons that meet the requirements
to be Assignees under  Section 10.6 , in such respective amounts as the Borrower may elect. 

(c)          The
effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set
forth in  Section 5.2  and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative
Agent of legal opinions, board resolutions, officer s certificates, reaffirmation agreements and/or other documents in connection
therewith, including any supplements or amendments to the Security Documents providing for such Refinancing Debt to be secured
thereby, consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date under  Section 5.1 . The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative
Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to
establish new tranches of Refinancing Debt and to make such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable
opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches, in each case on
terms consistent with and/or to effect the provisions of this  Section 2.30 . 

(d)          Each
class of Refinancing Debt incurred under this  Section 2.30  shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) not less
than $15,000,000 and (ii) an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any Refinancing Amendment may provide for the issuance
of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Refinancing Revolving Facility
established thereby, on terms substantially equivalent to the terms applicable to Letters of Credit under the Revolving Commitments.
The Loans and Commitments extended or established pursuant to this  Section 2.30  and obligations of the Loan Parties in connection
therewith shall constitute Loans and Commitments and part of the Obligations under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded
by, this Agreement, and except as expressly provided in the applicable Refinancing Amendment and intercreditor agreements (to the
extent contemplated by immediately preceding clause (a)(iii)), the other Loan Documents. 

(e)          The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties
hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent
(but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Refinancing Debt incurred pursuant thereto (including
the addition of such Refinancing Debt as separate  Facilities  and  tranches  hereunder and treated in
a manner consistent with the Facilities being refinanced, including for purposes of prepayments and voting). Any Refinancing Amendment
may, without the consent of any Person other than the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders providing such Refinancing
Debt, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable
opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this  Section 2.30 . In addition, if so
provided in the relevant Refinancing Amendment and with the consent of each Issuing Lender, participations in Letters of Credit
expiring on or after the Revolving Termination Date shall be reallocated from Lenders holding Revolving Commitments to Lenders
holding Extended Revolving Commitments in accordance with the terms of such Refinancing Amendment;  provided ,  however ,
that such participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the relevant Lenders holding Extended Revolving Commitments, be
deemed to be participation interests in respect of such Extended Revolving Commitments and the terms of such participation interests
(including the commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly. 

Section 3.   LETTERS OF CREDIT 

3.1           L/C
Commitment.  

(a)          Subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth
in  Section 3.4(a) , agrees to issue letters of credit (  Letters of Credit  ) for the account of the Borrower
or for the account of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (in which case the Borrower and Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be co-applicants with respect to such Letter of Credit) on any Business Day during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date in
such form as may be reasonably approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender;  provided  that no Issuing Lender shall
have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would
exceed the L/C Commitment, (ii) any Revolving Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender, unless such Issuing Lender has entered
into arrangements, including reallocation of such Lender s Revolving Percentage of the outstanding L/C Obligations pursuant
to  Section 2.27(a)(iv)  or the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such Issuing Lender with the Borrower or
such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Lender s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to  Section 2.27(a)(iv) )
with respect to such Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or such Letter of Credit and all
other L/C Obligations as to which such Issuing Lender has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion,
(iii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero or (iv) the outstanding L/C Obligations
in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender would exceed $8,750,000 less one-quarter of the Outstanding L/C Obligations
in respect of Existing Letters of Credit. The letters of credit issued, or deemed to be issued, pursuant to the Closing Date Indebtedness
and set forth on  Schedule 3.1(a)  hereof (the   Existing Letters of Credit  ) shall be deemed to be  Letters
of Credit  issued on the Effective Date for all purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Letter of Credit shall expire no later
than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance unless otherwise agreed by the Issuing Lender in its sole
discretion and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date;  provided  that, if requested
by the Borrower and acceptable to the applicable Issuing Lender, a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender may provide for
the renewal thereof for additional one year periods containing an expiry date of more than twelve months after the date of issuance
(which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above (unless, at least five Business Days prior to the
then current expiry date, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit in an
amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount applicable to such Letter of Credit));  provided , however, that (A) any
such Letter of Credit shall permit such Issuing Lender to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing
with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than at least 30
days (the   Nonrenewal Notice Date  ) in each such twelve-month period at the time such Letter of Credit is issued
and (B) such Issuing Lender shall not permit such renewal if it has received notice on or before the date that is seven Business
Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date from the Administrative Agent that the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the Revolving
Facility have elected not to permit such renewal. Each Letter of Credit shall be a standby letter of credit backing a performance
or monetary obligation of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (each a   Standby Letter of Credit  ). 

(b)          No
Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with any applicable
Requirement of Law. 

3.2           Procedure
for Issuance of Letter of Credit . The Borrower may from time to time request that the relevant Issuing Lender issue a Letter
of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified to the Borrower by such Issuing Lender an Application
therefor, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, completed to the reasonable satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may reasonably request. Upon receipt of any Application,
the relevant Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered
to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested
thereby (but in no event without the consent of the applicable Issuing Lender shall any Issuing Lender be required to issue any
Letter of Credit earlier than five Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates,
documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary
thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Such Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such
Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. Each Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative
Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the relevant Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by
it (including the amount thereof).    

3.3            Fees
and Other Charges . (a) The Borrower will pay a fee on each outstanding Standby Letter of Credit, at a  per   annum  rate
equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans under the Revolving Facility on the face amount
of such Standby Letter of Credit, which fees shall be shared ratably among the Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears
on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Lender for its own account
a fronting fee equal to 0.125% (or such greater percentage as agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Issuing Lender) per
annum on the aggregate face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it to the Borrower, payable quarterly in arrears
on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.    

(b)          In
addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such customary fees and expenses as
are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering
any Letter of Credit requested by the Borrower (which fees and expenses shall have been agreed to from time to time by the Borrower
and the relevant Issuing Lender). 

(c)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, any fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of
Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Lender shall
be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Revolving Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments
in their respective Revolving Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to  Section 2.27(a)(iv) , with
the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account. 

3.4           L/C
Participations.  (a) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce
such Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts
and purchases from such Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant s own account
and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant s Revolving Percentage in such Issuing Lender s obligations
and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing Lender
thereunder. Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid prior to the Revolving Credit Termination
Date under any Letter of Credit issued by it for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender
upon demand an amount equal to such L/C Participant s Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof,
that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant s obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such
L/C Participant may have against any Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence
or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in  Section
5 , (iii) any adverse change in the financial condition of Holdings, the Borrower, or their respective Subsidiaries, (iv) any
breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any L/C Participant or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.    

(b)          If
any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Issuing Lender pursuant
to  Section 3.4(a)  in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of
Credit is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such
payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender on demand an
amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period
from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing
Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator
of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to  Section 3.4(a)  is not made available
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after
the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount
with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate  per   annum  applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility.
A certificate of the relevant Issuing Lender submitted to any relevant L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under
this Section shall be presumptively correct in the absence of manifest error. 

(c)          Whenever,
at any time after any Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its
 pro   rata  share of such payment in accordance with  Section 3.4(a)  such Issuing Lender receives any payment
related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto
by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such L/C Participant its  pro   rata  share thereof;  provided , however, that in the event
that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant
shall return to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such
Issuing Lender to it. 

3.5           Reimbursement
Obligation of the Borrower . The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender in respect of any drawing under a Letter of
Credit on the immediately succeeding Business Day following receipt of notice by the Borrower from such Issuing Lender of a drawing
under a Letter of Credit and the date and amount of the relevant draft presented under such Letter of Credit (which reimbursement
shall include interest from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until such immediately succeeding Business Day at a rate
equal to the rate applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility). Each such payment shall be made to such Issuing Lender
at its address for notices specified to the Borrower and in immediately available funds. If the Borrower fails to reimburse in
whole or in part any Issuing Lender by the time set forth in the first sentence of this  Section 3.5 , the Borrower shall
be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan of ABR Loans to be disbursed on the date such reimbursement is due in an amount equal
to the amount of such outstanding reimbursement.    

3.6          Obligations
Absolute . The Borrower s obligations under this  Section 3  shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against
any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender
that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower  Reimbursement Obligations under  Section 3.5 
shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though
such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary
of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower
against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee, or any other events or circumstances that, pursuant to
applicable law or the applicable customs and practices promulgated by the International Chamber of Commerce, are not within the
responsibility of such Issuing Lender, except for errors or omissions resulting from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or
bad faith of such Issuing Lender or its employees or agents (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). No Issuing
Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice,
however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions resulting from the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith of such Issuing Lender or its employees or agents (as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction). The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter
of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) and in accordance with the standards or care specified in the UCC, shall be binding
on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower and that the Issuing Lender shall
be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  T he Borrower hereby waives any claim against any Issuing Bank
and its employees and agents, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender s or its employees or agents 
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the
terms thereof.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with
respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit,
the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents
if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.    

3.7           Letter
of Credit Payments . If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection
with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall, in addition to any payment
obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft)
delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
To the extent not inconsistent with  Section 3.6 , the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying upon, any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Issuing Lender.    

3.8          Applications   .
To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this

not, and shall not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to and, with respect to  Sections 7.1 ,  7.10 ,  7.11

Covenant  .

Total Leverage Ratio . Permit the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio calculated as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of Borrower
commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016 to exceed 4.00 to 1.00;  provided  that such Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio shall step up to 4.25:1.00 starting with the Fiscal Quarter as of and following the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition;
 provided , further that, if the step up option occurs pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso, there shall be a step
down to 4.00:1.00 starting with the Fiscal Quarter ending three Fiscal Quarters following such step up. 

(b)           Certain
Cure Rights . 

(i)           Financial
Condition Covenant . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event the Borrower fails to comply with
the requirements of the covenant as set forth in  Section 7.1(a)  (the   Financial Condition Covenant  )
as at the last day of any fiscal quarter (a fiscal quarter ending on such day, a   Curable Period  ), after the
Closing Date until the expiration of the 10th Business Day subsequent to the date the financial statements are required to be delivered
pursuant to  Sections 6.1(a)  or  (b) , as applicable, with respect to the period ending on the last day of such fiscal
quarter, Holdings or its direct or indirect parent shall have the right (the   Cure Right  ) to issue Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Capital Stock) for cash (the proceeds received by Holdings and contributed in cash as common equity
to the Borrower as a result of such issuance, the   Cure Amount  ). Upon the receipt by the Borrower of cash in
an amount equal to the Cure Amount pursuant to the exercise of such Cure Right the Financial Condition Covenant shall be recalculated
giving effect to the following pro forma adjustments: 

(A)         Consolidated
EBITDA for the Curable Period shall be increased, solely for the purpose of measuring the Financial Condition Covenant for such
fiscal quarter and for applicable subsequent periods which include such fiscal quarter, and disregarded for any other purpose under
this Agreement (including determining the availability of any baskets and step-downs), by an amount equal to the Cure Amount; and 

(B)         if,
after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the Financial
Condition Covenant, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Condition Covenant as of the
relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the
applicable breach or default of the Financial Condition Covenant which had occurred shall be deemed cured for all purposes of this
Agreement. 

(ii)          Limitations
on Exercise of Cure Right, etc . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) in no event shall the Borrower be entitled
to exercise the Cure Right more than twice in any consecutive four-quarter period or more than four times during the term of this
Agreement and (B) the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount which, if added to Consolidated EBITDA for the Curable Period,
would cause Borrower to be in compliance with the Financial Condition Covenant for the relevant determination period ending on
the last day of such Curable Period (it being understood and agreed that for purposes of calculating such amount no effect in such
calculation shall be given to any prepayment of Loans with such proceeds or to any other reduction of Consolidated Total Debt or
Consolidated Interest Expense on account of the receipt of such proceeds). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
to the extent a fiscal quarter ended for which the Financial Condition Covenant is initially recalculated as a result of a Cure
Right is included in the calculation of the Financial Condition Covenant in a subsequent fiscal period, the Cure Amount shall be
included in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA for such fiscal quarter when calculating the Financial Condition Covenant for such
subsequent fiscal period. Upon the Administrative Agent s receipt of an irrevocable notice from the Borrower that it intends
to exercise the Cure Right with respect to the Financial Condition Covenant as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (the   Notice
of Intent to Cure  ), then, until the 10th Business Day subsequent to the date the financial statements are required to
be delivered pursuant to  Sections 6.1(a)  or  (b) , as applicable, to which such Notice of Intent to Cure relates, neither
the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall exercise the right to accelerate the Loans or terminate the Revolving Commitments
and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall exercise any right to foreclose on or take possession of the Collateral
solely on the basis of an Event of Default having occurred and being continuing under  Section 7.1(a)  in respect of the period
ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter.

(h)          one
or more monetary judgments or decrees shall be entered against Holdings, the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries involving,
for Holdings, the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, a liability (to the extent not paid or covered by
insurance or effective indemnity) of $25,000,000 or more, and such judgments or decrees shall not have been vacated, discharged,
stayed or bonded pending appeal within 30 days from the entry thereof; or 

(i)          (i)

Party not to be a legal, valid and binding obligation of any party thereto, (ii) any security interest purported to be created
by any Security Document to extend to Collateral that is not immaterial to the Loan Parties on a consolidated basis shall cease
to be, or shall be asserted in writing by any Loan Party not to be, a valid and perfected security interest (having the priority
required by this Agreement or the relevant Security Document) in the securities, assets or properties covered thereby, except to

force and effect, or Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall contest in any manner the validity, binding nature
or enforceability of any such provision; 

then, and in any such event, (A) if such
event is an Event of Default specified in  clauses (i) ,  (ii) ,  (iii)  or  (iv)  of  clause (f)  above
with respect to the Borrower, automatically the Commitments shall immediately terminate and the Loans hereunder (with accrued interest
thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall immediately become due and payable,
and (B) if such event is any other Event of Default, with the consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or
upon the request of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Loans hereunder
(with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be due and payable
forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable. In the case of all Letters of Credit with respect to which
presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall at
such time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn
and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit
shall have expired or been backstopped or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the Borrower
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all
Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations of the Borrower then due and owing hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents shall have been paid in full (other than contingent or indemnification obligations not then asserted
or due), the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the Borrower (or such other Person as may be
lawfully entitled thereto). Except as expressly provided above in this Section or otherwise in any Loan Document, presentment,
demand and protest of any kind are hereby expressly waived by Holdings and the Borrower. 

Section 9.   THE AGENTS 

9.1            Appointment .
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers
as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The provisions of this Section are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders (including the Issuing
Lenders), and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed
that the use of the term  agent  herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to
any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties. 

Each Issuing Lender shall
act on behalf of the Revolving Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
and each Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (a) provided to the Agents in this Section with respect
to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to
be issued by it and documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term  Agent  as used in this
Section and the definition of  Agent-Related Person  included such Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or omissions,
and (b) as additionally provided herein with respect to each Issuing Lender. 

9.2            Delegation
of Duties . The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under
any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective
Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication
of the Facilities as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable
judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 

9.3            Exculpatory
Provisions . (a) No Agent, Joint Bookrunner, Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent or Syndication Agent shall have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative
in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent, Joint Bookrunner, Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent or
Syndication Agent shall: (i) be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is then continuing; (ii) have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except (in the case of the Administrative Agent) discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the
other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents);  provided 
that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may
expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance
of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture,
modification or termination of Property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and (iii) except as
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure
to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by
such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 

(b)          The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall
believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in  Section 8  and/or  Section 10.1 ),
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
by final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence
of any Default unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender, an Issuing Lender or
the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a  notice of default.  

(c)          No
Agent-Related Person shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any
Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 5 or elsewhere herein,
other than (in the case of the Administrative Agent) to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to it. 

9.4            Reliance
by the Agents . Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet
website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by
the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to any Borrowing or any draft under any Letter of Credit that by its terms shall be fulfilled to the satisfaction of
a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such
Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender
prior to any such Borrowing or Letter of Credit draft. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel
for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 

9.5            Non-Reliance
on Agents and Other Lenders . Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agents
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness
of the Loan Parties and their Affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under the applicable Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
Affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agents hereunder,
the Agents shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate
of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of either Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or Affiliates. 

9.6            Indemnification .
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Lender shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related
Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the obligations of any Loan Party to
do so) on a  pro   rata  basis (determined as of the time that the applicable payment is sought based on each Lender s
ratable share at such time) and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
it;  provided  that (a) no Lender shall be liable for payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person s own gross negligence or willful misconduct (and no action taken in accordance with the directions
of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the
other Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section) and (b) to
the extent any Issuing Lender is entitled to indemnification under this Section solely in its capacity and role as an Issuing Lender
only the Revolving Lenders shall be required to indemnify such Issuing Lender in accordance with this Section (determined as of
the time that the applicable payment is sought based on each Revolving Lender s Revolving Percentage thereof at such time).
In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section applies whether
any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including
the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of, or legal advice in respect of rights and responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated
by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such costs or expenses by or on behalf
of the Borrower. 

To the extent required
by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any U.S. federal
income Tax. If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold
U.S. federal income Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or
was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered
the exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal income Tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if the Administrative Agent
reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding
tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly,
by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all reasonable costs and
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in connection therewith. 

9.7            Agent
in Its Individual Capacity . Any Agent shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent hereunder, and the term  Lender  or  Lenders 
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as such Agent
hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of,
act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders. 

9.8            Successor
Agents . The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days  notice to the Lenders, the Issuing
Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders
a successor agent (which may be an Affiliate of a Lender), with the consent of the Borrower at all times other than during the
existence of an Event of Default (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no such successor shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders (with, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the consent
of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) and shall have accepted such appointment prior to
the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set
forth above (including, without limitation, the consent of the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event
of Default (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)). Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such
resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on such effective date, where (i) the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case
of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders under any of the Loan
Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) continue to hold such collateral security until
such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided
to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and Issuing Lender directly, until
such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance
of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all
of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower
to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower
and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the
provisions of this Section and  Section 9.3  shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative
Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 

If the Person serving
as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent
and, with the consent of the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders)
(the   Removal Effective Date  ), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such
notice on the Removal Effective Date. 

9.9           Authorization
to Release Liens and Guarantees . The Agents are hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders to effect any release
or subordination of Liens or Guarantee Obligations contemplated by  Section 10.15  without further action or consent by the
Lenders.

Arrangers . None of the Lead Arrangers, Joint Bookrunners, Documentation Agent or Syndication Agent identified on the cover
page of this Agreement shall have any rights, powers, obligations, liabilities, responsibilities or duties under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, a
Lender or an Issuing Lender hereunder. Without limiting any other provision of this Section 9, none of the Lead Arrangers, Joint
Bookrunners, Documentation Agent or Syndication Agents in their respective capacities as such shall have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender (including any Issuing Lender) or any other Person by reason of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document. 

9.11         Administrative
Agent May File Proofs of Claim . In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation
shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative
Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding

file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, all L/C Obligations
and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order

to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due
for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and
any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under  Sections 2.9  and  10.5(a) .

addition, notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly
identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents,
then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision, and, in each case, such amendment shall
become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document if the same is not objected to in
writing by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.

10.3         No
Waiver; Cumulative Remedies . No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of any Agent or any Lender, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 

10.4         Survival
of Representations and Warranties . All representations and warranties made hereunder, in the other Loan Documents and in any

Liabilities  ) regardless of whether such Indemnitee is a party thereto, and whether or not any such claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its equity holders, its respective Affiliates, its respective creditors
or any other Person;  provided  that neither Holdings nor the Borrower shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee

assigning Lender and Affiliated Lender or Purchasing Borrower Party purchasing such Lender s Term Loans, as applicable, shall

(iv)        for
the avoidance of doubt, Lenders shall not be permitted to assign Revolving Commitments or Revolving Loans to any Affiliated Lender

Borrower Party);

Term Loans assigned to any Purchasing Borrower Party (or purchased or prepaid by Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary)
acting in accordance with this  Section 10.6(c)  shall be automatically and permanently cancelled upon the effectiveness of
such assignment and will thereafter no longer be outstanding for any purpose hereunder;

Term Loan may be assigned to (x) except as set forth in clause (k) below, an Affiliated Lender pursuant to this  Section 10.6(c) ,

void  ab   initio  and the Register shall be modified to reflect a reversal of such assignment and (y) a Purchasing Borrower
Party pursuant to this  Section 10.6(c) , if after giving effect to such assignment, Purchasing Borrower Parties together
in the aggregate would own in excess of 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding, and any assignments
to Purchasing Borrower Parties that would cause the Purchasing Borrower Parties in the aggregate to hold in excess of 25% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding shall be deemed void  ab   initio  and the Register shall
be modified to reflect a reversal of such assignment; 

(viii)       such
Affiliated Lender or Purchasing Borrower Party represents and warrants that it is not in possession of material non-public information
within the meaning of the United States federal securities laws with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or Subsidiary, or the respective
securities of any of the foregoing, at the time of such purchase that has not been disclosed to the Lenders (other than Lenders
that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary) prior to
such time; 

(d)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Affiliated Lender shall have any right to (I) attend (including by telephone) any
meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the Loan Parties
are not invited, (II) receive any information or material prepared by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication
by or among the Administrative Agent and/or one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made
available to any Loan Party or its representatives (and in any case, other than the right to receive notices of prepayments and
other administrative notices in respect of its Loans required to be delivered to Lenders) or (III) make or bring (or participate
in, other than as a passive Participant in or Recipient of its  pro   rata  benefits of) any claim, in its capacity as
a Lender, against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender with respect to any duties or obligations
or alleged duties or obligations of such Agent or any other such Lender under the Loan Documents. 

(e)          Notwithstanding
anything in  Section 10.1  or the definition of  Required Lenders  to the contrary, for purposes of determining
whether the  Required Lenders  have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent
or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (ii) otherwise
acted on any matter related to any Loan Document or (iii) directed or required the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document, all Term Loans
held by any Affiliated Lender shall be deemed to have voted in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to
such matter by Lenders who are not Affiliated Lenders for all purposes of calculating whether the Required Lenders have taken any
actions;  provided  that this clause (e) shall not apply with respect to any amendment, modification, waiver or consent (A)
described in clauses (i)   (iv), (vii) and (viii) of  Section 10.1(a)  (which, for the avoidance of doubt, such Affiliated
Lender would not be permitted to vote on (x) any change to the component definitions of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or
the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or (y) any amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to  Section 7.9 ) or
(B) that disproportionately, directly and adversely affects such Affiliated Lender. 

(f)          Each
Affiliated Lender hereby agrees that if a case under Title 11 of the United States Code is commenced against any Loan Party, each
such Affiliated Lender shall consent to provide that the vote of such Affiliated Lender (in its capacity as a Lender) with respect
to any plan of reorganization of such Loan Party shall be deemed to have voted in the same proportion as the allocation of voting
with respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Affiliated Lenders, except that such Affiliated Lender s vote (in its
capacity as a Lender) may be counted to the extent any such plan of reorganization proposes to treat the Obligations held by such
Affiliated Lender in a manner that is less favorable in any respect to such Affiliated Lender than the proposed treatment of similar
Obligations held by Lenders that are not Affiliates of the Borrower. Each Affiliated Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative
Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Affiliated Lender s attorney-in-fact, with full authority
in the place and stead of such Affiliated Lender and in the name of such Affiliated Lender, from time to time in the Administrative
Agent s discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary
to carry out the provisions of this clause (f). 

(g)          In
no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is an Affiliated
Lender nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to monitor the number of Affiliated Lenders or the aggregate amount of Term
Loans or Incremental Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders. 

(h)          Any
Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower (except as otherwise provided below) or the Administrative Agent sell participations
to one or more banks or other entities (a   Participant  ), but in any event not to Holdings, the Borrower or
any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or a Person that the Administrative Agent has identified in a notice to the
Lenders as a Defaulting Lender, in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);  provided  that (A) such Lender s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations, (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (D)
any sale of a participation to an Affiliated Lender shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Borrower in its sole discretion.
Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided 
that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification
or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second
sentence of  Section 10.1  and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to  clause (h)(i)  of this Section,
the Borrower agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of  Sections 2.19 ,  2.20  and  2.21 
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to  clause (b)  of this Section. 

(i)          A
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under  Section 2.19  or  2.20  than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant except to the extent such entitlement
to receive any greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable Participation
or, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower  prior written consent. No Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of  Section 2.20  unless such Participant complies with  Section 2.20(f) , as
(and to the extent) applicable, as if such Participant were a Lender. 

(ii)         Each
Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register
on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s
interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the   Participant Register  );  provided 
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of
any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such
commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative
Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 

(i)          Any
Lender may, without the consent of or notice to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower (except as set forth below), at any time
pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to (i) a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank or (ii) any holder
of, or trustee for the benefit of the holders of, such Lender s Capital Stock, voting trust certificates, bonds, debentures,
instruments and other evidence of Indebtedness, and all warrants, options and other rights to acquire the foregoing, and this Section
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;  provided  that no such pledge or assignment of a
security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto;  provided , further that any such pledge or assignment of a security interest to an Affiliated Lender
is subject to the prior written consent of the Borrower in its sole discretion. The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from
the relevant Lender, agree to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in this
 clause (i) . 

(j)          In
connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective
unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional
payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be
outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding,
with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable ratable share of Loans previously requested but not
funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay
and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender
and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full ratable
share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Revolving Percentage;  provided  that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective
under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this  clause (j) , then the assignee of such interest shall
be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 

(k)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no assignment or participation may be made to Macquarie Group Limited or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (including without limitation any fund managed or controlled thereby or any investment scheme or similar vehicle or separate
managed account related thereto), except with the prior written consent of the Borrower in its sole discretion. 

10.7          Adjustments;
Set-off . (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the
Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a   Benefited Lender  ) shall at any time receive any payment
of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in  Section 8.1(f) , or otherwise), other than in connection
with assignments hereunder, in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any,
in respect of such other Lender s Obligations, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
interest in such portion of each such other Lender s Obligations, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of
any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral
ratably with each of the Lenders;  provided ,  however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits
is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. 

(b)          In
addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the
Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming
due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) after the expiration of
any cure or grace periods, to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final but excluding trust accounts, employee benefit accounts, payroll, petty cash, tax and withholding
accounts and the like), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct
or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof
to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower;  provided  that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise
any such right of setoff, (i) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further
application in accordance with the provisions of  Section 2.23  and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such
Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders
and the Lenders and (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing
in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender;
 provided  that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

10.9          Severability .

to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provision of this
Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative

a) 

           Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

           Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
