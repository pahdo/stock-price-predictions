NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

1.  Description of Business 

Mewbourne Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the
 Registrant  or the  Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership, is engaged primarily in oil and gas
development and production in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on November 16, 2005. The offering of limited
and general partnership interests began July 11, 2006 as a part of an offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners
06-07 Drilling Program, (the  Program ), and concluded September 1, 2006, with total investor contributions of $50,000,000
originally being sold to 1,576 subscribers of which $43,174,000 were sold to 1,342 subscribers as general partner interests and
$6,826,000 were sold to 234 subscribers as limited partner interests. During, 2008, all general partner equity interests were converted
to limited partner equity interests. In accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne Development Corporation ( MD ),
a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Partnership s managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest
in the Partnership. 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Reference is hereby made to the Registrant s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2015, which contains a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Partnership in
the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing the quarterly report included herein. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present fairly our financial position,
results of operations, cash flows and partners  capital for the periods presented. The results of operations for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the full year. In preparing these financial statements,
the Partnership has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date the financial statements
were issued. 

3.  Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities 

The Partnership follows the full-cost method
of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of
oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying
the oil and gas properties. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, all capitalized costs were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the
sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses are not recognized unless such adjustments
would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are
subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net cash flows
of proved reserves, computed using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices, discounted
at 10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. If unamortized costs capitalized exceed the ceiling, the excess
is charged to expense in the period the excess occurs. There were cost ceiling write-downs totaling $1,108,687 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. There were no cost ceiling write-downs for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

4.  Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Partnership has recognized an estimated
asset retirement obligation liability (ARO) for future plugging and abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value
of the future plugging and abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new
well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with
the full cost methodology. 

The Partnership estimates a liability for
plugging and abandonment costs based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted
risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives,
or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection
with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well. 

A reconciliation of the Partnership s
liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31,
2015 is as follows: 

5.  Related Party Transactions 

In accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware, MD has been appointed as the Partnership s managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in
the Partnership. Mewbourne Oil Company ( MOC ) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne
Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC. 

In the ordinary course of business, MOC
will incur certain costs that will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The Partnership will receive
their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as operator
charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed
rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which will be included in the full cost pool
pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in accordance with the program and partnership
agreements. 

In accordance with the Partnership agreement,
during any particular calendar year the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed
the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production during each year
(calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital
contributions of limited and general partners. 

The Partnership participates in oil and
gas activities through the Program. The Partnership and MD are the parties to the Program, and the costs and revenues are allocated
between them as follows: 

Partnership       
     MD (1)     
 
     Revenues:    

Proceeds from disposition of depreciable and depletable properties    
        70  %    
        30  %  
 
     All other revenues    
        70  %    
        30  %  
 
     Costs and expenses:    

Organization and offering costs (1)    
        0  %    
        100  %  
 
     Lease acquisition costs (1)    
        0  %    
        100  %  
 
     Tangible and intangible drilling costs (1)    
        100  %    
        0  %  
 
     Operating costs, reporting and legal expenses, general and    

administrative expenses and all other costs    
        70  %    
        30  %  

(1)  As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20% of total capital costs. To the extent that organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs are less than 20% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share
of the Program s total capital costs reaches approximately 20%. The Partnership s financial statements reflect its
respective proportionate interest in the Program.   

Item 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Mewbourne Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the
 Partnership ) was formed November 16, 2005. The offering of limited and general partnership interests began July 11,
2006 and concluded September 1, 2006, with total investor contributions of $50,000,000. During 2008, all general partner equity
interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. 

Future capital requirements and operations
will be conducted with available funds generated from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is anticipated. The Partnership
had net working capital of $193,253   at September 30, 2016. 

The Partnership had reduced cash flows
from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the steep decline in oil and gas prices during the previous
twelve months. Considering these reduced operating cashflows, the Partnership anticipates smaller distributions until prices improve. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Partnership made cash distributions to the investor partners (including state tax payments for the benefit of investor
partners) in the amount of $308,301 as compared to $767,571 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Since inception, the
Partnership has made distributions of $56,684,123, inclusive of state tax payments. 

The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced
by the Partnership will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Partnership s control. These factors include
the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions.
It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Partnership. 

Results of Operations  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the three months ended September 30, 2015: 

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above
table, total oil and gas sales decreased by $73,633, a 19.4% decline, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Of this decline, $56,778 and $31,255 were
due to decreases in the volumes of oil and gas sold, respectively, by 1,387 barrels (bbls) and 11,861 thousand cubic feet (mcf)
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Also contributing to the decline in sales
was $4,958 from a decrease in the average price of oil sold. The average price fell to $40.94 from $42.70 per bbl for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Partially offsetting this decline was $19,358
due to an increase in the average price of gas sold. The average price rose to $2.64 from $2.45 per mcf for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Lease operations. Lease operating expense
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $90,403 from $136,789 for the three month period ended September
30, 2015 due to fewer well repairs and workovers and lower pumping expenses and overhead. 

Production taxes. Production taxes during
the three month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $17,449 from $22,566 for the three month period ended September 30,
2015. This was due to lower overall oil and gas revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Administrative and general expense. Administrative
and general expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 fell to $15,685 from $21,618 for the three month period
ended September 30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $58,573 from $120,893
for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 due to the prior period cost ceiling write-downs that reduced the balance of
the full cost pool subject to amortization and to the overall decrease in oil and gas production. 

Results of Operations  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above
table, total oil and gas sales decreased by $447,703, a 35.5% decline, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Of this decline, $90,234 and $165,863 were
due to decreases in the average prices of oil and gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $36.17 from $46.57 per barrel
(bbl) and to $2.13 from $2.64 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Also contributing to the decline in sales
were $120,134 and $71,472 due to lower volumes of oil and gas sold, respectively, by 3,321 bbls and 33,624 mcf. 

Lease operations. Lease operating expense
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $373,093 from $467,185 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2015 due to fewer well repairs and workovers and lower pumping expenses and overhead. 

Production taxes. Production taxes during
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $44,831 from $74,462 for the nine month period ended September 30,
2015. This was due to lower overall oil and gas revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Administrative and general expense. Administrative
and general expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 fell to $64,803 from $87,046 for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $219,806 from $356,767
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 due to the prior period cost ceiling write-downs that reduced the balance of
the full cost pool subject to amortization and to the overall decrease in oil and gas production. 

Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost
ceiling write-downs totaling $1,108,687 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These were due to lower average oil and gas
prices for the twelve months preceding the write-downs. There were no cost ceiling write-downs for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk 

1.  Interest Rate Risk 

The Partnership Agreement allows borrowings
from banks or other financial sources of up to 20% of the total capital contributions to the Partnership without investor approval.
Should the Partnership elect to borrow monies for additional development activity on Partnership properties, it will be subject
to the interest rate risk inherent in borrowing activities. Changes in interest rates could significantly affect the Partnership s
results of operations and the amount of net cash flow available for partner distributions. Also, to the extent that changes in
interest rates affect general economic conditions, the Partnership will be affected by such changes. 

2.  Commodity Price Risk 

The Partnership does not expect to engage
in commodity futures trading or hedging activities or enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other
speculative purposes.  The Partnership currently expects to sell a significant amount of its production from successful oil
and gas wells on a month-to-month basis at market prices. Accordingly, the Partnership is at risk for the volatility in commodity
prices inherent in the oil and gas industry, and the level of commodity prices will have a significant impact on the Partnership s
results of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a 10% change in the price received for oil and gas production
would have had an approximate $81,000 impact on revenue. 

3.  Exchange Rate Risk 

The Partnership currently has no income
from foreign sources or operations in foreign countries that would subject it to currency exchange rate risk. The Partnership does
not currently expect to purchase any prospects located outside of either the United States or United States coastal waters in the
Gulf of Mexico. 

Item 4.     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

MD maintains a system of controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in this
report, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. MD s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with the assistance
and participation of other members of management. Based upon that evaluation, MD s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the information
the Partnership is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Since MD s December 31, 2015 annual report on internal control over financial
reporting, and for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in MD s internal controls or in other
factors which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal controls over financial reporting. 

Part II   Other Information 

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Registrant may be
a party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these events cannot
be predicted with certainty, the Partnership does not expect these matters to have a material effect on its financial position
or results of operations.
