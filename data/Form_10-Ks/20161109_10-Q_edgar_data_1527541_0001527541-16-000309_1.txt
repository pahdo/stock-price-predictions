1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (the "Trust", the "REIT", or "Company") is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ), which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Trust, through the Operating Partnership, owned and operated   fifty-five   centers,   one   office building,   eight   undeveloped properties, and one redevelopment project in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, New Jersey and West Virginia. Accordingly, the use of the word  Company  refers to the Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires. 
  On October 24, 2014, the Trust, through the Operating Partnership, acquired (i) Wheeler Interests, LLC ( WI ), an acquisition and asset management firm, (ii) Wheeler Real Estate, LLC ( WRE ), a real estate leasing, management and administration firm and (iii) WHLR Management, LLC ( WM  and collectively with WI and WRE the  Operating Companies ), a real estate business operations firm, from Jon S. Wheeler, the Company's Chairman and CEO, resulting in the Company becoming an internally-managed REIT. Accordingly, the responsibility for identifying targeted real estate investments, the handling of the disposition of real estate investments our board of directors chooses to sell, administering our day-to-day business operations, including but not limited to, leasing, property management, payroll and accounting functions, acquisitions, asset management and administration are now handled internally.  
    
  Prior to being acquired by the Company, the Operating Companies served as the external manager for the Company and its properties (the  REIT Properties ) and performed property management and leasing functions for certain related and non-related third parties (the  Non-REIT Properties ). The Company will continue to perform these services for the Non-REIT Properties through the Operating Companies, primarily through WRE. Accordingly, the Company converted WRE to a Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS ) to accommodate serving the Non-REIT Properties since applicable REIT regulations consider the income derived from these services to be  bad  income subject to taxation.  The regulations allow for costs incurred by the Company commensurate with the services performed for the Non-REIT Properties to be allocated to a TRS.  
    
  During January 2014, the Company acquired Wheeler Development, LLC ( WD ) and converted it to a TRS. The Company began performing development activities for both REIT Properties and Non-REIT Properties during 2015.  
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Form 10-Q ) are unaudited and the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for future periods or the year. However, amounts presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   are derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. The Company prepared the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP for interim financial statements. All material balances and transactions between the consolidated entities of the Company have been eliminated. You should read these condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction with our   2015   Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Form 10-K ). 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Investment Properties 
       
  The Company records investment properties and related intangibles at cost or fair value upon acquisition less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Investment properties include both acquired and constructed assets. Improvements and major repairs and maintenance are capitalized when the repair and maintenance substantially extends the useful life, increases capacity or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest on projects during periods of construction until the projects reach the completion point that corresponds with their intended purpose. 
       
  The Company allocates the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the asset based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, the Company may utilize third party valuation specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and any intangible

  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

assets related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place leases the Company determines to exist. The Company determines fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property. Factors considered by management in the analysis of determining the as-if-vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, tenant demand and other economic conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related expenses. Intangibles related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place lease value are recorded as acquired lease intangibles and are amortized as an adjustment to rental revenue or amortization expense, as appropriate, over the remaining terms of the underlying leases. Premiums or discounts on acquired out-of-market debt are amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of such debt.  
       
  The Company records depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally   5   to   40   years. The Company reviews depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and makes adjustments to reflect a shorter economic life, when necessary. Tenant allowances, tenant inducements and tenant improvements are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. 
    
  Amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. The Company amortizes amounts allocated to tenant improvements, in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. The Company also estimates the value of other acquired intangible assets, if any, and amortizes them over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles. 
       
  The Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable, but at least annually. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property s cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. The Company measures any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its residual value, is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the Company charges to income the excess of the carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. The Company may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. The Company did not record any impairment adjustments to its properties during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
       
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of   90   days or less or investments easily converted into known amounts of cash to be cash and cash equivalents without a significant cost to the Company. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank operating accounts and money markets. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include its cash and cash equivalents and its trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with institutions of high credit quality. 
    
  Restricted cash represents amounts held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance, reserves for capital improvements and tenant security deposits. The Company presents changes in cash restricted for real estate taxes, insurance and tenant security deposits as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company presents changes in cash restricted for capital improvements as investing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
       
  The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on deposit with financial institutions in the United States and the amounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company ( FDIC ) up to   $250,000  . The Company's credit loss in the event of failure of these financial institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total amounts on deposit. Management monitors the financial institutions credit worthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk.

Tenant Receivables and Unbilled Rent 
  Tenant receivables include base rents, tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to recording rents on a straight-line basis. The Company determines an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable based upon customer credit-worthiness (including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad debt levels, and current economic trends. The Company considers a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the terms of the lease. The Company s standard lease form considers a rent charge past due after   five   days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other allowable and required actions per the lease. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled   $419,807   and   $411,394  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded bad debt expenses in the amount of   $31,330   and   $196,311  , respectively, related to tenant receivables that were specifically identified as potentially uncollectible based on an assessment of the tenant s credit-worthiness. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded bad debt expenses in the amount of   $112,580   and   $214,316  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did not realize any recoveries related to tenant receivables previously written off. 
    
    Above and Below Market Lease Intangibles, net 
    
    The Company determines the above and below market lease intangibles upon acquiring a property.  Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized over the life of the respective leases.  Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles is recorded as a component of rental revenues. 
       
  Deferred Costs and Other Assets, net 
  The Company s deferred costs and other assets consist primarily of leasing commissions, capitalized legal and marketing costs and tenant relationship intangibles associated with acquisitions. The Company s lease origination costs consist primarily of the portion of property acquisitions allocated to lease originations and commissions paid in connection with lease originations. 
  Details of these deferred costs, net of amortization, and other assets are as follows:

  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Amortization of lease origination costs, leases in place and legal and marketing costs represents a component of depreciation and amortization expense. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s intangible accumulated amortization totaled   $25,722,802   and   $16,595,092  , respectively. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company s intangible amortization expense totaled   $2,996,840   and   $9,555,167  , respectively. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company's intangible amortization expense totaled   $3,403,239   and   $8,121,491  , respectively. Future amortization of lease origination costs, leases in place, legal and marketing costs and tenant relationships is as follows (unaudited):   

  Revenue Recognition 
       
  The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases. The Company accrues minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an unbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on the balance sheet. Additionally, certain of the lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants  sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent). Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized percentage rents of   $57,682   and   $214,225  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized percentage rents of   $27,179   and   $63,326  , respectively. 
       
  The Company s leases generally require the tenant to reimburse the Company for a substantial portion of its expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, insuring and managing the shopping center and common areas (collectively defined as Common Area Maintenance or  CAM  expenses). The Company includes these reimbursements, along with other revenue derived from late fees and seasonal events, under the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations caption "Tenant reimbursements and other revenues." This significantly reduces the Company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation or other outside factors. The Company accrues reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all these expenses as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. The Company calculates the tenant s share of operating costs by multiplying the total amount of the operating costs by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of square feet being leased by the tenant, and the denominator of which is the total square footage of all leasable buildings at the property. The Company also receives escrow payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its tenants throughout the year. The Company recognizes differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year. These differences were not material for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The Company recognizes lease termination fees in the period that the lease is terminated and collection of the fees is reasonably assured. Upon early lease termination, the Company provides for losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized lease termination fees of   $0   and   $25,674  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized lease termination fees of   $0   and   $0  , respectively.

Income Taxes 
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In order to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require the Company to distribute at least   90%   of its taxable income to shareholders and meet certain other asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. Thus, the Company made   no   provision for federal income taxes for the REIT in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it failed to qualify. If the Company loses its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for   five   years unless the Company s failure to qualify was due to a reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied. As the REIT was formed in November 2012, it is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities from the date of formation. 
  Taxable REIT Subsidiary Cost Allocation 
    
  The Company s overall philosophy regarding cost allocation centers around the premise that the Trust exists to acquire, lease and manage properties for the benefit of its investors. Accordingly, a majority of the Company s operations occur at the property level. Each property must carry its own weight by absorbing the costs associated with generating its revenues. Additionally, leases generally allow the Company to pass through to the tenant most of the costs involved in operating the property, including, but not limited to, the direct costs associated with owning and maintaining the property (landscaping, repairs and maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc.), property management and certain administrative costs.  
    
  Service vendors bill the majority of the direct costs of operating the properties directly to the REIT Properties and Non-REIT Properties and each property pays them accordingly. The Non-REIT Properties pay WRE property management and/or asset management fees of   3%   and   2%   of collected revenues, respectively. The Non-REIT Properties also pay WRE leasing commissions based on the total contractual revenues to be generated under the new/renewed lease agreement (  6%   for new leases and   3%   for renewals). Non-REIT properties pay development fees of   5%   of hard costs. 
    
  Compensation and benefits paid to employees of the Company represent the largest component of costs incurred to acquire, manage, lease and administer the properties. The Company believes that every employee position exists to either directly or indirectly perform these functions. Therefore, the Company allocates compensation and benefits to the various functions of the Company based on an estimate of how each employee spends their time. The Company allocates actual costs attributed to property management costs to the TRS on a pro rata basis based on total property revenues generated by the Non-REIT Properties. The Company allocates actual leasing costs to the TRS on a pro rata basis based on total leasing commissions generated by the Non-REIT Properties. Currently, the TRS does not acquire properties for third parties so the Company does not allocate acquisition related costs to the TRS. 
       
  Financial Instruments 
       
  The carrying amount of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities approximates fair market value due to their immediate or short-term maturity. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The Company has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Company s actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  Advertising Costs 
       
  The Company expenses advertising and promotion costs as incurred. The Company incurred advertising and promotion costs of   $23,002   and   $175,887   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company incurred advertising and promotion costs of   $44,376   and   $152,338   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

Assets Held For Sale 
    
  The Company records assets as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets, actively seeks a buyer for the assets, and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year. 
    
  Corporate General and Administrative Expense 
       
  A detail for the "corporate general   administrative" line item from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations is presented below: 

Noncontrolling Interests 
  Noncontrolling interests is the portion of equity in the Operating Partnership not attributable to the Trust. The ownership interests not held by the parent are considered noncontrolling interests. Accordingly, noncontrolling interests have been reported in equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheets but separate from the Company s equity. On the condensed consolidated statements of operations, the subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amount, including both the amount attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interests. Condensed consolidated statement of equity includes beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for shareholders  equity, noncontrolling interests and total equity. 
       
  The noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership common unit holders is calculated by multiplying the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage at the balance sheet date by the Operating Partnership s net assets (total assets less total liabilities). The noncontrolling interest percentage is calculated at any point in time by dividing the number of units not owned by the Company by the total number of units outstanding. The noncontrolling interest ownership percentage will change as additional units are issued or as units are exchanged for the Company s common stock   $0.01   par value per share ( common stock ). In accordance with GAAP, any changes in the value from period to period are charged to additional paid-in capital. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition throughout the ASC. The new standard is principles based and provides a five step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized when a company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard also requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information surrounding the amount, nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU

  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

2016-10,  "Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing," which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and intellectual property licensing implementation. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which relates to assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration and completed contracts and contract modifications in transition. Companies are permitted to adopt the ASUs as early as fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, but the adoption is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. These new standards will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018 and can be applied either retrospectively to all periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)." This ASU defines management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going concern and provides guidance on required financial statement footnote disclosures.  This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016.  The Company will adopt this ASU as of December 31, 2016 and use its guidance when evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
       
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." This new guidance requires the presentation of unamortized debt issuance costs to be shown in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of the principal amount of the associated debt, rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard must be applied using a retrospective approach by restating prior period comparative consolidated balance sheets. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016 and applied it on a retrospective basis for all debt issuance costs, including those pertaining to the Company s revolving credit facility. As a result, unamortized debt issuance costs of   $4.71 million   as of December 31, 2015 have been reclassified from other assets and presented as a deduction of indebtedness in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments." This new guidance requires that the acquirer recognizes adjustments to preliminary acquisition values and account for the cumulative effect of any required adjustments in the period in which they are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard must be applied using a prospective approach for adjustments that occur after the effective date. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." ASU 2016-02 is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as  Lessees  to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases (i.e. operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP. The operating lease will be accounted for in a manner similar to operating leases under existing GAAP, except that lessees will recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all of those leases. The leasing standard will be effective for calendar year-end public companies beginning after December 15, 2018.  Public companies will be required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all companies and organizations upon issuance of the standard. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January 1, 2019 and retrospective application to previously issued annual and interim financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Lessees with a large portfolio of leases are likely to see a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities. See Note 8 for the Company s current lease commitments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements.

  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  The new standard can be applied using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method.  The Company will adopt this ASU in 2017 and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to materially impact its financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).  The ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is to be applied retrospectively for all period presented.  The Company will adopt this ASU in 2018 and does not expect the adoption to materially impact its condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
    Reclassifications 
       
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to make their presentation comparable with the current period. These reclassifications had no impact on net income.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company identified that in previous filings the change in cash restricted for property reserves and payments for deferred financing costs had been reported as cash flows from operating activities and should have been presented as investing and financing activities, respectively. The Company corrected the previously presented cash flows for these items in the current presentation and in doing so, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 has been adjusted to increase net cash flows from operating activities by   $4.3 million   with corresponding decreases in net cash flows from investing and financing activities of   $1.7 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively. The Company has evaluated the effect of the incorrect presentation in prior periods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that it did not have a material impact on, nor require amendment of, any previously filed annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements. 

3. Investment Properties 
  Investment properties consist of the following:   

  The Company s depreciation expense on investment properties was   $1,997,732   and   $5,751,164   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company's depreciation expense on investment properties was   $1,478,698   and   $3,600,673   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  A significant portion of the Company s land, buildings and improvements serves as collateral for its mortgage loans payable portfolio. Accordingly, restrictions exist as to the encumbered property s transferability, use and other common rights typically associated with property ownership.

Acquisitions 
             
  On   April 12, 2016  , the Company completed its acquisition of   14   retail shopping centers located in Georgia and South Carolina (collectively the  A-C Portfolio ) for an aggregate purchase price of   $71 million  , paid through a combination of cash, debt and the issuance of   888,889   common units in the Operating Partnership. Collectively, the A-C Portfolio properties total   605,358   square feet in leaseable space, and were   92%   leased as of the acquisition date by   77   primarily retail tenants.  Each property is anchored by either a Bi-Lo, Harris Teeter or Piggly Wiggly grocery store. 
    
  The A-C Portfolio consists of the following properties: 

The following summarizes the consideration paid and the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions described above, along with a description of the methods used to determine fair value. In determining fair values, the Company considered many factors including, but not limited to, cash flows, market cap rates, location, occupancy rates, appraisals, other acquisitions and management s knowledge of the current acquisition market for similar properties. The valuation and purchase price allocation for this acquisition are preliminary, but are expected to be finalized by March 31, 2017.

a. 
    Represents the preliminary fair value of the net investment properties acquired which includes land, buildings, site improvements and tenant improvements. The preliminary fair value was determined using following approaches: 
     i.     the market approach valuation methodology for land by considering similar transactions in the markets; 
  ii.   a combination of the cost approach and income approach valuation methodologies for buildings, including replacement cost evaluations,  go dark  analyses and residual calculations incorporating the land values; and 
           iii. 
    the cost approach valuation methodology for site and tenant improvements, including replacement costs and prevailing quoted market rates. 
              b. 
    Represents the preliminary fair value of lease intangibles and other assets. Lease intangibles include leasing commissions, in place leases and tenant relationships associated with replacing existing leases. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of these intangible assets which included estimated market rates and expenses. It was determined that carrying value approximated fair value for other asset amounts. 
              c. 
    Represents the fair value of above/below market leases. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of above/below market leases using market rental rates for similar properties.  
              d. 
    Represents the components of purchase consideration paid. 
     Unaudited pro forma financial information in the aggregate is presented below for the acquisitions of the A-C Portfolio. The unaudited pro forma information presented below includes the effects of the acquisition as if it had been consummated as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year. The pro forma results include adjustments for depreciation and amortization associated with acquired tangible and intangible assets, straight-line rent adjustments, interest expense related to debt incurred and adjustments attributable to the increase in noncontrolling interests relating to the incremental common units used as consideration in the acquisition of the A-C Portfolio.

KeyBank Credit Agreement 
    
  On May 29, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into a   $45.0   million revolving credit line (the "Credit Agreement") with KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank"). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, outstanding borrowings accrue monthly interest which is paid at a rate of the one-month London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin ranging from   1.75%   to   2.50%   depending on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.  On April 12, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement ( First Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment increased the   $45.0   million revolving credit line with KeyBank to   $67.2   million and the Company utilized this additional borrowing capacity to acquire the A-C Portfolio. Pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment, the monthly interest of the increased credit facility is adjusted to LIBOR plus a margin of 5.00% until such time that the Company can meet certain repayment and leverage conditions. The Company used Series B proceeds to reduce its borrowings under the Credit Agreement to   $46.1 million   and the margin reduced back to the stated range of the original Credit Agreement on August 15, 2016. The unutilized amounts available to the Company under the Credit Agreement accrue fees which are paid at a rate of    0.30%  . 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has borrowed   $46.1 million   under the Credit Agreement, which is collateralized by the A-C Portfolio acquired on April 12, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding borrowings are accruing interest at   3.01%  . The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants that the Company must meet, including minimum leverage, fixed charge coverage and debt service coverage ratios as well as a minimum tangible net worth requirement. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. The Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default that if they occur may cause KeyBank to terminate the Credit Agreement and declare amounts owed to become immediately payable. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not incurred an event of default. 
  Senior Subordinated Debt 
    
  On January 29, 2016, the Company paid off   $2.16 million   in senior subordinated debt. 
  Revere Loan Agreement 
  In connection with the closing of the A-C Portfolio, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and Revere High Yield Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership ( Revere ), as lender, entered into a Term Loan Agreement dated as of April 8, 2016 ( Revere Term Loan ) in the principal amount of   $8.0 million  . The Revere Term Loan has a maturity date of April 30, 2017 and an interest rate of   8%   per annum. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries serve as guarantors under the Revere Term Loan. The proceeds of the Revere Term Loan were used as partial consideration for the purchase of the A-C Portfolio. A warrant ( Warrant ) to purchase an aggregate of   6,000,000   shares of the Company s common stock (under circumstances described below under the section  Revere Warrant Agreement ) serves as collateral for the Revere Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining outstanding amount under the Revere Term Loan is   $7.45 million  . 
  Revere Warrant Agreement 
  In connection with the Revere Term Loan, the Company and Revere entered into a Warrant Agreement dated as of April 8, 2016 ( Revere Warrant Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue the Warrant to Revere. The terms of the Revere Warrant Agreement provide that solely in the event of an Event of Default (as defined in the Revere Term Loan) under the Revere Term Loan, Revere shall have the right to purchase an aggregate of up to   6,000,000   shares of the Company s common stock for an exercise price equal to   $0.0001   per share. The Warrant is exercisable at any time and from time to time during the period starting on April 8, 2016 and expiring on April 30, 2017 at 11:59 p.m., Virginia Beach, Virginia time, solely in the event of an Event of Default under the Revere Term Loan. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the Warrant; rather the Warrant serves as collateral for the Revere Term Loan, the proceeds of which were used as partial consideration for the A-C Portfolio. The issuance of the Warrant is exempt from registration pursuant to the exemption provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended based upon the above facts, because Revere is an accredited investor and because the issuance of the Warrant was a private transaction by the Company and did not involve any public offering. The Warrant is treated as embedded equity and separate disclosure is not necessary.

7. Rentals under Operating Leases 
    
  Future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable tenant operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter, excluding Common Area Maintenance and percentage rent based on tenant sales volume, as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows:    

8. Equity 
  Earnings per share 
  Basic earnings per share for the Company s common shareholders is calculated by dividing income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding amounts attributable to preferred stockholders and the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, by the Company s weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, excluding amounts attributable to preferred shareholders and the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, by the weighted-average number of common shares including any dilutive shares.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   4,055,292   of the Operating Partnership s common units outstanding to noncontrolling interests are eligible to be converted into shares of common stock, on a one-to-one basis. Additionally,   1,871,244   shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, without par value ("Series B Preferred Stock"), and   1,600,000   shares of Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, without par value ("Series D Preferred Stock"), and    $1,400,000   of senior convertible debt are eligible to be converted into   28,244,214   shares of the Company's common stock and warrants to purchase   2,635,025   shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . In addition,   6,000,000   shares of the Company's common stock may be issued upon exercise of a warrant, solely in the event of a default under a loan agreement in which we serve as a guarantor. The common units, convertible preferred stock, cumulative convertible preferred stock, senior convertible debt and warrants have been excluded from the Company s diluted earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would be antidilutive. 
  Dividends 
  Dividends were declared to holders of common units, common shares and preferred shares as follows: 

On September 19, 2016, the Company declared a   $0.0175   per share dividend payable on or about October 31, 2016 to shareholders and unitholders of record as of   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, the Company has accrued   $1,289,617   as of   September 30, 2016   for this dividend.

Future minimum lease payments due under the operating leases, including applicable automatic extension options, are as follows (unaudited): 

Insurance 
       
  The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio under a blanket insurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage that may be appropriate for certain of its properties. Additionally, the Company carries a directors , officers , entity and employment practices liability insurance policy that covers such claims made against the Company and its directors and officers. The Company believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover its losses. 
    
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
       
  The Company is subject to risks incidental to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate. These risks include, among others, the risks normally associated with changes in the general economic climate, trends in the retail industry, creditworthiness of tenants, competition for tenants and customers, changes in tax laws, interest rates, the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws. 
       
  The Company s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Southwest, which markets represented approximately   2%  ,   20%  ,   75%   and   3%  , respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company s geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company s retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants. 
           
  Regulatory and Environmental 
       
  As the owner of the buildings on our properties, the Company could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in its buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if the Company does not comply with such laws, it could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, the Company could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in its buildings, and the Company could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in its buildings. In addition, some of the Company s tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject the Company or its tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant s ability to make rental payments to the Company, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company s operations. The Company is not aware of any material contingent liabilities, regulatory matters or environmental matters that may exist.

  Executive Overview 
  The   September 30, 2016     three and nine   month periods include the combined operations of all properties owned at   December 31, 2015   as described in our 2015 Form 10-K and approximately two quarters for the fourteen A-C Portfolio properties. Conversely, the   September 30, 2015     three and nine   month periods include the combined operations of all properties owned at   December 31, 2014   as described in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 ("2014 Form 10-K"), and approximately nine months of operations for Pierpont Centre, six months for Alex City Marketplace, a full quarter of operations for Butler Square and Brook Run and a partial quarter of operations for Beaver Ruin Village I and II, Chesapeake Square, Sunshine Plaza, Barnett Portfolio, Grove Park, Parkway Plaza, Fort Howard Square and Conyers Crossing. In providing the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we have separately identified the activities of properties owned for the entire 2015 annual and 2016   three and nine   month periods (collectively referred to as  same stores ) and of those properties acquired after December 31, 2014 (collectively referred to as  new stores ). This illustrates the significant impact these acquired properties acquired during 2015 had on our results of operations. 
  Leasing Activity 
  Renewals during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were comprised of   fifteen   deals totaling   41,374   square feet with a weighted-average increase of   $0.92   per square foot, representing an increase of   7.48%   over prior rates. The rates on negotiated renewals resulted in a weighted-average increase of   $1.21   per square foot on   eleven   renewals and no changes per square foot on four renewals.   Four   renewals represented options being exercised. Additionally, we signed   nineteen   new leases totaling   46,745   square feet with weighted-average rents of   $10.01   per square foot during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Renewals during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were comprised of   forty-one   deals totaling   150,191   square feet with a weighted-average increase of   $0.64   per square foot, representing an increase of   5.58%   over prior rates. The rates on negotiated renewals resulted in a weighted-average increase of   $0.99   per square foot on   thirty-one   renewals and no changes per square foot on ten renewals.   Fifteen   renewals represented options being exercised. Additionally, we signed   thirty-eight   new leases totaling   91,414   square feet with weighted-average rents of   $14.15   per square foot during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  
   27 

Approximately   8.31%   of our gross leasable area is subject to leases that expire during the twelve months ending   September 30,   2017 that have not already been renewed. Based on recent market trends, we believe that these leases will be renewed at amounts and terms comparable to existing lease agreements. 
  Acquisitions 
             
  On   April 12, 2016  , the Company completed its acquisition of   14   retail shopping centers located in Georgia and South Carolina (collectively the  A-C Portfolio ) for an aggregate purchase price of   $71 million  , paid through a combination of cash, debt and the issuance of   888,889   common units in the Operating Partnership. Collectively, the A-C Portfolio total   605,358   square feet in leaseable space, and were   92%   leased as of the acquisition date by   77   primarily retail tenants.  Each property is anchored by either a Bi-Lo, Harris Teeter or Piggly Wiggly grocery store. 
    
  The A-C Portfolio consists of the following properties: 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our   2015   Form 10-K under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  There have been no significant changes to these policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.

  Results of Operations 
  The following table presents a comparison of the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Same Store and New Store Operating Income 
       
  The following table provides same store and new store financial information. The discussion below primarily focuses on same store results of operations since all fourteen of our 2016 retail acquisitions occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . 

30 

Property Revenues 
  Total same store property revenues for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were   $4.89 million   and   $14.53 million  , respectively, compared to   $4.52 million   and   $13.91 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , representing a increase of approximately   $0.36 million   and   $0.62 million  , respectively. Same store revenues fluctuated primarily due to increases in tenant reimbursements and positive rent spreads on renewals. 
  The   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   represent full periods of operations reported for the fifteen retail acquisitions made in   2015  . New stores contributed   $6.10 million   and   $15.98 million  , respectively, in revenues for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.49 million   and   $3.70 million  , respectively, in contributions to revenue for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . Going forward we believe these properties will generate a significant amount of revenue for us and we will benefit from future contractual rent increases and expansion opportunities. 
  Property Expenses 
  Total same store property expenses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1.39 million   and   $4.38 million  , respectively, compared to   $1.35 million   and   $4.38 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . The same store properties operated relatively consistently during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Total property expenses increased primarily due to new store increases of   $0.87 million   and   $2.98 million   for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. 
  There were no significant unusual or non-recurring items included in new store property expenses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Property Net Operating Income 
    
  Total property net operating income was   $7.96 million   and   $22.01 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $4.89 million   and    $12.09 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . The   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   represent an increase of   $3.07 million   and   $9.92 million  , respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. New stores accounted for the majority of these increases by generating   $4.46 million   and   $11.86 million  , respectively, in property net operating income for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.72 million   and   $2.56 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Other Operating Expenses 
  Same store other operating expenses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3.82 million   and   $12.46 million  , respectively, which represent a decreases of   $3.36 million   and   $5.80 million   over the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . These decreases in same store operating expenses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   primarily resulted from decreases of   $0.74 million   and   $1.96 million   in depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, and decreases of   $2.94 million   and   $4.16 million   in general and administrative expenses, respectively. The decreases in same store depreciation and amortization expense for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from additional assets becoming fully depreciated and amortized subsequent to the September 2015 periods. The decreases in same store general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from decreases in acquisition costs and capital related costs. These decreases were offset by increases of $0.35 million and $0.35 million in Non-REIT management and leasing fees due to leasing of Sea Turtle Development for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  Total other operating expenses decreased by   $2.97 million   and   $0.41 million   for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to an overall decrease in in general and administrative expenses as noted above. This decrease was offset by depreciation and amortization resulting from the additional expense associated with the fourteen properties acquired subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization for the nine month period period ended   September 30, 2016   due to new stores. General and administrative expenses during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $0.18 million   and   $1.60 million  , respectively, of non-recurring expenses related to acquisitions, capital events and other miscellaneous costs which are detailed below. 
  
   31 

Acquisition expenses were primarily related to financial statement audits, appraisals and legal matters for the A-C Portfolio acquisition completed on April 12, 2016 and sourcing and due diligence of potential acquisitions currently in our pipeline. Other nonrecurring expenses are miscellaneous costs we believe will not be incurred on a going forward basis. 
  Interest Income 
    
  Same store interest income was $0.30 million and $0.30 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods 
  ended September 30, 2016, which represent increases of $0.27 million and $0.19 million, respectively, as compared to $0.03 million and $0.11 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributed to interest income on the Sea Turtle Development note receivable occurring in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
    Interest Expense 
  Same store interest expense was   $2.70 million   and   $7.10 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , which represent increases of   $0.95 million   and   $1.57 million  , respectively, as compared to   $1.74 million   and   $5.53 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . Same store interest expensed is primarily attributable to incremental debt service associated with additional borrowings. Total interest expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $1.31 million     and   $3.35 million  , respectively. The increase is primarily attributed to the incremental debt service associated with the additional borrowings utilized to acquire the fourteen retail properties occurring subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . 
  Funds from Operations 
  We use Funds from Operations ("FFO"), a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002). As defined by NAREIT, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan origination costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results.

Below is a comparison of same and new store FFO for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

During the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , same store FFO increased   $2.66 million   and   $3.08 million  , respectively, primarily due to decreases of   $2.94 million   and   $4.16 million  , respectively, in corporate general and administrative expenses, increases in property net operating income of $0.32 million and $0.62 million, respectively, and partially offset by increases in interest expense of $0.95 million and $1.57 million, respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , as described above. Total FFO increased   $5.53 million   and   $10.79 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the expansion of operations resulting from the twenty-nine retail acquisitions occurring subsequent to December 31, 2014 that contributed incremental new store FFO of $2.87 million and $7.71 million when compared to the same period prior year. 
  We believe the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash amortization on loans and acquisition costs.  Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO ("AFFO"), which we define to exclude such items.  Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets.  In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO.  However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs. 
  
   33 

Total AFFO for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, is shown in the table below:    

  Preferred stock dividends for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015   include approximately $0.0 million and $1.98 million, respectively, of dividends (excluding the impact of accretion adjustments) related to the Series C Preferred Stock. The preferred stock accretion adjustments represent the amortization of offering costs associated with raising the Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock. Other non-recurring expenses primarily relate to those costs that are related to miscellaneous items that we do not anticipate incurring on a going forward basis. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled   $35.82 million   compared to consolidated cash and cash equivalents of   $10.48 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:   

  Operating Activities 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash flows from operating activities were   $11.00 million  , compared to cash flows used in operating activities of   $2.44 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating cash flows were primarily impacted by the   $8.47 million   decrease in our consolidated net loss due to the factors discussed in the Results of Operations section above, specifically the additional FFO of   $7.71 million   from new stores that were acquired in 2015 and 2016. Also impacting operating cash flows is the fluctuation in acquisition deposits included within deferred costs and the timing of the respective acquisitions. 
  Investing Activities 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash flows used in investing activities were   $21.34 million  , compared to cash flows used in investing activities of   $63.10 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect amounts used for the A-C portfolio acquisition consisting of fourteen retail property acquisitions as well as increased capital expenditures of $1.32 million for existing properties. We acquired $71 million of assets in 2016 compared to $141 million in 2015. The A-C portfolio acquisition was accomplished utilizing an 85% loan to value ratio versus a typical ratio of 55% to 65% required on most CMBS loans. This resulted in less cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash paid capital property reserves decreased by $1.1 million due to prior year reserved balances being released upon completion of required  
  
   34 

activities. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were $11.0 million in cash outflows for the issuance of the Sea Turtle Development notes receivable. Investing cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   are offset by the impact of approximately $0.9 million related to the acquisition of the Ruby Tuesday and Outback Steakhouse ground leases at Pierpont Centre, which are now assets held for sale. 
  Financing Activities 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash flows from financing activities were   $35.68 million  , compared to   $63.48 million   of cash flows from financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The primary factor contributing to the comparative fluctuation in financing cash flows was the Series C Preferred Stock offering in March 2015, which generated $83.42 million as compared to Series B Preferred Stock proceeds of $23.4 million and Series D Preferred Stock proceeds of $38.0 million in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, there was an increase in dividends paid of $2.57 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period last year. Payments for deferred financing costs increased for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   due to higher debt related to incremental new debt of $60.3 million compared to $75.6 million for same period last year. This is offset by an increase in 2016 loan proceeds of $20.10 million, which included the refinancing of Chesapeake Square and Perimeter Square. There was an increase in loan principal payments of $22.3 million related to the pay down of the KeyBank line of credit and the refinancing of Chesapeake Square and Perimeter Square which is offset by the payoff of the Lumber River loan in 2015. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our debt balances, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, consisted of the following:   

The weighted-average interest rate and term of our fixed-rate debt are   4.95%   and   7.03   years, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . We have   $16.4 million   of debt maturing during the twelve months ending   September 30,     2017  . While we anticipate being able to refinance our maturing loans at reasonable market terms upon maturity, our inability to do so may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. See the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional mortgage indebtedness details. 
  Future Liquidity Needs 
    
  In addition to the funding of our ongoing operations, the primary liquidity needs of the Company at September 30, 2016 are $16.4 million in debt maturities due within the following year, debt service payments, preferred stock dividends (approximately $7.9 million), margin covenant requirements as detailed in our Credit Agreement with KeyBank and the $0.21 per share (approximately $15.5 million) targeted annual common stock dividend we are currently paying on a monthly basis. At September 30, 2016 the Revere Term Loan had a balance of $7.45 million and any payoff of this amount would trigger a payment of the incremental unpaid portion of the $640 thousand contractually guaranteed interest due through April 30, 2017 plus a $240 thousand exit fee. The loan is payable April 30, 2017; however with a principal payment of $450 thousand and an exit fee of $240 thousand, the loan can be extended until April 30, 2018. The entire principal balance of $7.45 million is included in the $16.4 million of debt maturities due prior to September 30, 2017 described above. Based on our proven ability to refinance debt and obtain alternative sources of capital, and existing market conditions, we believe it to be probable that our plans to meet these obligations will be successful. 
    
  In the 3rd quarter 2016, the Company raised $23.4 million and $38 million in net proceeds from the Series B Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock offerings, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock was primarily used for the paydown of the Key Bank Credit Agreement to $46.1million in the third quarter of 2016. The Series D Preferred Stock proceeds will primarily be used for future acquisitions and working capital. 
    
  Our success in refinancing the debt and executing on our growth strategy will dictate our liquidity needs going forward. If we are unable to execute in these areas, our ability to grow and pay future dividends may be limited without additional capital. 

35 

In addition to liquidity required to fund debt payments, distributions and acquisitions, we may incur some level of capital expenditures during the year for our existing properties that cannot be passed on to our tenants. The majority of these expenditures occur subsequent to acquiring a new property that requires significant improvements to maximize occupancy and lease rates, with an existing property that needs a facelift to improve its marketability or when tenant improvements are required to make a space fit a particular tenant s needs. Significant capital expenditures could also impact our ability to grow and pay future dividends. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition throughout the ASC. The new standard is principles based and provides a five step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized when a company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard also requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information surrounding the amount, nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU  2016-10,  "Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing," which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and intellectual property licensing implementation. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which relates to assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration and completed contracts and contract modifications in transition. Companies are permitted to adopt the ASUs as early as fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, but the adoption is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. These new standards will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018 and can be applied either retrospectively to all periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)." This ASU defines management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going concern and provides guidance on required financial statement footnote disclosures.  This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016.  The Company will adopt this ASU as of December 31, 2016 and use its guidance when evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
       
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." This new guidance requires the presentation of unamortized debt issuance costs to be shown in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of the principal amount of the associated debt, rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard must be applied using a retrospective approach by restating prior period comparative consolidated balance sheets. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016 and applied it on a retrospective basis for all debt issuance costs, including those pertaining to the Company s revolving credit facility. As a result, unamortized debt issuance costs of   $4.71 million   as of December 31, 2015 have been reclassified from other assets and presented as a deduction of indebtedness in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments." This new guidance requires that the acquirer recognizes adjustments to preliminary acquisition values and account for the cumulative effect of any required adjustments in the period in which they are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard must be applied using a prospective approach for adjustments that occur after the effective date. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." ASU 2016-02 is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate,  
  
   36 

airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as  Lessees  to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases (i.e. operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP. The operating lease will be accounted for in a manner similar to operating leases under existing GAAP, except that lessees will recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all of those leases. The leasing standard will be effective for calendar year-end public companies beginning after December 15, 2018.  Public companies will be required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all companies and organizations upon issuance of the standard. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January 1, 2019 and retrospective application to previously issued annual and interim financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Lessees with a large portfolio of leases are likely to see a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities. See Note 8 for the Company s current lease commitments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  The new standard can be applied using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method.  The Company will adopt this ASU in 2017 and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to materially impact its financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).  The ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is to be applied retrospectively for all period presented.  The Company will adopt this ASU in 2018 and does not expect the adoption to materially impact its condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate exposure is LIBOR. We primarily use fixed interest rate financing to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $159.25 million  , or   66.38%  , of our debt had fixed interest rates and approximately   $80.65 million  , or   33.62%  , had variable interest rates. Assuming no increase in the level of our variable rate debt, if interest rates increased by 1.0%, our cash flow would decrease by approximately   $0.81 million   per year. At   September 30, 2016  , LIBOR was approximately 53 basis points. Assuming no increase in the level of our variable rate debt, if LIBOR was reduced to zero basis points, our cash flow would increase by approximately   $0.42 million   per year. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The management of the Trust, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Trust s management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents   

disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   (the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q).  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. 
    
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or liquidity. 
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
  The Company first met the requirements of an accelerated filer in 2015, therefore, it was not required to disclose risk factors in any of its previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K.  Accordingly, this item is not applicable   The Company did disclose risk factors in its Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the  Registration Statement ) filed on August 24, 2016, as amended (File No. 333-213294) and there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the Registration Statement.
