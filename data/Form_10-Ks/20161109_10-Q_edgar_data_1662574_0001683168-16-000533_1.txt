CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION   

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
 forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements are based upon our current assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential
effect on our business. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words:  may,   will, 
 could,   would,   should,   expect,   intend,   plan, 
 anticipate,   believe,   approximately,   estimate,   predict,   project, 
 potential,   continue,   ongoing,  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology,
although the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. This information may involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. 

Factors that may cause or contribute actual results to differ
from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, for example: 

adverse economic conditions;   

the inability to attract and retain qualified senior management and technical personnel;   

other risks and uncertainties related to the LED lighting market and our business strategy.   

All forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other information contained
herein. Stockholders and potential investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although we believe
that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report are reasonable,
we cannot assure stockholders and potential investors that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. We disclose
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations under  Risk Factors  in
our registration statement and amendments thereto on Form S-1. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. 

These forward-looking statements represent
our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described
in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Except to the extent required by law, we
undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events,
a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.

  Notes to Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited)  

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Illumination America, Inc., a
Florida corporation (the  Company ), formerly Illumination America, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, was formed on
October 6, 2009. The limited liability company was converted into a corporation on August 14, 2014. The Company s
accounting year end is December 31. 

Management s Representation of Interim Financial
Statements   

   The accompanying unaudited
financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) have been condensed or
omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations, and management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the
information presented not misleading. These financial statements include all of the adjustments, which in the opinion of
management are necessary to a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of
a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements at December 31, 2015 as presented in the
Company s registration statement on Form S-1/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN   

The Company s financial statements
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have been prepared using US GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established
an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company
has incurred significant losses. 

In order to continue as a going concern,
the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for
the Company by obtaining capital from its directors and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses
and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful
in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation  

The condensed financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting
and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses or recognized when incurred. 

Stock Split  

On December 22, 2015, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized a forward split of the Company s issued and outstanding Common Stock whereby each share of
Common Stock was exchanged for 1.2847603145 shares, with fractional shares rounded to the nearest round number. In connection therewith,
Company shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 22, 2015 the record date, received an additional 1.2847603145
shares of the Company s Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held by them on the record date. Under the guidelines
of Staff Accounting Bulletin 4c, a capital structure change such as a stock split that occurs after the date of the most recent
balance sheet must be given retroactive effect in the balance sheet. Accordingly, all references to the numbers of Common Shares
and per share data in the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this forward split on a retroactive basis,
unless indicated otherwise. 

Use of Estimates  

In preparing financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include
estimated useful lives and potential impairment of property and equipment, estimate of fair value of share based payments and derivative
instruments and recorded debt discount, valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation of in-kind contribution of services and
interest. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid
temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company cash equivalents totaled $28 and $107,673 respectively. 

Accounts Receivable  

The Company records accounts receivable
at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss
anticipated on the accounts receivable balances and is charged to Other income (expense) in the statements of operations. We calculate
this allowance based on our history of write-offs, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables,
and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our customers. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an allowance
for estimated uncollectible accounts was determined to be unnecessary. 

Net Loss per Share   

Net loss per Common Share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average Common Shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards,
ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) calculations are determined
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per
Common Share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of Common Shares and dilutive Common
Share equivalents outstanding. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue when the
four revenue recognition criteria are met, as follows: 

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists    our customary practice is to obtain written evidence, typically in the form of a sales contract or purchase order;   

Delivery    when custody is transferred to our customers either upon shipment to or receipt at our customers  locations, with no right of return or further obligations, such as installation;   

The price is fixed or determinable    prices are typically fixed at the time the order is placed and no price protections or variables are offered; and   

Collectability is reasonably assured    we typically work with businesses with which we have a long standing relationship, as well as monitoring and evaluating customers  ability to pay.   

Refunds and returns, which are minimal,
are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Payments received by customers prior to our satisfying the above criteria are recorded
as unearned income in the consolidated balance sheets. To date, substantially all of the Company s revenue has come from
the sale of LED tubes and fixtures. If the Company enters into a project requiring installation, this installation is performed
by the client or from a third party contractor and no revenue is recognized on the installation since the third party directly
bills the client. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company applies the accounting guidance
under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements , as well as certain
related FASB staff positions. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair
value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. 

The guidance also establishes a fair value
hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows: 

Level 1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2 - inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   

The carrying amount of the Company's financial
instruments approximates their fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

NOTE 4   PURCHASE OF INTANGIBLE

Members of the Company s Board of
Directors have advanced working capital to pay expenses of the Company. These loans payable are due on demand and non-interest
bearing. The outstanding amounts due to related parties was $128,828 and $34,751 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,

Item 2.  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and because we desire to take
advantage of, the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers
regarding certain forward looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report and in any other statement
made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward looking statements
are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other
developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with
respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on our behalf.
We disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements.  

Overview  

We were originally formed in the State
of Florida on October 6, 2009 as a limited liability company. On April 24, 2014, we reorganized as a Florida corporation. Since
inception we have been engaged in the design, development, marketing and sales of energy-efficient lighting systems and solutions.
We have intended to create and develop a reliable source of revenue from our activities in order to create the opportunity to market
proprietary products that can be utilized both in a commercially beneficial manner, as well as on a custom basis. 

We have never been subject to any bankruptcy
proceeding. Our executive offices are located at 2060 NW Boca Raton Blvd, Suite 6, Boca Raton, FL 33431, telephone (561) 997-7270 .
 Our website address is www.illuminationamerica.com. 

Results
of Operations    

Comparison of Results of Operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues    

In order to expand our sales efforts, on
May 5, 2016, we purchased certain intangible assets including the tradename  Catalyst LED  ( Catalyst ),
its client list, its website domain, list of leads, current pending orders, current bid proposals, and all future orders made under
the Catalyst name, as well as its other unregistered trademarks, and goodwill. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement we agreed
to pay ForceField Energy Inc., a Nevada corporation, the owner of the assets, $50,000, which was payable in three equal monthly
increments of $16,666.67, commencing on May 15, 2016. As of the date of this Report, we have had made partial payments totaling
$25,000 and currently owe $25,000 to ForceField. We intend to make these payments as soon as cash becomes available to do so. 

During the three month period ended September
30, 2016, we generated revenues of $66,822, compared to revenues of $90,693 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015
a decrease of $23,871. The decrease is attributable to fewer LED projects won and installed in three month period ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Based upon current projects we are bidding on and projects with existing clients
we expect to exceed our third quarter 2016 revenue levels during the fourth quarter of this year ending on December 31, 2016, although
there can be no assurances we will do so. 

Our LED business is based upon bidding
and winning new LED contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so, or that we can secure large individual
projects in excess of $100,000-$300,000 as we did during the second quarter of 2016. Once an LED project is completed there is
very little, if any, opportunity to generate additional revenue from that contract. Due to the nature of our business, we believe
that our quarterly and annual revenues and gross margins will continue to fluctuate and are not indicative of sustainable revenue
and margin levels we expect to achieve. Therefore, until we achieve higher sustainable revenue levels, individual LED projects
could have a material impact on revenue comparisons from period to period. LED projects we typically undertake vary in size and
complexity. For example, the number of LED bulbs and fixtures required for an office building may vary from the amount required
for a small retail outlet. 

Gross margin    

Gross margin is calculated by subtracting
cost of sales from revenue. Gross margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross margins by revenue. Our gross margin has been
and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including product mix and fluctuations in the cost of purchased products
and components and our ability to properly estimate the costs of projects. 

Gross margin for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 was $11,724, or 17.5% of revenue, as compared to gross margin of $24,611, or 27.1% of revenue,
during the three month ended September 2015. The decrease in gross margins was attributable to our product mix which varies
from project to project. Until we achieve levels of revenue that are consistent from period to period, our gross margin will
be subject to significant fluctuation because amount of mark-up we can take on our products varies from job to job, the size
of the project and are impacted by factors such as market competition, type of fixtures to be installed and the lighting
budgets of each client. 

Operating expenses    

Operating expenses during the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, were $182,007, compared to operating expenses of 504,805 incurred during the three month period
ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $137,990. The principal reason for this decrease is due to $350,000 in non-cash stock based
compensation expense incurred in 2015 compared to zero in 2016. Other operating expenses increased
$27,202 during the three month ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. This increase is attributable to additional
payroll, professional fees associated with our now being a public reporting company, and executive compensation, offset by a reduction
in general and administrative expenses ( G A  expenses). The reduction in G A expenses is primarily attributable
to $56,667 in consulting fees incurred in the three month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to zero during the same three
month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Net loss    

As a result, we generated a net loss
of $170,283 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, or ($0.02) per share, compared to a net loss of $473,792 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015, or ($0.05) per share.  

Comparison of Results of Operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues    

During the nine month period ended September
30, 2016, we generated revenues of $578,680, compared to revenues of $178,399 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $400,281. The material increase in revenue is directly attributable to the hiring of a full time salesman during
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, who was able to secure and complete three large sales of LED products under the
Catalyst name, with one sale totaling approximately $343,000 which represented a tenfold increase above our largest historical sale. 

Gross margin    

Gross margin is calculated by subtracting
cost of sales from revenue. Gross margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross margins by revenue. Our gross margin has been
and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including product mix and fluctuations in the cost of purchased products
and components and our ability to properly estimate the costs of projects. 

Gross margin for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $105,320, or 18.2% of revenue, as compared to gross margin of $44,835, or 25.1% of revenue, during
the nine month ended September 2016. The decrease in gross margins was attributable to our larger projects in 2016 which carry
a significantly lower margin than small projects. Until we achieve levels of revenue that our consistent from period to period,
our gross margin will be subject to significant fluctuation because amount of mark-up we can take on our products varies from job
to job, the size of the project and are impacted by factors such as market competition, type of fixtures to be installed and the
lighting budgets of each client. 

Operating Expenses    

Operating expenses during the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016, were $555,596, compared to operating expenses of $662,547 incurred during the
nine month period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $106,551. The principal reason for this decrease was attributable
to stock based compensation of $350,000 incurred in the relevant period in 2015. We did not incur any such expense during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was offset by an increase in professional fees from $42,790 in 2015, to
$205,323 due to costs associated with our becoming a full reporting public company. The remaining increase in operating
expenses in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is attributable to increase
in executive compensation of approximately $68,500, an increase in payroll expenses of approximately $90,000 related to
the hiring of a new full time salesperson, offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses of approximately
$80,000. The reduction in G A expenses is primarily attributable to $56,667 in consulting fees incurred in the three
month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to zero during the same nine month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Net loss    

As a result of the above, we generated
a net loss of $421,629 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or ($0.04) per share, compared to a net loss of $599,063
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, or ($0.07) per share. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016, we had $28
in cash. 

Net cash used in operating activities was
$198,478 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $308,218 during the comparable period in 2015. The
decrease in the cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to net changes in operating
assets and liabilities of $282,306 compared to the same period in 2015, offset to a lesser extent by an increase in net loss (net
of non-cash compensation expense) of $172,566 in the relevant period in 2016. 

Cash flows used in investing activities
were $16,667 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $-0- during the same period in 2015 due to our purchase
in 2016 of $50,000 for the Catalyst intangible assets, $33,333 of which was due to the Seller on September 30, 2016. 

Cash flows provided by financing activities
were $107,500 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $315,000 during the same period ended in 2015 due
to the proceeds received from the issuance of our Common Stock. 

Since our inception substantially all of
our funding has been obtained from private placements of our Common Stock and from loans from related parties. During the year
ending December 31, 2015, we accepted subscription agreements from investors and issued 790,128 shares of our Common Stock for
net proceeds totaling $615,000. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, we have issued 137,280 shares of our Common
Stock for net proceeds of $107,500. 

On October 13, 2016 we accepted subscriptions
from one investor and issued 64,103 shares of our Common Stock for net proceeds totaling $50,000. 

In December 2015, we undertook a forward
split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock whereby each share of Common Stock was exchanged for 1.2847603145 shares, with
fractional shares rounded to the nearest round number. All references in this Report to our outstanding Common Shares is presented
on a post forward split basis, unless indicated otherwise. 

We believe that our principal difficulty
in our ability to successfully generate profits has been the lack of available capital to operate and expand our business. We believe
we need a minimum of approximately $500,000 in additional working capital to be utilized for beta testing of our website,
intellectual property filings, product development, marketing and working capital. As of the date of this Report we have no commitment
from any investor or investment-banking firm to provide us with the necessary funding and there can be no assurances we will obtain
such funding in the future. Failure to obtain this additional financing will have a material negative impact on our ability to
remain as a going concern and to begin to generate profits on a regular basis in the future. 

Inflation   

Although our operations are influenced
by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Critical Accounting Estimates   

Our condensed financial statements and
accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually
evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements. The estimates are
based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts
and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management
estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our Registration Statement
on Form S-1 in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Market Risk

effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was
