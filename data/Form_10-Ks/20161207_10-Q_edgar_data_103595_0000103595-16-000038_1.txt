VILLAGE SUPER MARKET, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (In thousands) (Unaudited) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION and ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position as of   October 29, 2016   and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the   13   week periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015   of Village Super Market, Inc. ( Village  or the  Company ). 
    
  The significant accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in the   July 30, 2016   Village Super Market, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with these financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended   October 29, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

2. MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES 
    
  At both   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , approximately   64%   of merchandise inventories are valued by the LIFO method while the balance is valued by FIFO.  If the FIFO method had been used for the entire inventory, inventories would have been   $14,522   higher than reported at both   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  . 

3. NET INCOME PER SHARE 
    
  The Company has   two   classes of common stock. Class A common stock is entitled to cash dividends as declared   54%   greater than those paid on Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis for Class A common stock at any time. 
    
  The Company utilizes the two-class method of computing and presenting net income per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income per share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, Class A common stock is assumed to receive a   54%   greater participation in undistributed earnings than Class B common stock, in accordance with the classes' respective dividend rights. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and therefore included in computing net income per share using the two-class method. 
    
  Diluted net income per share for Class A common stock is calculated utilizing the if-converted method, which assumes the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis, as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. Diluted net income per share for Class B common stock does not assume conversion of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock. 

7 

The tables below reconcile the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted net income per share for all periods presented. 

Outstanding stock options to purchase Class A shares of   5   and   394   were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share at   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively, as a result of their anti-dilutive effect. In addition,   250   and   269   non-vested restricted Class A shares, which are considered participating securities, and their allocated net income were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculation at   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effect. 

8 

4. PENSION PLANS 
    
  The Company sponsors   four   defined benefit pension plans.  Net periodic pension cost for the four plans includes the following components: 

On February 15, 2016, the Company amended the Village Super Market Employees Retirement Plan, which covers nonunion employees and pharmacists, to freeze all benefits effective March 31, 2016.  As a result of this amendment, the Company recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain totaling $  17,904   in accumulated other comprehensive loss during fiscal 2016.  
    
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company has not made contributions to its pension plans in fiscal   2017  .  The Company expects to contribute approximately   $3,000   during fiscal   2017   to fund its pension plans. 

5. RELATED PARTY INFORMATION - WAKEFERN 
    
  A description of the Company s transactions with Wakefern, its principal supplier, and with other related parties is included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 30, 2016  .  There have been no significant changes in the Company s relationships or nature of transactions with related parties during the first   13   weeks of fiscal   2017   except for an additional required investment in Wakefern common stock of   $626  . 
    
  Included in cash and cash equivalents at   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   are   $42,000   and   $63,609  , respectively, of demand deposits invested at Wakefern at overnight money market rates. 

6. COMMITMENTS and CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Company is involved in other litigation incidental to the normal course of business. Company management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (Dollars in Thousands) 

OVERVIEW 
    
  Village Super Market, Inc. (the  Company  or  Village ) operates a chain of 29 ShopRite supermarkets in New Jersey, Maryland and northeastern Pennsylvania.  Village is the second largest member of Wakefern Food Corporation ( Wakefern ), the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite name. As further described in the Company s Form 10-K, this ownership interest in Wakefern provides Village many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with larger chains.  
    
  The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins.  The Company competes directly with multiple retail formats, both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Village competes by using low pricing, superior customer service, and a broad range of consistently available quality products (including ShopRite private labeled products). The ShopRite Price Plus card also strengthens customer loyalty. 
    
  The Company s stores, six of which are owned, average 59,000 total square feet. These larger store sizes enable the Company s stores to provide a  one-stop  shopping experience and to feature expanded higher margin specialty departments such as an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen, a variety of natural and organic foods, ethnic and international foods, prepared foods and pharmacies.   
    
  Many of our stores emphasize a Power Alley, which features high margin, fresh, convenience offerings in an area within the store that provides quick customer entry and exit for those customers shopping for today's lunch or dinner.  Certain of our stores include the Village Food Garden concept featuring a restaurant style kitchen, and several kiosks offering a wide variety of store prepared specialty foods for both take-home and in-store dining.   
    
  Village also has on-site registered dieticians in fifteen stores that provide customers with free, private consultations on healthy meals and proper nutrition, as well as leading health related events both in store and in the community as part of the Live Right with ShopRite program.  We have   thirteen   stores that offer ShopRite from Home covering most of the communities served by our stores.  ShopRite from Home is an online ordering system that provides for in-store pickup or home delivery.  Customers can browse our circular, create and edit shopping lists and use ShopRite from Home through shoprite.com or on their smart phones or tablets through the ShopRite app.  
    
  We consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance, such as same store sales; percentage of total sales by department (mix); shrink; departmental gross profit percentage; sales per labor hour; units per labor hour; and hourly labor rates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following table sets forth the major components of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of sales: 

Sales  .  Sales were   $389,692   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   $389,529   in the   first   quarter of the prior year.  Same store sales were flat.  Same store sales increased due to the closing of four competitor stores and continued sales growth in the expanded or replaced stores in Stirling and Greater Morristown.  These increases were offset by reduced sales due to seven new competitor store openings, including stores formerly operated by A P, and deflation in the meat and dairy departments.  The Company expects same store sales in fiscal   2017   to range from a   0.5%   decrease to a   1.5%   increase.  New stores and replacement stores are included in same store sales in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters.  Store renovations and expansions are included in same store sales immediately.   
    
  Gross Profit  .  Gross profit as a percentage of sales   decreased     .23%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the   first   quarter of the prior year primarily due to   decreased   departmental gross margin percentages (  .13%  ) and increased promotional spending (.08%).  
    
    Operating and Administrative Expense  .  Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales   decreased     .06%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the   first   quarter of the prior year due primarily to decreased non-union pension expense (  .34%  ) partially offset by higher payroll  (  .27%  ).   Payroll costs increased due to investments in service departments at the newly remodeled Chester store and reduced operating leverage on flat same store sales.   
    
  Depreciation and Amortization  .  Depreciation and amortization expense   increased   slightly in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year due to depreciation related to fixed asset additions. 
    
  Interest Expense  .  Interest expense in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   was flat compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. 
    
  Interest Income  .  Interest income   increased   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the corresponding period of the prior year due to higher amounts invested in demand deposits at Wakefern.  
    
  Income Taxes.    The effective income tax rate was   41.5%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   41.9%   in the   first   quarter of the prior year.  The effective income tax rate decreased slightly due to an increase in estimated work opportunity tax credits.  
    
  Net Income  .  Net income was   $4,109   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   $4,430   in the   first   quarter of the prior year. Net income decreased 7% in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the prior year due primarily to flat same store sales and a lower gross profit percentage partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

11 

Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations.  These policies require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The Company s critical accounting policies relating to the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, accounting for patronage dividends earned as a stockholder of Wakefern,  accounting for pension plans, and accounting for uncertain tax positions, are described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 30, 2016  .  As of   October 29, 2016  , there have been no changes to any of the critical accounting policies contained therein. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $12,317   in the   13  -week period of fiscal   2017   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $5,415   in the corresponding period of the prior year.  Net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital and net income adjusted for non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred taxes and the provision to value inventories at LIFO.  Working capital changes increased cash used in operating activities in fiscal   2017   by   $23,260   and decreased net cash provided by operating activities by   $4,796   in fiscal   2016  .   The larger impact of working capital changes in fiscal   2017   is due primarily to changes in income taxes receivable/payable due to the timing of estimated tax payments.   
    
  During the   13  -week period of fiscal   2017  , Village used cash to fund capital expenditures of   $6,795  , dividends of   $3,162   and invested an additional   $459   in notes receivable from Wakefern.  Capital expenditures primarily include costs associated with one major remodel and several smaller remodels of other existing stores.  In October 2015, Village sold the land and building of a closed store in Washington, New Jersey for $900. 
    
  Village has budgeted approximately   $25,000   for capital expenditures in fiscal   2017  .  Planned expenditures include the beginning of construction of a new store in the Bronx, New York, one major remodel, several smaller remodels and certain energy efficient lighting projects.  The Company s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal   2017   are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at   October 29, 2016   and operating cash flow generated in fiscal   2017  . 
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , the Company had   $43,194   in notes receivable due from Wakefern. Of these notes,   $21,463   earn interest at the prime rate plus .25% and mature on August 15, 2017 and   $21,731   earn interest at the prime rate plus 1.25% and mature on February 15, 2019. Wakefern has the right to prepay these notes at any time. Under certain conditions, the Company can require Wakefern to prepay the notes, although interest earned since inception would be reduced as if it was earned based on overnight money market rates as paid by Wakefern on demand deposits.  
    
  Working capital was   $81,917   at   October 29, 2016   compared to   $60,538   at   July 30, 2016  . Working capital ratios at the same dates were   1.91   and   1.61   to 1, respectively.  The increase in working capital in fiscal   2017   compared to fiscal   2016   is due primarily to   $21,463   in notes receivable from Wakefern that have been reclassified to current assets as they are due on August 15, 2017. The Company s working capital needs are reduced, since inventories are generally sold by the time payments to Wakefern and other suppliers are due. 
    
  Village has an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing a maximum amount available for borrowing of   $25,000  . This loan agreement expires on   December 31, 2018  . The revolving credit line can be used for general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under this agreement bears interest at the prime rate, or at the Eurodollar rate, at the Company s option, plus applicable margins based on the Company s fixed charge coverage ratio. There were   no   amounts outstanding at   October 29, 2016   or   July 30, 2016   under this facility. 
    
  There have been no substantial changes as of   October 29, 2016   to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 30, 2016  .  
  
   12 

OUTLOOK 
    
  This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements about Village s future performance. These statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available.  Such statements relate to, for example:  same store sales; economic conditions; expected pension plan contributions; projected capital expenditures; cash flow requirements; inflation expectations; and legal matters; and are indicated by words such as  will,   expect,    should,   intend,   anticipates,   believes  and similar words or phrases.  The Company cautions the reader that there is no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from the results expressed, suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof. 
    
     We expect same store sales to range from a   0.5%   decrease to an increase of   1.5%   in fiscal   2017  . 
             
    We have budgeted   $25,000   for capital expenditures in fiscal   2017  .  Planned expenditures include the beginning of construction of a new store in the Bronx, New York, one major remodel, several smaller remodels and certain energy efficient lighting projects. 
                
    The Board s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends in   2017   at the most recent rate of $.25 per Class A and $.1625 per Class B share. 
                
    We believe cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and debt payments for the foreseeable future. 
                 
    We expect operating expenses will be affected by increased costs in certain areas, such as medical and other fringe benefit costs. 
                
    We expect approximately   $600   of net periodic pension costs in fiscal   2017   related to the four Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans. The Company expects to contribute   $3,000   in cash to all defined benefit pension plans in fiscal   2017  . 
     Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. These include: 

The supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. Results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs, industry consolidation and competitor store openings. Village competes with national and regional supermarkets, local supermarkets, warehouse club stores, supercenters, drug stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, discount merchandisers, restaurants and other local retailers. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do. 
                
    The Company s stores are concentrated in New Jersey, with one store in northeastern Pennsylvania and two in Maryland. We are vulnerable to economic downturns in New Jersey in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole. External factors such as inflation, deflation, interest rate fluctuations, movements in energy costs, social programs, minimum wage legislation, unemployment rates and changing demographics may adversely affect our sales and profits.   
                
    Village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. In addition, Wakefern provides the Company with support services in numerous areas including supplies, advertising, liability and property insurance, technology support and other store services. Further, Village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from Wakefern. Any material change in Wakefern s method of operation or a termination or material modification of Village s relationship with Wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company s business and could involve additional expense for Village. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to Wakefern or a member s insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to the Company. Additionally, an adverse change in Wakefern s results of operations could have an adverse effect on Village s results of operations. 
                
    Approximately   92%   of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results. If we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs. 
     
   13 

Village could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 
                
    Certain of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, withdrawals by other participating employers and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors. 
                
    Our long-lived assets, primarily store property, equipment and fixtures, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure of our asset groups to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets. 
                
    Our effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws. 
                
    Wakefern provides all members of the cooperative with information system support that enables us to effectively manage our business data, customer transactions, ordering, communications and other business processes.  These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and related malicious software, catastrophic weather events, or human error.  Any material interruption of our or Wakefern s information systems could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
     Due to the nature of our business, personal information about our customers, vendors and associates is received and stored in these information systems. In addition, confidential information is transmitted through our ShopRite from Home online business at shoprite.com and through the ShopRite app. Unauthorized parties may attempt to access information stored in or to sabotage or disrupt these systems. Wakefern and the Company maintain substantial security measures to prevent and detect unauthorized access to such information, including utilizing third-party service providers for monitoring our networks, security reviews, and other functions. It is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may be able to defeat the security measures in place at the Company, Wakefern or those of third-party service providers. 
  Any breach of these security measures and loss of confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, could damage our reputation with customers, vendors and associates, cause Wakefern and Village to incur significant costs to protect any customers, vendors and associates whose personal data was compromised, cause us to make changes to our information systems and could result in government enforcement actions and litigation against Wakefern and/or Village from outside parties. Any such breach could have a material adverse impact on our operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity if the related costs to Wakefern and Village are not covered or are in excess of carried insurance policies. In addition, a security breach could require Wakefern and Village to devote significant management resources to address problems created by the security breach and restore our reputation.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU No. 2014-09 on its financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases." This guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and a right-of-use asset for all leases with terms of more than 12 months on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with earlier adoption permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after the date of initial adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." The guidance changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including accounting for income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , the Company had demand deposits of   $42,000   at Wakefern earning interest at overnight money market rates, which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. 
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , the Company had   $43,194   in notes receivable due from Wakefern. Of these notes,   $21,463   earn interest at the prime rate plus .25% and mature on August 15, 2017 and   $21,731   earn interest at the prime rate plus 1.25% and mature on February 15, 2019. Wakefern has the right to prepay these notes at any time. Under certain conditions, the Company can require Wakefern to prepay the notes, although interest earned since inception would be reduced as if it was earned based on overnight money market rates as paid by Wakefern on demand deposits.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision, and with the participation, of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer along with the Company s Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, along with the Company s Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   October 29, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

VILLAGE SUPER MARKET, INC. 
  REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE   FIRST   QUARTER ENDED 
  OCTOBER 29, 2016    

Springfield, New Jersey       December 7, 2016     Village Super Market, Inc. (NSD-VLGEA) today reported its results of operations for the   first   quarter ended   October 29, 2016  .  
    
  Net income was   $4,109,000   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   $4,430,000   in the   first   quarter of the prior year.     Net income decreased 7% in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to the prior year due primarily to flat same store sales and a lower gross profit percentage partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses.  
    
  Sales were   $389,692,000   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   $389,529,000   in the   first   quarter of the prior year. Same store sales were flat.  Same store sales increased due to the closing of four competitor stores and continued sales growth in the expanded or replaced stores in Stirling and Greater Morristown.  These increases were offset by reduced sales due to seven new competitor store openings, including stores formerly operated by A P, and deflation in the meat and dairy departments. The Company expects same store sales in fiscal   2017   to range from a 0.5% decrease to a   1.5%   increase.  
    
  Gross profit as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   26.85%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   27.08%   in the   first   quarter of the prior year. 
    
  Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   23.39%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared to   23.45%   in the   first   quarter of the prior year due primarily to decreased non-union pension expense partially offset by higher payroll.   Payroll costs increased due to investments in service departments and reduced operating leverage on flat same store sales.   
    
  Village Super Market operates a chain of 29 supermarkets under the ShopRite name in New Jersey, Maryland and northeastern Pennsylvania.
