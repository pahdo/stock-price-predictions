    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)   
  As of September 30, 2016      (dollar amounts in thousands,
except per share data)      1. ORGANIZATION   
 NF Investment Corp. ( NFIC  or the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation formed on November 1, 2012, and structured as an
externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. NFIC has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ). NFIC has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).    NFIC s investment objective is to generate current income and
capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S. middle market companies, which the Company defines as companies with approximately $10 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
( EBITDA ). NFIC seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans; first lien/last out loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority
behind first lien/first out loans;  unitranche  loans, which are loans that combine features of first lien, second lien or subordinated loans, generally in a first lien position; and secured corporate bonds with features similar to the
features of these categories of first lien loans) and second lien senior secured loans (which may include senior secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first lien loans) (collectively,
 Middle Market Senior Loans ), subject to, in the case of second lien senior secured loans, a limit of 10% of NFIC s total assets. The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in
many cases, controlled by private equity firms. In addition, NFIC may invest up to 10% of its total assets in high yield securities whose risk profile, as determined at the sole discretion of Carlyle GMS Investment Management L.L.C. (the
 Investment Adviser ), is similar to or better than the risk profile of Middle Market Senior Loans. NFIC expects that the composition of its portfolio will change over time given the Investment Adviser s view on, among other things,
the economic and credit environment (including with respect to interest rates) in which the Company is operating.    On August 6, 2013,
NFIC completed its initial closing of capital commitments (the  Initial Closing ) and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations.  
 NFIC is an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. NFIC expects to remain an
emerging growth company because it does not intend to pursue an initial public offering.    NFIC SPV LLC (the  Borrower Sub ) is a
Delaware limited liability company that was formed on June 18, 2013. The Borrower Sub invests in first and second lien senior secured loans. The Borrower Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is consolidated in these consolidated
financial statements commencing from the date of its formation, June 18, 2013.    NFIC is externally managed by the Investment Adviser,
an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Carlyle GMS Finance Administration L.L.C. (the  Administrator ) provides the administrative services necessary for NFIC to operate. Both the Investment
Adviser and the Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group L.P.  Carlyle  refers to The Carlyle Group L.P., its affiliates and its consolidated subsidiaries, a
global alternative asset manager publicly traded on NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  CG . Refer to the sec.gov website for further information on Carlyle.

  Upon the earlier of August 6, 2018 and the completion of an initial public offering by Carlyle
GMS Finance, Inc. ( Carlyle GMS Finance ) (the other BDC managed by the Investment Adviser) that results in an unaffiliated public float of at least 15% of its aggregate capital commitments (a  Qualified IPO ), the Board of
Directors (subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will use its best efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company. These efforts may include cash tender offers from
time to time as proceeds become available. Refer to sec.gov website for further information on Carlyle GMS Finance.    As a BDC, NFIC is
required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As part of these requirements, the Company must not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the Investment Company Act unless, at the time the acquisition is
made, at least 70% of its total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions).    NFIC has elected to be treated, and
intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code, and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, NFIC must, among other things, meet certain
source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders generally at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, NFIC generally does
not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that it distributes to stockholders, provided that NFIC satisfies those requirements.    2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of Presentation    
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ). The Company is an investment company for the purposes of accounting and financial reporting in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-08, Financial
Services Investment Companies ( ASU 2013-08 ):  Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NFIC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Borrower
Sub. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. US GAAP for an investment company requires investments to be recorded at fair value. The carrying value for all other assets and liabilities approximates their
fair value.    The interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information and
pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 and 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP are omitted. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of consolidated financial statements for the interim period presented have been included. These adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. This Form 10-Q
should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results to be expected for the full year.      Use of Estimates    
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management s
estimates are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying
the Company s  
      18  

Table of Contents  

accounting policies. Assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of investments and their resulting impact on management fees involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and these
assumptions and estimates may be significant to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material.  
   Investments      Investment
transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without
regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. See Note 3 for further
information about fair value measurements.      Cash and Cash Equivalents    
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments (e.g., money market funds, U.S. treasury notes) with
original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The Company s cash and cash equivalents are held with two large financial institutions and cash held in such financial
institutions may, at times, exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit.      Revenue Recognition    
  Interest from Investments and Realized Gain/Loss on Investments   
 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and
premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt investments represents the original cost,
including origination fees, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. At time of exit, the realized gain or loss on an investment is the difference between the amortized cost at time of exit and the cash received
at exit using the specific identification method.    The Company may have loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind
( PIK ) provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no loans in the portfolio contained PIK provisions.  
  Other Income     Other income may include
income such as consent, waiver, amendment, and syndication fees associated with the Company s investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized
as income when earned or the services are rendered. The Company may receive fees for guaranteeing the outstanding debt of a portfolio company. Such fees will be amortized into other income over the life of the guarantee. The unamortized amount, if
any, is included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.     Non-Accrual Income   
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable
doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid  
      19  

Table of Contents  

interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon
management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may not place a
loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no
loans in the portfolio were on non-accrual status.      Revolving Credit Facility and Facility Related Costs, Expenses and Deferred Financing Costs (See
Note 5, Borrowings)      Interest expense and unused commitment fees on the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility are recorded on an
accrual basis. Unused commitment fees are included in credit facility fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.    The
Revolving Credit Facility and Facility are recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value.    Deferred financing costs include
capitalized expenses related to the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility. Amortization of deferred financing costs for each credit facility is computed on the straight-line basis over the respective term of each credit facility,
except for a portion that was accelerated in connection with the amendment of the Revolving Credit Facility as described in Note 5. The amortization of such costs is included in credit facility fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations.      Organization and Offering Costs    
 The Company agreed to reimburse the Investment Adviser for initial organization and offering costs incurred on behalf of NFIC up to $750. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $663 of organization and offering costs had been incurred by NFIC since inception. The $663 of incurred organization and offering costs are allocated to all stockholders based on their respective
capital commitment and are re-allocated amongst all stockholders at the time of each capital drawdown subsequent to the Initial Closing. The Company s organization costs incurred are expensed and the offering costs are charged against equity
when incurred.      Income Taxes    
 For federal income tax purposes, NFIC has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required distributions to its
stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, NFIC must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then NFIC is generally required to pay income taxes
only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute.    The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs
require NFIC to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income ( ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, NFIC may choose to carry forward ICTI in
excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such
ICTI.    In addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, NFIC is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on
undistributed income unless NFIC distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the
one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by NFIC that is subject to
corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. NFIC intends to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the excise distribution requirements.  
      20  

Table of Contents  

  The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its
consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely than not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income
tax expense.    The Borrower Sub is a disregarded entity for tax purposes and is consolidated with the tax return of NFIC.  
   Capital Calls and Dividends and Distributions to Common Stockholders    
 The Company records the shares issued in connection with capital calls as of the effective date of the capital call. To the extent that the
Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its common stockholders. Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date and paid in cash. The amount to be distributed
is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually, although the Company
may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.      Functional Currency    
 The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar and all transactions were in U.S. Dollars.  
   Recent Accounting Standards Updates    
 On April 7, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-3,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-3 ). ASU 2015-3 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums. This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and the ASU requires the guidance to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted the new
accounting guidance and it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In August 2015, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Sub-topic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU
2015-15 ). ASU 2015-03 does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. In accordance with ASU 2015-15, an entity may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and
subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. This guidance was effective for the Company
on January 1, 2016. The Company adopted the new accounting guidance and it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS     The Company
applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the
amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by
multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded
in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e.,  consensus pricing ). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained
is sufficient  
      21  

Table of Contents  

according to US GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques
typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.    Securities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not
provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or NFIC s Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all
techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or
discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such
portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a
preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board
of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded investment is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a
rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management s preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Audit Committee ) reviews the assessments of the
Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the
valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.  
 All factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the
following factors, as relevant:      

the nature and realizable value of any collateral;        

call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;        

the portfolio company s leverage and ability to make payments;        

the portfolio company s public or private credit rating;        

the portfolio company s actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;        

prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;        

the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and        

comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.      Investment performance
data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.  
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value
of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the
investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.  
      22  

Table of Contents  

  In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of
the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.    US GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used
in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and
transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and
a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.    Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and
disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in determination of fair values, as follows:      

Level I inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in Level I generally include
unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact
the quoted price.        

Level II inputs to the valuation methodology are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date and are those other than quoted prices in active markets. The type of financial instruments in this
category generally includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on
observable inputs.        

Level III inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or
estimation. Financial instruments that are in this category generally include investments in privately-held entities, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
     In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such
cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Investment Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.    Transfers between levels,
if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers between levels.  
 The following tables summarize the Company s investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the above fair value hierarchy
levels as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The changes in the Company s investments at fair value for which the Company has used Level III inputs to
determine fair value and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) included in earnings for Level III investments still held are as follows:      

24  

Table of Contents  

The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments that are
categorized as Level III:    Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the
portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded
comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Company carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These
factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow
analysis of the portfolio company.    Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value
analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis.    Investments in debt securities with
sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s
contractual interest, fees and principal payments plus the  
      25  

Table of Contents  

assumption of full principal recovery at the security s expected maturity date. The discount rate to be used is determined using an average of two market-based methodologies. Investments in
debt securities may also be valued using consensus pricing.    The following tables summarize the quantitative information related to the
significant unobservable inputs for Level III instruments which are carried at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
     
   The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in
first and second lien debt securities are discount rates and indicative quotes. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in indicative quotes in isolation may result
in a significantly lower fair value measurement.

    Financial instruments disclosed but not carried at fair value    
 The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of the Company s secured borrowings disclosed but not carried at fair value
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   The carrying values of the secured borrowings approximate their respective fair values and are categorized as
Level III within the hierarchy. Secured borrowings are valued generally using discounted cash flow analysis. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s secured borrowings are discount rates.
Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.    The carrying value of other
financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value based on the short term nature of these items.     4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   
   Investment Advisory Agreement      On
July 10, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not  interested persons  as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (the  Independent Directors ),
approved an investment advisory agreement (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ) between the Company and the Investment Adviser in accordance with, and on the basis of an evaluation satisfactory to such directors as required by,
Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act. The initial term of the Investment Advisory Agreement is two years from July 10, 2013 and, unless terminated earlier, the Investment Advisory Agreement will renew automatically for successive
annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board of Directors and by the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors. On March 10, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors,
including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the Advisory Agreement for a one year period. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either
party without penalty upon at least 60 days  written notice to the other party. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these
services, the Investment Adviser receives management fees from the Company.    The management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in
arrears at an annual rate of 0.25% of the average value of the gross assets of the Company at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters, excluding any cash and cash equivalents and including assets acquired with leverage from use of
the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility (see Note 5, Borrowings). For purposes of this calculation, cash and cash equivalents include any temporary investments in cash-equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality investment
grade debt investments that mature in 12 months or less from the date of investment. The management fee for any partial quarter is prorated.  
 For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, management fees were $179 and $496, respectively. For the three month and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, management fees were $144 and $396, respectively.    As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, $179 and $151, respectively, was included in management fees payable in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Table of Contents  

  On July 10, 2013, the Investment Adviser entered into a personnel agreement with The Carlyle
Group Employee Co., L.L.C. ( Carlyle Employee Co. ), an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which Carlyle Employee Co. provides the Investment Adviser with access to investment professionals.  
   Administration Agreement      On
July 10, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors approved an administration agreement (the  Administration Agreement ) between the Company and the Administrator. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides
services and receives reimbursements equal to an amount that reimburses the Administrator for its costs and expenses and the Company s allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the
Administration Agreement, including the Company s allocable portion of the compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by the Company s officers (including the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and
respective staff who provide services to the Company, operations staff who provide services to the Company, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in the Company s Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control
assessment. Reimbursement under the Administration Agreement occurs quarterly in arrears.    The initial term of the Administration
Agreement is two years from July 10, 2013 and, unless terminated earlier, the Administration Agreement will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the
vote of the Board of Directors or by a majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company s Independent Directors. On March 10, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors, including
a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the Administration Agreement for a one year period. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other party and may be terminated by
either party without penalty upon at least 60 days  written notice to the other party.    For the three month and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016, NFIC incurred $45 and $143, respectively, and for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, NFIC incurred $45 and $139, respectively, in fees under the Administrative Agreement, which were
included in administrative service fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $30 and $35, respectively, was unpaid and included in administrative service fees payable in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.      Sub-Administration Agreements    
 On July 10, 2013, the Administrator entered into sub-administration agreements with Carlyle Employee Co. and CELF Advisors LLP. Pursuant
to the agreements, Carlyle Employee Co. and CELF Advisors LLP provide the Administrator with access to personnel.    On July 10, 2013,
the Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (as amended, the  Sub-Administration Agreement ). On March 11, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors, including a majority of the
Independent Directors, approved an amendment to the Sub-Administration Agreement. The initial term of the Sub-Administration Agreement ends on April 1, 2017 and, unless terminated earlier, the Sub-Administration Agreement will renew automatically

 In accordance with the Investment Company Act, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the
Investment Company Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, asset coverage was 223.79% and 211.27%, respectively. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there were secured
borrowings of $31,850 under the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility and repayments of $22,423 under the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, there were secured borrowings of $85,700 under

outstanding.      Revolving Credit Facility    
 The Borrower Sub closed on September 12, 2013 on the Revolving Credit Facility, which was subsequently amended on July 25, 2014 and
further amended on November 13, 2015 (the  Second Amendment ). Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility first became available once the Borrower Sub held at least $10,500 of minimum equity in its assets. The Revolving Credit Facility
provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to an amount equal to the lesser of $120,000 (the borrowing base as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility) and the amount of net cash proceeds and
unpledged capital commitments the Company has received, with an accordion feature that can, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate maximum credit commitment up to an amount not to exceed $262,500, subject to restrictions imposed on
borrowings under the Investment Company Act and certain restrictions and conditions set  
      29  

Table of Contents  

forth in the Revolving Credit Facility, including adequate collateral to support such borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility has a revolving period through the earlier of May 2, 2018 and the
completion of a Qualified IPO by Carlyle GMS Finance (with two one-year extension options, subject to the Borrower Sub s and the lenders  consent) and a maturity date of the earlier of May 2, 2021 or the completion of a Qualified IPO by
Carlyle GMS Finance (extendable in connection with an extension of the revolving period). Base rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest initially at the applicable commercial paper rate (if the lender is a conduit lender) or
LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate) plus 1.65% per year during the revolving period, with pre-determined future interest rate increases of 1.25%-2.15% over the three years following the end of the
revolving period. The Borrower Sub is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of between 0.25% and 1.00% per year depending on the usage of the Revolving Credit Facility. Payments under the Revolving Credit Facility are made quarterly.
The lenders have a first lien security interest on substantially all of the assets of the Borrower Sub.   As part of the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Borrower Sub is subject to limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used and the types of loans that are eligible to be acquired by the Borrower Sub including, but not limited to, restrictions on sector and geographic
concentrations, loan size, payment frequency, tenor and minimum investment ratings (or estimated ratings). In addition, borrowed funds are intended to be used primarily to purchase first lien loan assets, and the Borrower Sub is limited in its
ability to purchase certain other assets (including, but not limited to, second lien loans, covenant-lite loans, revolving and delayed draw loans and discount loans) and other assets are not permitted to be purchased (including, but not limited to
paid-in-kind loans). The Revolving Credit Facility has certain requirements relating to interest coverage, collateral quality and portfolio performance, including limitations on delinquencies and charge offs, certain violations of which could result
in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is also subject to a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to assets held by the Borrower Sub based generally on the
fair market value of such assets. Under certain circumstances as set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company could be obliged to repurchase loans from the Borrower Sub. 
 Related to the Second Amendment, which reduced the maximum commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, $167 of deferred financing costs
(representing the prorated financing costs related to the reduction in commitments) were immediately expensed on November 13, 2015 in lieu of continuing to amortize over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Borrower Sub was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements of the
Revolving Credit Facility.      Facility    
 The Company closed on March 27, 2014 on the Facility, which was subsequently amended on August 22, 2014, December 12, 2014 and further amended
on August 31, 2016. The maximum principal amount of the Facility is $50,000, subject to availability under the Facility, which is based on certain advance rates multiplied by the value of the Company s portfolio investments net of certain other
indebtedness that the Company may incur in accordance with the terms of the Facility. Proceeds of the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. Maximum capacity under the Facility may be
increased to $125,000 through the exercise by the Company of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing. The Facility includes a $10,000 limit for swingline
loans and a $5,000 limit for letters of credit. The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including certain collateral quality tests. The availability period under the Facility will terminate
on May 2, 2018 or earlier under certain conditions specified in the Facility (the  Commitment Termination Date ) and the Facility will mature on March 27, 2020 (the  Maturity Date ). During the period from the Commitment
Termination Date to the Maturity Date, the Company will be obligated to make mandatory prepayments under the Facility out of the proceeds of certain asset sales, other recovery events and equity and debt issuances. Amounts drawn under the Facility,
including amounts drawn in respect of letters of  
      30

credit, will bear interest at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable spread of (i) prior to the Commitment Termination Date, 2.25% and (ii) following the Commitment Termination Date, 2.50%, or (b)
an  alternative base rate  (which is the highest of a prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an applicable spread of (i) prior to the Commitment Termination Date, 1.00% and (ii)
following the Commitment Termination Date, 1.50%. The Company may elect either the LIBOR or the  alternative base rate  at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain
conditions. The Company also pays a fee of 0.50% on undrawn amounts under the Facility and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then-applicable margin under the Facility while the letter of credit is
outstanding.    Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the
portfolio investments held by the Company and the Company s unfunded investor equity capital commitments (provided that the amount of unfunded capital commitments ultimately available to the lenders is limited to $34,000). The pledge of
unfunded investor equity capital commitments was subject to release upon the earlier of (a) the date eligible investments held by the Company are equal to or greater than $62,500 and the Facility s borrowing base equity test is satisfied and
(b) the date the borrower has received equity capital contributions in an amount equal to $34,000. Such eligible investments and shareholder equity thresholds have been satisfied as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Facility includes
customary covenants, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage, shareholders  equity, liquidity and interest coverage, certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, and other maintenance
covenants, as well as usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this nature.    As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements of the Facility.      Summary of
Facilities      The facilities of the Company and the Borrower Sub consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:

ended September 30, 2015, the weighted average interest rate was 1.94% and 1.94%, respectively, and average principal debt outstanding was $108,546 and $98,052, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the interest rate was
2.40% and 2.04%, respectively, based on floating LIBOR rates.    For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and

    6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
 A summary of significant contractual payment obligations was as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
   
   In the ordinary course of its business, the Company enters into contracts or agreements that contain
indemnification and warranties. Future events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Company. The Company believes that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No
accrual has been made in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for any such exposure.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $190,077 in total capital commitments from stockholders, of which $28,540
and $53,540, respectively, was unfunded. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, current directors had no capital commitments to the Company.  
 Upon the earlier of August 6, 2018 and the completion of a Qualified IPO by Carlyle GMS Finance, investors will be released from any
further obligation under their capital commitments to purchase additional shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions contained in their investment subscription agreements.

  The Company had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior
secured loans as of the indicated dates:      
    7. NET ASSETS   
 The Company has the authority to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 per share par value.  
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 1,292,072 shares for $25,000. The following table summarizes capital
activity during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016:      
   During the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 1,795,023 shares for $35,582. The

  The following table summarizes total shares issued and proceeds received related to capital
subscriptions for the Company s common stock during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016:      
   The following table summarizes total shares issued and proceeds received related to capital subscriptions for
the Company s common stock during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015:      
   Subscribed but unissued shares are presented in equity with a deduction of subscriptions receivable until cash
is received for a subscription. There were no subscribed but unissued shares as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
 Subscription transactions during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were executed at an offering price at a premium to
net asset value due to the requirement to use prior quarter net asset value as offering price unless it would result in the Company selling shares of its common stock at a price below the current net asset value and also in order to effect a
reallocation of organizational costs to subsequent investors. Such subscription transactions increased net asset value by $0.02 per share and $0.06 per share, respectively, for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, four stockholders represented 97.3% of total net assets.  
 The Company computes earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share.  Basic earnings per common share were
calculated by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  
 Basic and diluted earnings per common share were as follows:

  The following table summarizes the Company s dividends declared and payable since inception
through September 30, 2016:      
    8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   
 The following is a schedule of consolidated financial highlights for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

(1) 
 Net investment income (loss) per share was calculated as net investment income (loss) for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.    

(2) 
 Dividends declared per share was calculated as the sum of dividends declared during the period divided by the number of shares outstanding at each respective quarter-end date (refer to Note 7).    
      35  

Table of Contents  

(3) 
 Increase is due to offering price of subscriptions during the period (refer to Note 7).    

(4) 
 Total return (not annualized) is based on the change in net asset value per share during the period plus the declared dividends, divided by the beginning net asset value for the period. Total return for the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is inclusive of $0.02 and $0.06, respectively, per share increase in net asset value for the periods related to the offering price of subscriptions. Excluding the effects of the higher offering price of
subscriptions, total return (not annualized) would have been 7.88% and 7.08%, respectively (refer to Note 7).    

(5) 
 These ratios to average net assets have not been annualized.       9. LITIGATION   
 The Company may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of current
matters, if any, will materially impact the Company or its consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to the Company s knowledge,
is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company.    In addition, portfolio investments of the Company could be the subject
of litigation or regulatory investigations in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any current contingent liabilities of its portfolio investments, if any, will materially affect the Company or these
consolidated financial statements.     10. TAX   
 The Company has not recorded a liability for any uncertain tax positions pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and
certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had filed tax returns and therefore is subject to examination.  
 The Company s taxable income for each period is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return for
each year. Therefore, the final taxable income, and the taxable income earned in each period and carried forward for distribution in the following period, may be different than this estimate. The estimated tax character of dividends declared for the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:      
    11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   
 Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. There have been no subsequent events
that require recognition or disclosure through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, except as disclosed below.  
 Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $3,000 under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund investment acquisitions. The Company
also voluntarily repaid $8,493 under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 NF Investment Corp. ( we ,  us ,  our ,  NFIC  or the  Company ) is a Maryland
corporation formed on November 1, 2012, and structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. NFIC has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ). NFIC has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a
regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the  Code ).  
 NFIC s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S. middle
market companies, which we define as companies with approximately $10 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). NFIC seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing
primarily in first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans; first lien/last out loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind first lien/first out loans;  unitranche  loans, which are loans
that combine features of first lien, second lien or subordinated loans, generally in a first lien position; and secured corporate bonds with features similar to the features of these categories of first lien loans) and second lien senior secured
loans (which may include senior secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first lien loans) (collectively,  Middle Market Senior Loans ), subject to, in the case of second lien senior
secured loans, a limit of 10% of NFIC s total assets. The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms. In addition, NFIC may invest up to 10%
of its total assets in high yield securities whose risk profile, as determined at the sole discretion of Carlyle GMS Investment Management L.L.C. (the  Investment Adviser ), is similar to or better than the risk profile of Middle Market
Senior Loans. We expect that the composition of our portfolio will change over time given our Investment Adviser s view on, among other things, the economic and credit environment (including with respect to interest rates) in which we are
operating.    NFIC is externally managed by the Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, as amended. Carlyle GMS Finance Administration L.L.C. (the  Administrator ) provides the administrative services necessary for NFIC to operate. Both the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group L.P.  Carlyle  refers to The Carlyle Group L.P., its affiliates and its consolidated subsidiaries, a global alternative asset manager publicly traded on NASDAQ Global
Select Market under the symbol  CG . Refer to the sec.gov website for further information on Carlyle.    Upon the earlier of
August 6, 2018 and the completion of an initial public offering by Carlyle GMS Finance, Inc. ( Carlyle GMS Finance ) (the other BDC managed by the Investment Adviser) that results in an unaffiliated public float of at least 15% of its
aggregate capital commitments (a  Qualified IPO ), the Board of Directors (subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act)

will use its best efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company. These efforts may include cash tender offers from time to time as proceeds become available. Refer to sec.gov
website for further information on Carlyle GMS Finance.      Investments    
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt
available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make.      Revenue
     We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments we hold and capital gains, if any, on
investments. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid
quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The
frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment,
structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.      Expenses    
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) management fees to our Investment Adviser pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ) between us and our Investment Adviser; (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations
under an administration agreement (the  Administration Agreement ) between us and our Administrator; and (iii) other operating expenses as detailed below:      

our initial organization costs and offering costs incurred prior to the filing of our election to be regulated as a BDC (the amount in excess of $750 to be paid by our Investment Adviser);    

the costs associated with the Private Offering;        

the costs of any other offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any;        

calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);        

expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Investment Adviser, or members of the Investment Adviser team managing our investments, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio
companies and, if necessary, expenses of enforcing our rights;        

management fees payable under our Investment Advisory Agreement;        

certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;

 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile
of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as  Internal Risk Ratings :  
   Internal Risk Ratings Definitions        

Rating   
    
    Definition    

1 
    
  Performing Low Risk:  Borrower is operating more than 10% ahead of the Base Case.  

2 
    
  Performing Stable Risk:  Borrower is operating within 10% of the Base Case (above or below). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers.  

3 
    
  Performing Management Notice:  Borrower is operating more than 10% below the Base Case. A financial covenant default may have occurred, but there is a low risk of payment default.  

4 
    
  Watch List:  Borrower is operating more than 20% below the Base Case and there is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is
moderate to high risk of payment default.  

5 
    
  Watch List Possible Loss:  Borrower is operating more than 30% below the Base Case. At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or
refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have occurred. Loss of principal is possible.  

6 
    
  Watch List Probable Loss:  Borrower is operating more than 40% below the Base Case, and at the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay
or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Additionally, the prospects for improvement in the borrower s situation are sufficiently negative that impairment of some or all
principal is probable.  
   Our Investment Adviser s risk rating model is based on evaluating portfolio company performance in
comparison to the Base Case when considering certain credit metrics including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA and net senior leverage as well as specific events including, but not limited to, default and impairment.  
 Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. In
connection with our quarterly valuation process, our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings on a regular basis. The following table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Table of Contents  

  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our
debt investment portfolio was 2.2 and 2.1 respectively.     CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
 The net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors,
including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons may not be meaningful.  
  Investment Income     Interest income for
the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
   The increase in interest income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 from the
comparable periods in 2015 was driven by our deployment of capital and increasing invested balance. As of September 30, 2016, the size of our portfolio increased to $294,146 from $233,928 as of September 30, 2015, at amortized cost, and total
principal amount of investments outstanding increased to $297,270 from $236,499 as of September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average yield of our first and second lien debt increased to 6.76% from 6.51% as of September 30, 2015,
on amortized cost.    Interest income on our first and second lien debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of
the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, all of our first and second lien debt investments
were performing and current on their interest payments.    Net investment income for the three month and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

   Expenses       
   Interest expense and credit facility fees for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were comprised of the following:      
   The increase in interest expense for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 from the
comparable periods in 2015 was driven by increased usage of the Company s credit facilities and increased deployment of capital to investments. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest
rate under the facilities was 2.32% and 2.26%, respectively, and average principal debt outstanding was $124,446 and $117,732, respectively. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the weighted average interest rate was
1.94% and 1.94%, respectively, and average principal debt outstanding was $108,546 and $98,052, respectively.    The increase in management
fees for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable periods in 2015 was driven by our deployment of capital and increasing invested balance. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information on the management fees.    Professional fees include legal, rating agencies,
audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred
by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include
insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs.     Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on
Investments     During the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a change in unrealized
appreciation on 14 and 77 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $2,986 and $4,798,  
      44  

Table of Contents  

respectively, which was offset by a change in unrealized depreciation on 2 and 23 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $1,465 and $3,883, respectively. During the three month and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a change in unrealized appreciation on 30 and 51 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $932 and $2,185, respectively, which was offset by a change in unrealized depreciation on
43 and 29 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $955 and $1,143, respectively.      
   Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) by the type of investments
for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
     
   Net change in unrealized depreciation in our investments for the three month and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable periods in 2015 was primarily due to changes in various inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, market spreads, leverage multiples and borrower ratings.  
  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and
repayments as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Borrower Sub s senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the  Revolving Credit
Facility ) and/or the Company s senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the,  Facility ).  
      45  

Table of Contents  

  The Borrower Sub closed on September 12, 2013 on the Revolving Credit Facility, which was
subsequently amended on July 25, 2014 and November 13, 2015. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to an amount equal to the lesser of $120,000 (the borrowing base as calculated
pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility) and the amount of net cash proceeds and unpledged capital commitments the Company has received, with an accordion feature that can, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate maximum
credit commitment up to an amount not to exceed $262,500, subject to restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act and certain restrictions and conditions set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility, including adequate
collateral to support such borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility imposes financial and operating covenants on us and the Borrower Sub that restrict our and its business activities. Continued compliance with these covenants will depend on many
factors, some of which are beyond our control.    The Company closed on March 27, 2014 on the Facility, which was subsequently amended
on August 22, 2014, December 12, 2014 and further amended on August 31, 2016. The maximum principal amount of the Facility is $50,000, subject to availability under the Facility, which is based on certain advance rates multiplied by the value
of the Company s portfolio investments net of certain other indebtedness that the Company may incur in accordance with the terms of the Facility. Proceeds of the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of
portfolio investments. Maximum capacity under the Facility may be increased to $125,000 through the exercise by the Company of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional
financing. The Facility includes a $10,000 limit for swingline loans and a $5,000 limit for letters of credit. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments
held by the Company and the Company s unfunded investor equity capital commitments (provided that the amount of unfunded capital commitments ultimately available to the lenders is limited to $34,000). The pledge of unfunded investor equity
capital commitments was subject to release upon the earlier of (a) the date eligible investments held by the Company are equal to or greater than $62,500 and the Facility s borrowing base equity test is satisfied and (b) the date the
borrower has received equity capital contributions in an amount equal to $34,000. Such eligible investments and shareholder equity thresholds had been satisfied as of September 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Facility includes customary
covenants, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage, shareholders  equity, liquidity and interest coverage, certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, and other maintenance covenants, as
well as usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this nature.    Although we believe that we
and the Borrower Sub will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we or the Borrower Sub will continue to comply with the covenants in the Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could
result in a default under the Facility and/or Revolving Credit Facility that, if we or the Borrower Sub were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the Facility
and/or Revolving Credit Facility, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 For more information on the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1
of this Form 10-Q.    The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio
companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes.

respectively, of secured borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $39,500 and $31,000, respectively, were outstanding under the Facility. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $56
and $185, respectively, of unused commitment fees and $742 and $2,033, respectively, of interest expense. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $539 and $1,446, respectively, of interest expense and $99 and
$334, respectively, of unused commitment fees.     OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
 In the ordinary course of its business, the Company enters into contracts or agreements that contain indemnification and warranties. Future
events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Company. The Company believes that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in these
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for any such exposure.  
 We have in the past and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing
commitments, or delayed draw commitments.    The Company had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior
secured loans as of the indicated dates:

 Annualized dividend yield is calculated by dividing the declared dividend by the weighted average of the net asset value at the beginning of the quarter and the capital called during the quarter and annualizing over 4
quarterly periods.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those
relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in Part II, Item 8
of the Company s annual report on  Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Fair Value
Measurements      The Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC
Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The
Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain
quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e.,
 consensus pricing ). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to US GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources
may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.    Securities/instruments that are
illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued
as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent
 
      49  

Table of Contents  

transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment
is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs,
updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a
valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans portfolio each quarter (such that each
non-traded investment is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management s preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors (the  Audit Committee ) reviews the assessments of the Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each
investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment
Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.    All factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are
considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the following factors, as relevant:      

the nature and realizable value of any collateral;        

call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;        

the portfolio company s leverage and ability to make payments;        

the portfolio company s public or private credit rating;        

the portfolio company s actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;        

prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;        

the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and        

comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.      Investment performance
data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.  
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value
of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the
investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.    In addition, changes in the market environment
and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    US GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the
level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state
of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments  
      50  

Table of Contents  

with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree
of judgment applied in determining fair value.    Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the
observability of inputs used in determination of fair values, as follows:      

Level I inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in Level I generally include
unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact
the quoted price.        

Level II inputs to the valuation methodology are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date and are those other than quoted prices in active markets. The type of financial instruments in this
category generally includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on
observable inputs.        

Level III inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or
estimation. Financial instruments that are in this category generally include investments in privately-held entities, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
     In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such
cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Investment Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.    Transfer between levels,
if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur.    The Company generally uses the following framework
when determining the fair value of investments that are categorized as Level III:    Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated
to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market
value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Company carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used
to value its portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach
typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company.    Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient
coverage through the enterprise value analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis.  
 Investments in debt securities with sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash
flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s contractual interest, fees and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the
security s expected maturity date. The discount rate to be used is determined using an average of two market-based methodologies. Investments in debt securities may also be valued using consensus pricing.  
      51  

Table of Contents  

  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s
investments in first and second lien debt securities are discount rates and indicative quotes. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in indicative quotes in
isolation may result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.    The carrying values of the secured borrowings approximate their
respective fair values and are categorized as Level III within the hierarchy. Secured borrowings are valued generally using discounted cash flow analysis. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s
secured borrowings are discount rates. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.  
 The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value based on the short term nature of these items.  
 See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further information on fair value
measurements.      Use of Estimates    
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Management s estimates are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. It also requires management to
exercise judgment in the process of applying the Company s accounting policies. Assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of investments and their resulting impact on management fees involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity
and these assumptions and estimates may be significant to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material.

transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without
regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are
realized.      Revenue Recognition       Interest
from Investments and Realized Gain/Loss on Investments     Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of
discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized
cost of debt investments represents the original cost, including origination fees, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. At time of exit, the realized gain or loss on an investment is the difference between
the amortized cost at time of exit and the cash received at exit using the specific identification method.

  The Company may have loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind ( PIK )
provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity.  
  Other Income     Other income may include
income such as consent, waiver, amendment and syndication fees associated with the Company s investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized
as income when earned or the services are rendered. The Company may receive fees for guaranteeing the outstanding debt of a portfolio company. Such fees will be amortized into other income over the life of the guarantee. The unamortized amount, if
any, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  
  Non-Accrual Income     Loans are generally
placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is
placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status
when past due principal and interest are paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of
collection.      Income Taxes      For
federal income tax purposes, NFIC has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, NFIC must meet certain minimum distribution,
source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then NFIC is generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute.  
 The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require NFIC to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company
taxable income ( ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, NFIC may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI
must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.  
 In addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, NFIC is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income
unless NFIC distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending
October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by NFIC that is subject to corporate income tax is
considered to have been distributed. NFIC intends to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the excise distribution requirements.  
 The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to
determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely than not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense.  
 The Borrower Sub is a disregarded entity for tax purposes and is consolidated with the tax return of NFIC.

    Capital Calls and Dividends and Distributions to Common Stockholders    
 The Company records the shares issued in connection with capital calls as of the effective date of the capital call. To the extent that the
Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its common stockholders. Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date and paid in cash. The amount to be distributed
is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually, although the Company
may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
    We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates.  
   Valuation Risk      Our investments
may not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good
faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to
the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material.  
   Interest Rate Risk      As of
September 30, 2016, on a fair value basis, approximately 1% of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 99% of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors.
Interest rates on the investments held within the Company s portfolio of investments are typically based on floating LIBOR, with many of these investments also having a LIBOR floor. Additionally, the Company s credit facilities are also
subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating LIBOR rates.    Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change
in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future.  
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or
decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from the Company s settled portfolio of investments held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These hypothetical
calculations are based on a model of the settled investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on
interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the terms of the Company s credit facilities. Interest expense on the Company s
credit facilities is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with
borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may impact significantly our net interest income.

  The Company regularly measures exposure to interest rate risk. The Company assesses interest rate
risk and manages interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to
mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.    Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) and outstanding
secured borrowings assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:      
      Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer have concluded that our current
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act.  
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
 The Company may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently subject to any material legal
proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. See also Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors.   
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016, which is accessible on the SEC s website at sec.gov.      We may be exposed to special
risks associated with bankruptcy case.      One or more of our portfolio companies may be involved in bankruptcy or other
reorganization or liquidation proceedings. The reorganization of a company can involve substantial legal, professional and administrative costs to a lender and the borrower. It is subject to unpredictable and lengthy delays, and during the process a
company s competitive position may erode, key management may depart and a company may not be able to invest adequately. In some cases, the debtor company may not be able to reorganize and may be required to liquidate assets. The debt of
companies in financial reorganization will, in most cases, not pay current interest, may not accrue interest during reorganization and may be adversely affected by an erosion of the issuer s fundamental value. To the extent we and an affiliate
both hold investments in the same portfolio company that are of a different character, we may also face restrictions on our ability to become actively involved in the event that portfolio company becomes distressed as a result of the restrictions
imposed on transactions involving affiliates under the Investment Company Act. In such cases, we may be unable to exercise rights we may otherwise have to protect our interests as security holders in such portfolio company.  
   Our ability to extend financial commitments may be limited.    
 The SEC has proposed a new Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act that, if enacted in the form proposed, could adversely impact the way we
and other BDCs do business. In addition to imposing restrictions on the use of derivatives, the rule would generally limit our financial commitments to portfolio companies, together with our exposure to other transactions involving senior securities
entered into by us other than in reliance of the rule, to not more than 150 percent of our net asset value. We cannot assure you when or if the proposed rule will be adopted by the SEC, and if adopted, whether the final rule will constrain our
ability to extend financial commitments.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   
 Except as previously reported by the Company on Form 8-K, we did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that
were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   
 Not applicable.  
    Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.   
 Not applicable.
