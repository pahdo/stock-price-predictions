Note 1           Organization and Basis of Preparation 
    
  Nature of Operations.    Evolution Petroleum Corporation ("EPM") and its subsidiaries (the "Company", "we", "our" or "us"), is an independent petroleum company headquartered in Houston, Texas and incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are engaged primarily in the development of oil and gas reserves within known oil and gas resources utilizing conventional and proprietary technology. 
    
  Interim Financial Statements.    The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the appropriate rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  All adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented have been included.  The interim financial information and notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the Company s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  , as filed with the SEC. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation and Reporting.    Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EPM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements for the previous year include certain reclassifications that were made to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or stockholders' equity. As a result of the separation of our artificial lift technology operations at December 31, 2015, previously reported revenues for the Delhi field and our artificial lift technology operations have been reclassified as appropriate to crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and artificial lift technology service revenues. Before the reclassification, artificial lift technology revenues included crude oil, natural gas liquids and gas revenues produced by certain of the Company s operated wells which used our artificial lift technology, together with service revenues derived from the use of the Company s technology on third party wells. Previously reported production costs for our artificial lift technology operations have been reclassified as appropriate to oil and gas production costs and cost of artificial lift technology services. 
    
  Use of Estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include reserve quantities and estimated future cash flows associated with proved reserves, which significantly impact depletion expense and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties, income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and commitments and contingencies. We analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("   ASU 2014-09") one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. Issued in May 2014,  ASU 2014-09 provided guidance on revenue recognition on contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or on contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 requires that revenue recognition on contracts with customers depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For public companies, ASU 2014-09 would have been effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard provided for either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements, if any. 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which relates to the accounting for  leasing transactions.  This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. In addition, this standard requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning

     Table of Contents  
  Evolution Petroleum Corporation And Subsidiaries 
     Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements 

after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted. 
    
  The Company  early adopted  ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   to be applied prospectively effective for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This amended guidance simplifies the statement of financial position presentation and  reduces complexity in accounting for deferred income tax assets and liabilities.  The update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  As a result current deferred tax assets of   $105,321   have been netted together with noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities on the September 30, 2016 consolidated condensed balance sheet.  The prior period presented has not been retrospectively adjusted. 
    
  The Company early adopted  ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation:  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   effective for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This amended guidance simplifies and improves several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. Under previous guidance excess tax benefits were recognized as paid in capital to the extent they reduced cash taxes otherwise payable, and tax deficiencies were recognized as an offset to accumulated excess benefits, if any, or in the statement of operations. The new guidance requires companies to record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the statements of operations when the awards vest or are settled. Under the required modified retrospective transition, the Company had no cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption, as its accumulated excess tax benefits had been completely used in reducing taxable income for the year ended June 30, 2016. For vestings which occurred in the first quarter ended September 30, 2016, a related tax deficiency of   $215,594   was recognized in income tax expense.  The Company also elected to  prospectively adopt the presentation of excess tax benefits in the operating section of the statements of cash flow.  Accordingly, such statements for pre-adoption periods will continue to present excess tax benefits in the financing section. The amended guidance permits entities to make an accounting policy election  related to how forfeitures will impact the recognition of compensation cost for stock-based compensation: to continue to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered as currently required or, to be applied on a modified retrospective basis, to account for forfeitures as they occur. Upon early adoption, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. Except for income tax expense mentioned above, none of the other provisions in this amended guidance had a material impact on our condensed consolidated  financial statements.

Note 4       Property and Equipment 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , our oil and natural gas properties and other property and equipment consisted of the following: 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred capital expenditures of   $2.8 million   for the Delhi field, including approximately   $2.4 million   for the NGL plant project which is currently in progress.  We have incurred approximately   $23.9 million   on a cumulative basis for the NGL plant out of a total authorized commitment of   $24.6 million  . 
   
  Note 5           Other Assets 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , other assets consisted of the following: 

The Company accounts for its investment in Well Lift Inc. using the cost method under which any return of capital reduces cost and any dividends paid are recorded as income. Investment value will be evaluated for impairment at least quarterly or when management identifies any events or changes in circumstances that might have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. There is no published market value for this private investment, so it is not practicable to value it at fair market value on a periodic basis.

Note 6           Accrued Liabilities and Other 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , our other current liabilities consisted of the following: 

Accrued Restructuring Costs 
    
  On December 31, 2015 we terminated   three   employees of the Company in connection with the separation of our artificial lift technology operations. We recorded a personnel restructuring charge of   $688,205  , consisting of   $59,339   in stock-based compensation from accelerated vesting of equity awards and   $628,866   of accrued salary and benefit continuation expenses. The separation agreements included releases from liabilities and other provisions including agreements not to compete. Our  current estimate of remaining restructuring obligations as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

Note 7           Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  Our asset retirement obligations represent the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug, abandon and 
  remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives in accordance with applicable laws. The following is a 
  reconciliation of the beginning and ending asset retirement obligations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and for the year ended June 30, 2016: 

(a) We conveyed our interest in a well to the previous operator in exchange for the assumption of our asset retirement obligation. 
    
  (b) We expect to retire our   three   remaining operated wells within the next twelve months. After such operations are completed, our asset retirement obligations will consist entirely of our working interest obligations in the Delhi field.

Note 8    Stockholders  Equity 
    
     Common Stock 
    
  Commencing in December 2013, the Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at a quarterly rate of   $0.10   per share and subsequently adjusted this rate to   $0.05   per share during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company declared   one   quarterly dividend on its common stock and paid   $1,652,290   to its common stockholders. 
    
  On May 12, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program covering up to   $5 million   of the Company's common stock. Since commencing in June 2015,   265,762   shares have been repurchased at an average price of   $6.05   per share (totaling   $1,609,008  ). There has been   no   shares repurchased in the open market since mid-December 2015. Under the program's terms, shares are repurchased only on the open market and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such shares are initially recorded as treasury stock, then subsequently canceled.  The timing and amount of repurchases depends upon several factors, including financial resources and market and business conditions. There is no fixed termination date for this repurchase program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   58,147   shares of treasury stock at an average cost of   $5.68   per share (totaling   $330,070  ) from holders of newly vested stock-based awards to fund the recipients' payroll taxes paid in the quarter. The treasury shares were subsequently canceled. 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company purchased   173,790   shares of treasury stock at an average cost of   $5.75   per share (totaling   $999,731  ) under its share repurchase program and also acquired   1,073   shares of treasury stock at an average cost of   $5.50   per share (totaling   $5,906  ) from holders of newly vested stock-based awards to fund the recipients' payroll taxes paid in the quarter. All treasury shares were subsequently canceled. 
    
     Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Called for Redemption 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company declared the preferred dividend for the month of October 2016 and elected to redeem all    317,319   outstanding shares of the Company s   8.5%   Series A Cumulative (perpetual) Preferred Stock.  The redemption will occur on November 14, 2016 at the issue's   $25.00   per share liquidation value plus all accumulated and unpaid distributions from October 31, 2016 (the last dividend payment date before the redemption date) through the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of approximately   $25.082639   per share: 

(1) Includes the monthly dividend for October 2016 declared by the Company. 
  (2) Represents the difference between the redemption consideration and the historical carrying value of the preferred shares. Accordingly, net income was adjusted for this deemed dividend to determine net income attributable to common shareholders and earnings per common share. 
    
  The Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock cannot be converted into our common stock and there are   no   sinking fund or redemption rights available to the holders thereof. With respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stockholders, but subordinate to any of our existing and future debt.  Dividends on the Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock accrue and accumulate at a fixed rate of   8.5%   per annum on the   $25.00   per share liquidation preference, payable monthly at   $0.177083   per share, as, if and when declared by our Board of Directors through its Dividend Committee. We paid dividends of   $168,575   to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock during each of the   three months ended September 30,   2016 and 2015. 
    
  Expected Tax Treatment of Dividends 
    
  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we expect all preferred and common dividends to be treated for tax purposes as qualified dividend income to recipients.  Based on our current projections for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, we expect all common and remaining preferred dividends for such period will be treated as qualified dividend income.

Note 9   Stock-Based Incentive Plan 
    
  Under the terms of the Evolution Petroleum Corporation Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Plan (the "Plan"), we have granted option awards to purchase common stock (the "Stock Options"), restricted common stock awards ("Restricted Stock"), contingent restricted common stock awards ("Contingent Restricted Stock") and/or unrestricted fully vested common stock, to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. The Plan authorizes the issuance of   6,500,000   shares of common stock prior to its expiration on October 24, 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   64,236   shares remain available for grant under the Plan.   
    
  Stock Options 
    
  No Stock Options have been granted since August 2008 and all compensation costs attributable to Stock Options have been recognized in prior periods. The following summary presents information regarding outstanding Stock Options as of   September 30, 2016  , and the changes during the period:   

  (1) Based upon the difference between the market price of our common stock on the last trading date of the period (  $6.28   as of   September 30, 2016  ) and the Stock Option exercise price of in-the-money Stock Options. 
    
  Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock 
    
  Prior to August 28, 2014, all Restricted Stock grants contained a   four  -year vesting period based solely on service.  Restricted Stock which vests based solely on service is valued at the fair market value on the date of grant and amortized over the service period.   
    
  In August 2014, December 2015 and September 2016, the Company awarded grants of both Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock as part of its long-term incentive plan.  Such grants, which expire after   four   years if unvested, contain service-based, performance-based and market-based vesting provisions.  The common shares underlying the Restricted Stock grants were issued on the date of grant, whereas the Contingent Restricted Stock are reserved from the Plan, but will be issued only upon the attainment of specified performance-based or market-based vesting provisions.  
    
  Performance-based grants vest upon the attainment of earnings, revenue and other operational goals and require that the recipient remain an employee of the Company through the vesting date. The Company recognizes compensation expense for performance-based awards ratably over the expected vesting period based on the grant date fair value when it is deemed probable, for accounting purposes, that the performance criteria will be achieved. The expected vesting period may be deemed to be shorter than the   four  -year term. As of   September 30, 2016  , certain performance-based awards were not considered probable of vesting for accounting purposes and no compensation expense has been recognized with regard to these awards. If these awards are later determined to be probable of vesting, cumulative compensation expense will be recorded at that time and amortization would continue over the remaining expected vesting period. 
    
  Market-based awards granted in 2014 and 2015 entitle employees to vest in a fixed number of shares when the three-year trailing total return on the Company s common stock exceeds the corresponding total returns of various quartiles of companies comprising the SIG Exploration and Production Index (NASDAQ EPX) during defined measurement periods. Market-based awards granted in 2016 entitle employees to vest in a fixed number of shares when the three-year trailing total return on the Company s common stock exceeds the corresponding total returns of various quartiles of an index consisting of designated peer companies during defined measurement periods. The fair value and expected vesting period of these awards were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the historical volatility of the Company's total return compared to the historical volatilities of the other companies in the index. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we granted market-based

     Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements 

awards with grant date fair values ranging from   $3.42   to   $5.62   per share, all with an expected vesting period of   2.83   years, based on the various quartiles of comparative market performance. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we granted market-based awards with grant date fair values ranging from   $2.93   to   $5.07   per share, all with an expected vesting period of   3.83 years  , based on the various quartiles of comparative market performance.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we granted market-based awards with grant date fair values ranging from   $4.26   to   $8.40   per share and with expected vesting periods of   3.30 years   to   2.55 years  , based on the various quartiles of comparative market performance. Compensation expense for market-based awards is recognized over the expected vesting period using the straight-line method, so long as the award holder remains an employee of the Company. Total compensation expense is based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant and is independent of vesting or expiration of the awards, except for termination of service. 
    
  Unvested Restricted Stock awards at   September 30, 2016   consisted of the following:

  Stock-based compensation expense related to Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock grants for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $311,688   and   $218,115  , respectively.  
   
  Note 10           Derivatives 
  In early June 2015, the Company began using derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to crude oil price volatility for a substantial portion of its near-term forecasted production. The Company's objectives for this program were to achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support the Company s capital expenditure program and to provide better financial visibility for the payment of dividends on common stock. The Company uses both fixed price swap agreements and costless collars to manage its exposure to crude oil price risk. While these derivative instruments are intended to limit the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. 
  The Company does not intend to enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
  The Company accounts for derivatives under the provisions of ASC 815   Derivatives and Hedgin  g ("ASC 815") under which the Company records the fair value of the instruments on the balance sheet at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized in income.  Given cost and complexity considerations, the Company did not elect to use cash flow hedge accounting provided under ASC 815.  Under cash flow hedge accounting, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instruments would be deferred in other comprehensive income and not recognized in earnings until the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. 
  These derivative instruments can result in both fair value asset and liability positions held with each counterparty.  These positions are offset to a single net fair value asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. The Company nets its fair value amounts of derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty pursuant to ISDA master agreements, which provide for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties and believes it does not have significant credit risk.  Accordingly, we do not currently require our counterparties to post collateral to support the net asset positions of our derivative instruments. As such, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative instruments. 
  The Company held   no   crude oil derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and has not subsequently acquired any  crude oil derivative positions.

     Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded in the consolidated statement of operations a loss on derivative instruments of   $14,042   consisting of a realized gain of   $90   on settled derivatives and an unrealized net loss of   $14,132   on unsettled derivatives.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded in the consolidated statement of operations a gain on derivative instruments of   $1,938,389   consisting of a realized gain of   $866,427   on settled derivatives and an unrealized net loss of   $1,071,962   on unrealized derivatives.  
   
  Note 11           Fair Value Measurement 
    
  Accounting guidelines for measuring fair value establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. 
  The three levels are defined as follows: 
  Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2 Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
  Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which the Company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities. 
  The fair values of the Company s derivative assets and liabilities are based on a third-party industry-standard pricing model that uses market data obtained from third-party sources, including quoted forward prices for oil and gas, discount rates and volatility factors. The fair values are also compared to the values provided by the counterparty for reasonableness and are adjusted for the counterparty's credit quality for derivative assets and the Company s credit quality for derivative liabilities. To date, adjustments for credit quality have not had a material impact on the fair values. 
   
  Note 12           Income Taxes 
    
  We file a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States and various combined and separate filings in several state and local jurisdictions. 
    
  There were   no   unrecognized tax benefits nor any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We believe we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of various factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. The Company s federal and state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended June 30, 2013 through June 30, 2015 for federal tax purposes and for the years ended June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2015 for state tax purposes. To the extent we utilize net operating losses generated in earlier years, such earlier years may also be subject to audit. 
    
  We recognized income tax expense of   $889,176   and   $1,754,969   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, with corresponding effective rates of   33%   and   36%  . Our effective tax rate will typically differ from the statutory federal rate as a result of state income taxes, primarily in the State of Louisiana, and differences related to percentage depletion in excess of basis, stock-based compensation and other permanent differences. The lower effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   resulted primarily from percentage depletion in excess of basis, partially offset by state income taxes and the tax effects of stock-based compensation.

  Note 14   Senior Secured Credit Agreement 
    
  On April 11, 2016, the Company entered into a new   three  -year, senior secured reserve-based credit facility ("Facility") in an amount up to   $50 million  . The Facility replaces the Company's previous unsecured credit facility which expired in April 2016.  The initial borrowing base under the Facility was set at   $10,000,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Facility, and   no   amounts were outstanding under the Facility.  
   Proceeds from the Facility may be used for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and for letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Availability of borrowings under the Facility is subject to semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations. 
  The Facility included a placement fee of   0.50%   on the initial borrowing base, amounting to   $50,000  , and carries a commitment fee of   0.25%   per annum on the undrawn portion of the borrowing base. Any borrowings under the Facility will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either Libor plus   2.75%   or the Prime Rate, as defined, plus   1.00%  . The Facility  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents

contains financial covenants including a requirement that the Company maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (a) a maximum total leverage ratio of not more than   3.00   to 1.00, (b) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than   1.10   to 1.00, and (c) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than   $40 million  , all as defined under the Facility. 
  In connection with this agreement, the Company incurred   $168,972   of debt issuance costs.  Such costs were capitalized in Other Assets and are being amortized to expense. The unamortized balance in debt issuance costs related to the Facility was   $140,925   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Note 15   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  We are subject to various claims and contingencies in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time, we receive communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. At a minimum we disclose such matters if we believe it is reasonably possible that a future event or events will confirm a loss through impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability. We accrue a loss if we believe it is probable that a future event or events will confirm a loss and we can reasonably estimate such loss and we do not accrue future legal costs related to that loss. Furthermore, we will disclose any matter that is unasserted if we consider it probable that a claim will be asserted and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable. We expense legal defense costs as they are incurred. 
    
  On December 3, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, NGS Sub Corp., was served with a lawsuit filed in the 8th Judicial District Court of Winn Parish, Louisiana by Cecil M. Brooks and Brandon Hawkins, residents of Louisiana, alleging that in 2006 a former subsidiary of NGS Sub Corp. improperly disposed of water from an off-lease well into a well located on the plaintiffs  lands in Winn Parish. The plaintiffs requested monetary damages and other relief. NGS Sub Corp. divested its ownership of the property in question along with its ownership of the subsidiary in 2008 to a third party. The district court granted our exception of no right of action and dismissed certain claims against NGS Sub Corp. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended petition naming NGS Sub Corp. and the Company as defendants. NGS Sub Corp. and the Company have denied the plaintiffs  claims. Various pretrial motions filed on behalf of multiple parties were recently decided by the court and discovery is in process. We will continue to vigorously defend all claims by plaintiffs and consider the likelihood of a material loss to the Company in this matter to be remote.  
    
  Lease Commitments.    We have a non-cancelable operating lease for office space that expires on May 31, 2019. Future minimum lease commitments as of   September 30, 2016   under this operating lease are as follows:  

Rent expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $34,856   and   $45,043  , respectively.

Executive Overview 
    
  General 
    
  We are engaged primarily in the development of oil and gas reserves within known oil and gas resources utilizing conventional and proprietary technology. We are focused on increasing underlying asset values on a per share basis. In doing so, we depend on a conservative capital structure, allowing us to maintain control of our assets for the benefit of our stockholders, and a substantial stock ownership by our directors, officers and staff. By policy, every employee and director maintains a beneficial ownership in our common stock. 
    
  Our strategy is to grow the value of our Delhi asset to maximize the value realized by our stockholders.  
    
  We are currently funding our fiscal 2017 capital program from working capital and net cash flows from our properties. 
    
  Highlights for our First Quarter of Fiscal 2017 and Operations Update 
    
  "Current quarter" refers to the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's 1st quarter of fiscal 2017. 
    
  "Prior quarter" refers to the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's 4th quarter of fiscal 2016. 
    
  "Year-ago quarter" refers to the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company's 1st quarter of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Highlights 

We reported net income of $1.8 million in the current quarter. Our net income to common shareholders was $0.6 million, or $0.02 per share, which includes a nonrecurring, noncash deemed dividend of $1.0 million related to the redemption of our preferred stock and $0.3 million of final dividends on the preferred stock. 

Gross production in the Delhi field was 5.8% higher than the prior quarter, increasing to 7,371 barrels of oil equivalent per day ( BOEPD ) from 6,964 BOEPD, primarily from conformance and production enhancement operations. This production does not yet include expected volumes from the new Delhi NGL plant, which is scheduled for completion and start-up in the next fiscal quarter. 
     
   17 

     Table of Contents  

Our net production increased to 1,935 BOEPD, after a small 0.2% (.002) adjustment to our net revenue interest from the June 2016 litigation settlement. Our average realized price per equivalent barrel was $42.66, down slightly from the $42.87 average price in the prior quarter.   

We announced the redemption of all of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock.  Annual preferred dividend savings will amount to $674,302 per year. 

We ended the quarter with $19.6 million of working capital, substantially all of which was cash, after reduction for the $7.9 million commitment to retire our preferred stock.  We remain debt free.  
     Projects    
  Additional property and project information is included under   Item 1. Business, Item 2. Properties, Notes to the Financial Statements   and   Exhibit 99.4   of our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 
  Delhi Field - Enhanced Oil Recovery Project 
    
  Gross production at Delhi in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 averaged 7,371 barrels of oil per day ("BOPD"), an increase of 15% from the year-ago quarter, and a 5.8% increase from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in production volumes was primarily the result of conformance operations and other production enhancements which improved production rates. Our interests in the Delhi field consist of a 23.9% working interest (with associated 19.0% net revenue interest) and separate royalty interests of 7.2%.  This yields a total net revenue interest of 26.2%. 
    
  Field operating expenses were $13.14 per barrel in the current quarter compared to $11.72 in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of higher purchased CO   2    costs. In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our net share of lease operating expenses was approximately $2.3 million, of which $1.1 million is related to CO   2    purchases and transportation expenses.  Under our contract with the operator, purchased CO   2    is priced at 1% of the realized oil price in the field per thousand cubic feet ( Mcf ) plus sales taxes of 8% plus transportation costs of $0.20 per Mcf.  CO   2    costs increased 26% from the prior quarter as a result of higher purchased field volumes which averaged 73.7 MMcf per day gross compared to 58.7 MMcf per day in the prior quarter.  Total CO   2    injection volumes increased during the summer, with a corresponding increase in purchased volumes.  Our cost of purchased CO   2    is tied directly to realized oil prices in the field, so our cost per Mcf was largely unchanged from quarter to quarter.  On a total BOE basis, CO   2    costs increased 19% from $5.09 per BOE in the prior quarter to $6.06 per BOE. 
    
  Based on recent discussions with the operator, the fabrication, construction and installation of the NGL plant is essentially complete, with initial plant startup scheduled for November 2016. The plant had a total estimated cost of $24.6 million net to the Company, of which approximately $23.9 million had been incurred as of   September 30, 2016  . The June 30, 2016 reserves report includes projected peak gross proved production volumes of approximately 1,850 barrels of liquids per day from the NGL plant over the next five years.  The methane removed by the plant will be converted to electricity to supply power for the NGL plant and reduce electricity costs for the recycling facility.  The NGL plant is also expected to increase the sweep efficiency and recovery of the CO   2    flood by removing hydrocarbons for the recycle stream.   
    
  Late in fiscal 2016, the operator began a $2.5 million gross ($0.6 million net to Evolution) project to restore production in the southwestern portion of the field.  Following the fluid release event in June 2013, CO   2    injections in this area ceased in order to reduce reservoir pressure and protect the incident area. The project encompassed converting three shut-in wells to water injector wells in order to expand the water curtain barrier to reduce CO   2    migration and the installation of three electrical submersible pumps ("ESP") in other shut-in wells in order to increase withdrawal rates and help maintain the targeted reservoir pressure. These ESP production wells created a modified waterflood, which began producing in September 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We had   $28.2 million   and   $34.1 million   in cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   and June 30, 2016, respectively. In addition, we had $10.0 million of availability under our senior secured reserve-based credit facility. 
    
  On April 11, 2016, the Company entered into a new   three  -year, senior secured reserve-based credit facility ("Facility")  with MidFirst Bank. The Facility provides a senior secured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of    $10 million   (the  Borrowing Base ) and a maximum borrowing amount of $50 million. The Facility matures on April 11, 2019, and is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. 
    
  The Borrowing Base is subject to periodic redeterminations and further adjustments from time to time. The Borrowing Base will be redetermined semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Borrowing Base will also be reduced in certain circumstances such as the sale or disposition of certain oil and gas properties of the Company or its subsidiaries and changes to certain hedging positions. With the recent volatility in commodity prices, our borrowing base and related commitments under the Facility could be reduced in the future. The Facility bears interest, at the Company's option, at either LIBOR plus 2.75% or the Prime Rate, as defined, plus 1.0%.  
    
  The Facility contains certain covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of (i) a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0, (ii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.1 to 1.0 and (iii) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than $40 million, each as defined in the Facility.  The Facility also contains other affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the Facility.  
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we funded our operations with cash generated from operations and cash on hand.  At   September 30, 2016  , our working capital was   $19.6 million  , compared to working capital of   $28.6 million   at June 30, 2016.  The $9.0 million decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the $7.9 million accrual of preferred stock called for redemption. 
    
  Capital Budget - Delhi Field 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred $2.8 million of capital expenditures, which includes $2.4 million for the NGL plant and $0.4 million for other field capital. 
  For fiscal 2017, we expect approximately $3.0 to $4.0 million in final spending for the NGL plant.  As of September 30, 2016, we had incurred approximately $23.9 million of cumulative capital costs for the NGL plant out of an original commitment of $24.6 million. The remaining committed capital costs are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of calendar 2016 and the completed cost of the project is expected to be largely within the original budget.  In late September and October, we approved eleven small capital workover projects for continuing conformance operations in the Delhi field, totaling approximately $3.8 million ($0.9 million net to us).  There are three workover rigs operating in the field and we expect all of these operations to be completed by the end of the year.  These new projects result from the demonstrated benefits from previous conformance efforts and the significant returns that have been realized from relatively modest capital investments in the field.  These conformance projects add production and cash flow in a very short time frame after investment.   In addition, there will likely be other spending on unbudgeted capital projects for capital workovers or production enhancement during the current fiscal year, which we do not expect to have a material effect on our financial position. 
   Funding for our anticipated capital expenditures over the next two fiscal years is expected to be met from cash flows from operations and current working capital. Our preference is to remain debt free under our current operating plans, but we have access to a senior secured credit facility for oil and gas development if required.  In addition, we have an effective shelf registration statement with Securities and Exchange Commission. We may choose to evaluate new growth opportunities through acquisitions or other transactions. In that event, we would expect to use our internal resources of cash, working capital and borrowing capacity under our credit facility. It may also be advantageous for us to consider issuing additional equity as part of any potential transaction, but we have no specific plans to do so at this time.  
  Our liquidity is highly dependent on the realized prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce. Commodity prices are market driven and historically volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. In June 2015, the Company began using derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to oil price volatility with the goal to achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support the Company s capital expenditure and dividend programs. The Company uses both fixed price swap agreements and costless collars to manage its exposure to crude oil price risk. We have no derivative commitments beyond September 30, 2016 at this time. While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. Our future revenues, cash flow,  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth are significantly impacted by the prices we receive for our production. Liquidity could also be affected by any litigation outcome, positive or negative.   
  Payment of free cash flow in excess of our operating and capital requirements through cash dividends and potential repurchases of our common stock remains a priority of our financial strategy, and it is our long term goal to increase our dividends over time as appropriate. 
  The Board of Directors and management instituted a cash dividend on our common stock in December 2013 at an initial quarterly rate of $0.10 per common share. As a result of the decline in oil prices which began in the fall of 2014, combined with the anticipated cost of building and installing the Delhi NGL plant during calendar years 2015 and 2016, the Board of Directors concluded it was prudent to adjust the quarterly dividend rate from $0.10 per share to $0.05 per share, effective beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. With the NGL plant construction commitment largely complete, the Company announced in November 2016 an increase in the common stock cash dividend to $0.065 per share effective with the dividend payment in the following month. 
  In May 2015, we established a stock repurchase plan to allow us acquire up to $5.0 million of our common stock over time, of which we have approximately $3.4 million remaining. The actual timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including financial resources and market conditions.  In general, our share repurchase program is limited to discretionary funds and is of lesser importance than our primary objectives related to our development capital spending at Delhi and our common stock dividend program.  There is no fixed termination date for the repurchase program, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.   
   On September 30, 2016 the Board of Directors approved the redemption of all of the Company's 8.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock to occur on November 14, 2016. Though reduced by this transaction, working capital remains at a healthy level and the Company also has access to capital at a significantly lower cost from its existing undrawn credit facility. 
     Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows provided by operating activities were   $1.5 million  , reflecting   $1.8 million   of cash provided by net income, $2.3 million provided by adjustments reconciling net income to cash provided by operating activities, and   $2.7 million   used by changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
       
   For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , cash flows provided by operating activities were   $2.2 million  , which included   $0.4 million   used by other working capital items.  Of the   $2.7 million   provided before other working capital changes, approximately   $3.1 million   was due to net income that was partly offset by $0.4 million of non-cash items. 
    
     Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Investing activities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   used $5.2 million of cash, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of approximately $4.8 million for the Delhi field and $0.3 million for derivative settlements paid. 
    
  Investing activities for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   used $6.0 million of cash, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of approximately $6.6 million for Delhi field offset by $0.6 million of derivative settlements received. 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , financing activities used   $2.2 million   of cash, consisting of   $1.8 million   of dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders and   $0.3 million   of common share repurchases related to shares surrendered for tax withholding. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , financing activities were cash neutral as $1.8 million of common and preferred shares' cash dividend payments and $1.2 million of treasury acquisitions, primarily attributable to the Company's share buyback program, were offset by $3.0 million of cash provided by tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.  These tax benefits include the $1.5 million impact of the cash refund received from the State of Louisiana for previously filed carryback returns.

Full Cost Pool Ceiling Test and Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
    For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our capitalized costs of oil and gas properties were well below the full cost valuation ceiling. We do not currently expect that a write-down of capitalized oil and gas property costs will be required in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017. However, lower oil prices reduced the excess, or cushion, of our valuation ceiling over our capitalized costs in the current quarter and may adversely impact our ceiling tests in future quarters. Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD A and related deferred taxes, are limited to: the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10%; plus the cost of any properties not being amortized; plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized; less the income tax effect related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties (the valuation  ceiling ). If capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess would be charged to expense as a write-down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurred. The quarterly ceiling test calculation requires that we use the average price received for our petroleum products during the twelve month period ending with the balance sheet date. If commodity prices remain at the current quarter s lower levels, the average prices used in future ceiling test calculations will decline. We cannot give assurance that a write-down of capitalized oil and gas properties will not be required in the future.  
  Our proved undeveloped reserves in the Delhi field consist primarily of the NGL plant and development of the remaining eastern part of the field.  Remaining estimated capital expenditures amount to $8.12 per BOE for the Phase V expansion of the CO   2    flood in the undeveloped eastern part of the field included in proved undeveloped reserves.  Given the geology of the Delhi field, no remaining estimated capital expenditures are required to develop our probable or possible reserves as these reserves reflect incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for proved reserves. The NGL plant is essentially completed and we expect the first full month of production in December 2016. The expanded development of the eastern part of the Delhi field was commenced upon the reversion of our working interest in November 2014. Shortly thereafter, the operator reduced its capital budget and temporarily postponed development of the eastern part of the Delhi field. Resumption of this development project is dependent, at least in part, on the operator's allocation of available capital to projects within their portfolio. Both we and the operator believe that it is prudent to complete the NGL plant before continuing with future development of the field as the plant is projected to improve subsequent field economics. At this time, despite lower commodity price levels, we continue to believe that these projects are economically viable and it is probable they will be executed within the next several years. We base our analysis on the current lifting costs in the field and the relatively low future development costs per BOE.  Therefore, we believe these reserves remain properly classified as proved undeveloped reserves under SEC guidelines.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated net income to common shareholders of   $0.6 million  , or   $0.02   per diluted share, on total revenues of   $7.6 million  . This compares to net income of $2.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, on total revenues of $7.4 million for the year-ago period.  The   $2.4 million   earnings decrease resulted from $2.0 million decrease in derivative gains, $1.1 million from a year-ago insurance recovery, and a $1.1 million increase in allocated net income to holders of called preferred shares, partially offset by $0.2 million of higher revenue, $0.7 million of lower operating costs and    $0.9 million   of lower income taxes. 
  Oil and Gas Production.   Revenues increased 3% to $7.6 million  primarily as a result of a 13% increase in production volumes from the year-ago period, partially offset by a 9% decline in realized prices from $46.66 per equivalent barrel to $42.66 per barrel in the current period. Delhi oil production and revenues comprise virtually all of our revenues. Delhi gross production of 7,371 BOPD was 14.8% higher compared to the year-ago period as a result of production enhancement and conformance operations in the field. 
  Production Costs  . Production costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.3 million, a $0.3 million decrease from the year-ago quarter primarily attributable to the Delhi field. Delhi production costs for the current period were $2.3 million of which $1.1 million was for CO   2    costs, compared to $2.6 million, of which $1.4 million was for CO   2    costs, in the year-ago period.  Average gross injection volumes decreased from 89,705 Mcf per day in the year-ago period to 73,747 Mcf per day for the current quarter. For the current quarter, production costs were $13.17 per BOE on total production volumes. Production costs were $18.09 per BOE calculated solely on our Delhi working interest volumes, which includes $8.35 per working interest BOE for CO   2    costs. These latter production costs per BOE exclude production volumes from our royalty interests in the Delhi field, which bear no production costs, and are therefore higher than the rates per BOE on our total production volumes. 
  General and Administrative Expenses ( G A ).   G A expenses decreased   $0.4 million  , or   27%  , to   $1.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the year-ago period primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in litigation costs and a lower salary and benefit expenses. 
  Other Income and Expenses  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , aggregate other items decreased $3.0 million from the year-ago quarter due to a $2.0 million decrease in derivative gains and a year-ago $1.1 million gain from an insurance recovery at the Delhi field. 
  Depreciation, Depletion   Amortization Expense ( DD A ).    DD A increased   $0.1 million  , or   5%  , to   $1.3 million   for the current period compared to   $1.2 million   for the year-ago period as a result of   $0.1 million   of higher amortization of the full cost pool, partially offset by lower depreciation on fixed assets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the increase in full cost pool amortization was due to a   13%    production increase to 178,009 BOE, partially offset by a   6%   lower amortization rate of    $7.11   per BOE. The rate decrease is primarily due to lower future development costs compared to the year-ago quarter as certain proved undeveloped reserves, particularly Phase VI area,  were found to be uneconomical at June 30, 2016. 
  Other Economic Factors 
  Inflation  .  Although the general inflation rate in the United States, as measured by the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index, has been relatively low in recent years, the oil and gas industry has experienced unusually volatile price movements in commodity prices, vendor goods and oilfield services. Prices for drilling and oilfield services, oilfield equipment, tubulars, labor, expertise and other services greatly impact our lease operating expenses and our capital expenditures. During fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 to date, we have seen some declines in operating and capital costs as a result of lower demand and excess supply of goods and services in the industry. Product prices, operating costs and development costs may not always move in tandem. 
  Known Trends and Uncertainties  .  General worldwide economic conditions, as well as economic conditions for the oil and gas industry specifically, continue to be uncertain and volatile. Concerns over uncertain future economic growth are affecting numerous industries and companies, as well as consumers, which impact demand for crude oil and natural gas. If the supply of crude oil and natural gas continues to exceed demand in the future, it may put downward pressure on crude oil and natural gas prices, thereby lowering our revenues, profits, cash flow and working capital going forward.  
  Seasonality  .  Our business is generally not directly seasonal, except for instances when weather conditions may adversely affect access to our properties or delivery of our petroleum products.  Although we do not generally modify our production for changes in market demand, we do experience seasonality in the product prices we receive, driven by summer cooling and driving, winter heating, and extremes in seasonal weather, including hurricanes, that may substantially affect oil and natural gas production and imports.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements to report during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
  Information about market risks for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , did not change materially from the disclosures in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Our most significant market risk is the pricing for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. We expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable. If energy prices decline significantly, our revenues and cash flow would significantly decline. In addition, a non-cash write-down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if future oil and gas commodity prices sustained a significant decline. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as, if and when needed. We may use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk from time to time based on our assessment of such risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk    
  We currently have only a small exposure to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.  Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to this Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the quarter covered by this report.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives.  Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016   our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   we have determined there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
