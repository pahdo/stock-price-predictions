   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
     
  This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current or prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Words such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   believes,   seeks,   estimates,   would,   should,   targets,   projects,  and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements.  
     
  The factors listed under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 25, 2016, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial position. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements:  
     
                        Potential fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
                        Potential impact of economic recessions or downturns 
                        Adverse developments in the credit markets 
                        Operation in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities 
                        Regulations governing our operation as a business development company 
                        Financing investments with borrowed money 
                        Lack of liquidity in investments 
                        Defaults by portfolio companies 
                        Uncertainty as to the value of certain portfolio investments 
                        Potential resignation of the Advisor and or the Administrator 
                        Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income 
                        Potential adverse effects of price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets 
                        Risks associated with original issue discount ( OID ) and payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest income 
                        Risks regarding distributions 
                        Potential adverse effects of new or modified laws and regulations 
     
  Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based upon are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the 1934 Act, which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company.

   NOTES TO    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)   
     
   Note    1. Organization and Basis of Presentation  
     
  Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on February 5, 2015  ( Inception ) as a Delaware corporation structured as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company commenced investment operations on June 26, 2015 ( Commencement ). The Company has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a  RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. 
     
  The Company is managed by CBDC Advisors, LLC (the  Advisor ), an investment adviser that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. CBDC Administration, LLC (the  Administrator ) provides the administrative services necessary for the Company to operate. Company management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Advisor and Administrator along with the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ). The Advisor directs and executes the investment operations and capital raising activities of the Company subject to oversight from the Board, which sets the broad policies of the Company. The Board has delegated investment management of the Company s investment assets to the Advisor. The Board consists of five directors, three of whom are independent.  
     
  On July 23, 2015, the Company formed CBDC Universal Equity, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary. This subsidiary allows the Company to hold equity securities of a portfolio company organized as a pass-through entity while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. On February 25, 2016, the Company formed Crescent Capital BDC Funding, LLC ( CBDC SPV ), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary. The financial statements of these two entities are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
     
  The Company s primary investment objective is to maximize the total return to the Company s stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments.  The Company will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. The Company may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, directly from its target companies as primary market or directly originated investments or through secondary market transactions in the  over-the-counter  market.  Although the Company s focus is to invest in directly originated transactions, in certain circumstances it will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets.

   Note    2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
     
   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of the  consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments that in the opinion of management are necessary for the fair statement of the results for the periods presented. Although management believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
     
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
     
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments (e.g., money market funds, U.S. Treasury notes, and similar type instruments) with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents other than money market mutual funds, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Money market mutual funds are carried at their net asset value, which approximates fair value. The Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with highly-rated banking corporations and, at times, cash deposits may exceed the insured limits under applicable law.  
     
   Investment    Transactions  
     
  Investments purchased on a secondary market are recorded on the trade date. Loan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment. Realized gains or losses are recorded on the First In, First Out ( FIFO ) method as the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments written off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment fair values as of the last business day of the reporting period and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.  
     
   Investment    Valuation  
     
  Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Advisor, the Company s Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.  
     
 19   

Table of Contents   
     
  The Board oversees and supervises a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:  
     
                        The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. 
                        The Advisor s management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. 
                        The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. 
                        The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Advisor, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties. 
     
  The Company currently conducts this valuation process on a quarterly basis.  
     
  In connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board will engage independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified.  
     
  The Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820,  Fair Value Measurement  (ASC 820), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in the determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:  
     
  Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.  
     
  Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.  
     
  Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  
     
  In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company applies the valuation policy approved by its Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Company subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for classification as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, the Company reviews pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfers occur. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $17,000,233 in transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in observable inputs in market data.  
     
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.  
     
 20   

Table of Contents   
     
   In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected    herein. See Note 4. Investments and Note 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional information on the Company s investment portfolio. 
     
   Foreign Currency   
     
  Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:  
     
                        cash and cash equivalents, fair value of investments, outstanding debt on revolving credit facilities, other assets and liabilities: at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and 
     
                        purchases and sales of investments, borrowings and repayments of such borrowings, income and expenses: at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 
     
  Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, the Company does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are included with net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fluctuations arising from the translation of foreign currency on investments and borrowings are included with net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currency translation on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
     
  The Company s current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in its non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow local currency under the Company s revolving credit facility to partially or fully fund these investments.  
     
   Equity Offering and Organization Expenses   
     
  The Company has agreed to repay the Advisor for initial organization costs and equity offering costs incurred prior to the commencement of its operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million on a pro rata basis over the first $350 million of invested capital not to exceed 3 years from the initial capital commitment on June 26, 2015. To the extent such costs relate to equity offerings, these costs are charged as a reduction of capital upon the issuance of common shares. To the extent such costs relate to organization costs, these costs are expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon the issuance of common shares. The Advisor is responsible for organization and private equity offerings costs in excess of $1.5 million. See Note 7. Commitments, Contingencies and Indemnifications for additional discussion of certain related party transactions with the Advisor.  
     
   Debt Issuance Costs   
     
  The Company records  costs related to issuance of debt obligations as deferred financing costs. These costs are deferred and amortized using the effective yield method, or straight-line method for revolving credit facilities, over the stated maturity life of the obligation. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $1,122,389 and $218,269, respectively, of deferred financing costs on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
     
   Interest and Dividend Income Recognition   
     
  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of  purchase discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums, if any. 
     
 21   

Table of Contents   
     
   Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income from common equity securities is    recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. 
     
  Certain investments have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal or cost basis of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Accrued PIK interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively, when an investment is placed on non-accrual status.  
     
  Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no loans had been placed on non-accrual status by the Company.  
     
   Other Income   
     
  From time to time, the Company may receive fees for services provided to portfolio companies by the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The services that the Advisor provides vary by investment, but generally include syndication, structuring or diligence fees, and fees for providing managerial assistance to  the portfolio companies. The Company may also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized; such amounts are accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan. Fees for providing managerial assistance to the portfolio companies are generally non-recurring and are recognized as revenue when services are provided. 
     
  In certain instances where the Company is invited to participate as a co-lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment, all or a portion of any loan fees received by the Company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the investment s life using the effective yield method.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  The Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company s stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  
     
  The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, all tax filings of the Company since the inception on February 5, 2015 remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities. No such examinations are currently pending.  
     
 22   

Table of Contents   
     
  In order for the Company not to be subject to federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (ii) 98.2% of its net capital gains from the current year and (iii) any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required.  
     
  CBDC Universal Equity, Inc. has elected to be a taxable entity (the  Taxable Subsidiary ). The Taxable Subsidiary permits the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are  pass through  entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the  source income  requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes is required in the consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Dividends    and Distributions  
     
  Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.  
     
  The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of the Company s stockholders for those stockholders electing not to receive cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend, then the Company s stockholders who have  opted in  to the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend.  
     
   New Accounting Standards   
     
  In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014 15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205   40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .  ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. 
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
 23   

Table of Contents   
     
  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02: Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, that amends the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. The changes are extensive and apply to all companies. The need to assess an entity under a different consolidation model may change previous consolidation conclusions. This ASU is effective for public reporting entities in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 for nonpublic business entities. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2015-02, if any.  
     
   Note    3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions  
     
   Administration Agreement   
     
  On June 2, 2015, the Company entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services to the Company. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Administrator under the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, the Administrator is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties. To the extent the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Company will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis, without incremental profit to the Administrator.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred administrative services expenses of $136,926 and $382,644, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, under the terms of the Administration Agreement, of which $142,431 was payable at September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015, the Company incurred administrative services expenses of $107,186 and $112,934, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, under the terms of the Administration Agreement, of which $108,169 was payable at September 30, 2015.  
     
  Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until June 2, 2017, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days  written notice to the other party.  
     
  No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Administrator or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Administrator (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Administrator or its affiliates to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other professionals who spend time on such related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company). The allocable portion of the compensation for these officers and other professionals are included in the administration expenses paid to Administrator. Directors who are not affiliated with the Administrator or its affiliates receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings.  
     
  On June 5, 2015, the Company entered into sub-administration, accounting, transfer agent, and custodian agreements with State Street Bank and Trust Company ( SSB ) to perform certain administrative, custodian, transfer agent and other services on behalf of the Company. The sub-administration agreements with SSB have an initial term of three years ending June 5, 2018. The Company does not reimburse the Administrator for any services for which it pays a separate sub-administrator and custodian fee to SSB. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred expenses of $157,752 and $464,189, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, under the terms of the sub-administration agreements, of which $156,604 was payable at September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015, the Company incurred expenses of $143,614 and $144,036, respectively,

  which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, under the terms of the sub-administration agreements, of which $162,431 was payable at September 30, 2015.  
     
   Investment Advisory Agreement   
     
  On June 2, 2015, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advis or will provide investment advisory services to the Company and its portfolio investments. The Advisor s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Advisor is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Advisor the Base Management Fee, as discussed below, and may also pay certain Incentive Fees, as discussed below. 
     
  The Base Management Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.5% of the Company s gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter.  
     
  The Advisor, however, has agreed to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of the sum of (i) 0.25% of the aggregate committed but undrawn capital and (ii) 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents (including capital drawn to pay the Company s expenses) during any period prior to a qualified initial public offering, as defined by the Investment Advisory Agreement ( Qualified IPO ). The Advisor will not be permitted to recoup any waived amounts at any time and the waiver agreement may only be modified or terminated prior to a Qualified IPO with the approval of the Board. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper maturing within one year of purchase.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred management fees, which are net of waived amounts, of $432,213 and $1,179,301, respectively, of which $432,213 was payable at September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015, the Company incurred management fees, which are net of waived amounts, of $261,407 and $269,316, respectively, of which $261,406 was payable at September 30, 2015.  
     
  The Incentive Fees consists of two parts. The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and (a) equals 100% of the excess of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of 1.5% per quarter (6% annualized) (the  Hurdle ), and a catch-up feature until the Advisor has received, (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 15%, or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 17.5%, of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter up to, (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 1.7647%, or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 1.8182% (the  Catch-up ), and (b) (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 15% or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 17.5%, of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the  Catch-up.   
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred income incentive fees of $63,956 and $63,956, respectively, of which $63,956 was payable at September 30, 2016. The Company did not incur any income incentive fees for the three months ended September 30, 2015 or for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015.  
     
  The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon a Qualified IPO or termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement), (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 15.0%, or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 17.5% of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. If a Qualified IPO occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the income incentive fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after a Qualified IPO based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after a Qualified IPO. If a Qualified IPO occurs on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, a capital gains incentive fee shall be calculated as of the day before the Qualified IPO, with such capital gains incentive fee paid to the Advisor following the end of the fiscal year in which the Qualified IPO occurred. For the  
     
 25   

Table of Contents   
     
  avoidance of doubt, such capital gains incentive fee shall be equal to 15.0% of the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the day before the Qualified IPO, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Following a Qualified IPO, solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the Company will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to a Qualified IPO equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to a Qualified IPO by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5% by (y) 15.0%. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee.  
     
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during each calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for such quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding debt or preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market discount, OID, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income will be compared to a  Hurdle Amount  equal to the product of (i) the Hurdle rate of 1.50% per quarter (6.00% annualized) and (ii) our net assets, at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a  catch-up  provision incurred at the end of each calendar quarter. Our net pre-incentive fee investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.5% Base Management Fee.

   Note    4. Investments  
     
  The Company s investments at any time may include securities and other financial instruments or other assets of any sort, including, without limitation, corporate and government bonds, convertible securities, collateralized loan obligations, term loans, trade claims, equity securities, privately negotiated securities, direct placements, working interests, warrants and investment derivatives (such as credit default swaps, recovery swaps, total return swaps, options, forward contracts, and futures) (all of the foregoing collectively referred to in these  consolidated financial statements as  investments ). 
     
  Under the 1940 Act, the Company is required to separately identify non-controlled investments where it owns 5% or more of a portfolio company s outstanding voting securities and/or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company as investments in  affiliated  companies. In addition, under the 1940 Act, the Company is required to separately identify investments where it owns more than 25% of a portfolio company s outstanding voting securities and/or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company as investments in  controlled  companies. Detailed information with respect to the Company s non-controlled, non-affiliated; non-controlled, affiliated; and controlled affiliated investments is contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The information in the tables below is presented on an aggregate portfolio basis, without regard to whether they are non-controlled non-affiliated, non-controlled affiliated or controlled affiliated investments. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all investments held are non-controlled/non-affiliated investments.  
     
  Certain Risk Factors  
     
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company manages a variety of risks including market risk  and liquidity risk. The Company identifies, measures and monitors risk through various control mechanisms, including trading limits and diversifying exposures and activities across a variety of instruments, markets and counterparties. 
     
  Market risk is the risk of potential adverse changes to the value of financial instruments because of changes in market conditions, including as a result of changes in the credit quality of a particular issuer, credit spreads, interest rates, and other movements and volatility in security prices or commodities. In particular, the Company may invest in issuers that are experiencing or have experienced financial or business difficulties (including difficulties resulting from the initiation or prospect of significant litigation or bankruptcy proceedings), which involves significant risks. The Company manages its exposure to market risk through the use of risk management strategies and various analytical monitoring techniques.  
     
  The Company s investments may, at any time, include securities and other financial instruments or obligations that are illiquid or thinly traded, making purchase or sale of such securities and financial instruments at desired prices or in desired quantities difficult. Furthermore, the sale of any such investments may be possible only at substantial discounts, and it may be extremely difficult to value any such investments accurately.  
     
  Investments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin, including unanticipated movements in the value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

  The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for total investments that use Level 3 inputs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 based off of fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2016:  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $17,000,233 in transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in observable inputs in market data.  
     
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for total investments that use Level 3 inputs for the period from June 26, 2015 (Commencement) through  September 30, 2015 based off of fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2015: 

The following table s present the fair value of Level 3 investments and the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company s Level 3 investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of investment. These inputs are not representative of the inputs that could have been used in the valuation of any one investment. For example, the highest market yield presented in the table for senior secured first lien investments is appropriate for valuing a specific investment but may not be appropriate for valuing any other investment. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company s Level 3 investments.

  Quantitative information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  

(1) The range for an investment type category consisting of a single investment represents the relevant market data considered in determining the fair value of the investment.  
     
  As noted above, the discounted cash flows, market rate and market multiple approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The significant unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow approach is the discount rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market rate approach are the effective yield on a loan given its current fair value mark and the market yields for that type of loan. An increase in the market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market multiple approach are the multiples of similar companies  earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and comparable market transactions. Increases or decreases in market EBITDA multiples would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value.

Proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for investment activities, expenses, working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. The Company s obligations to the lenders are secured by a first priority security interest in the unused capital commitments (See Note 7. Commitments, Contingencies and Indemnifications) and certain investments and cash held by the Company. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to maintaining an asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings of at least 2 to 1. The maximum principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is $50 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. On October 23, 2015, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility to include a multi-currency tranche allowing the Company to borrow up to 15% of the principal amount committed under an alternative currency including Euro, Canadian Dollar and Pound Sterling (GBP). On June 29, 2016, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility decreasing the facility limit from $75 million to $50 million and extending the maturity date to June 29, 2017.  
     
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either (i) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin with no LIBOR floor or (ii) at lenders  cost of funds plus a margin. The Company may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of draw-down, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The Company pays unused facility fees of 0.20% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on June 29, 2017.

  The maximum commitment amount under the SPV Asset Facility is $75 million, and may be increased with the consent of Wells Fargo or reduced upon request of the Company. Proceeds of the advances under the SPV Asset Facility may be used to acquire portfolio investments, to make distributions to the Company in accordance with the SPV Asset Facility, and to pay related expenses. The maturity date is the earlier of: (a) the date the Borrower voluntarily reduces the commitments to zero, (b) the Facility Maturity Date (March 28, 2021) and (c) the date upon which Wells Fargo declares the obligations due and payable after the occurrence of an Event of Default. Borrowings under the SPV Asset Facility bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin with no LIBOR floor. The Company pays unused facility fees of 0.50% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the SPV Asset Facility. The SPV Asset Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature.  
     
  Also on March 28, 2016, the Company, as Seller, and CBDC SPV, as Purchaser, entered into a loan sale agreement whereby the Company will sell certain assets to CBDC SPV. CBDC SPV will be consolidated into the Company s financial statements and no gain or loss is expected to result from the sale of assets to CBDC SPV. The Company retains a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by CBDC SPV through its 100% ownership of CBDC SPV. The facility size is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the amount of CBDC SPV s assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test and certain concentration limits.  
     
  Costs incurred in connection with obtaining the SPV Asset Facility have been recorded as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the life of the SPV Asset Facility on a straight-line basis. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, deferred financing costs related to the SPV Asset Facility were $1,001,493 and $0, respectively, and were included in debt on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

The Advisor directs and executes the investment operations and capital raising activities of the Company subject to oversight from the Board, which sets the broad policies of the Company. The Board has delegated investment management of the Company s investment assets to the Advisor.  The Board consists of five directors, three of whom are independent.  
     
  The Company s primary investment objective is to maximize the total return to the Company s stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in secured debt (including senior secured first-lien, unitranche and senior secured second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments or through secondary market transactions in the  over-the-counter  market. We invest in directly originated transactions and the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets.  
     
  From February 5, 2015 (Inception) through June 25, 2015, the Company devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing the business and raising capital commitments from private investors. On June 26, 2015, we entered into subscription agreements with several investors, including Crescent Capital Group LP and its affiliates (CCG LP), providing for the private placement of the Company s common stock.  The Company commenced investment operations on June 26, 2015 (Commencement).  
     
   KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
   Investments   
     
  We expect our investment activity to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us, the level of merger and acquisition activity for middle-market companies, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to such companies and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.

   We must not invest in any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the investments are made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC,  eligible portfolio    companies  include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million. 
     
   The Investment Advisor   
     
  Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor, which will be responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.  The Advisor has entered into a Resource Sharing Agreement (the  Resource Sharing Agreement ) with Crescent Capital Group LP ( CCG LP ), pursuant to which CCG LP will provide the Advisor with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Advisor s investment committee) and access to the resources of CCG LP so as to enable the Advisor to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Advisor intends to capitalize on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of CCG LP s investment professionals.  
     
   Revenues   
     
  We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable.  
     
  Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.  
     
  In addition, we may receive fees for services provided to portfolio companies by the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The services that the Advisor provides vary by investment, but generally include syndication, structuring or diligence fees, and fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. We also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into income over the life of the loan. Fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies are generally non-recurring and are recognized as revenue when services are provided. In certain instances where the Company is invited to participate as a co-lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment, all or a portion of any loan fees received by the Company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the investment s life using the effective yield method.  
     
   Expenses   
     
  Our primary operating expenses include the payment of Management fees and Incentive fees to the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement with our Administrator (the  Administration Agreement ), operating costs associated with our sub-administration, custodian and transfer agent agreements with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the  Sub-Administration Agreements ) and other operating costs described below. The Management and Incentive fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:  
     
                        allocated organization costs from the Advisor incurred prior to the commencement of our operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million; 
     
                        the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 
     
 40   

Table of Contents   
     
                        fidelity bond, directors  and officers  liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 
     
                        direct costs, such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 
     
                        fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 
     
                        independent directors  fees and expenses; 
     
                        U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 
     
                        the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 
     
                        fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; 
     
                        out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
     
                        federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; 
     
                        brokerage commissions; 
     
                        costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; 
     
                        debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and 
     
                        all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. 
     
  We have agreed to repay the Advisor for initial organization costs and equity offering costs incurred prior to the commencement of operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million on a pro rata basis over the first $350 million of invested capital not to exceed 3 years from the initial capital commitment. The Advisor is responsible for organization and private equity offerings costs in excess of $1.5 million.  
     
  We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive Fees and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be incremental.  
     
   Leverage   
     
  Our financing facilities allows us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as  leverage  and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders.  
     
  The use of leverage involves significant risks. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we will only be permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 2 to 1 after such borrowing. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our Advisor s and our Board assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.  
     
   PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ACTIVITY   
     
  We seek to create a diverse portfolio that generally includes senior secured first-lien,  unitranche  (which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position), senior secured second lien and subordinated loans and minority equity securities by investing in the securities of U.S. middle market companies. The size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.

  The following table presents certain selected information regarding our investment portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The following table shows the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

(1)            Includes unfunded commitments at cost of $6.8 million and $2.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
     
  Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.  
     
  The Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Advisor monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Advisor has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:  
     
        assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
     
        review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
     
        contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
     
        comparisons to other companies in the industry; and 
     
        possible attendance at, and participation in, board meetings. 
     
  As part of the monitoring process, the Advisor regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:  
     
 43   

Table of Contents   
     
  1    Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment/borrower is performing above expectations since investment, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the financial performance of the borrower or a potential exit.  
     
  2     Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of investment. The investment/borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.  
     
  3     Involves an investment/borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the investment s risk has increased somewhat since investment. The borrower s loan payments are generally not past due and more likely than not the borrower will remain in compliance with debt covenants. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring.  
     
  4     Involves an investment/borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since investment. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Placing loans on non-accrual status should be considered for investments rated 4.  
     
  5     Involves an investment/borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has substantially increased since investment. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and the fair market value of the loan should be reduced to the anticipated recovery amount. Loans with an investment rating of 5 should be placed on non-accrual status.  
     
  The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

   Interest and credit facility expenses   
     
  Interest and credit facility expenses include interest, amortization of deferred financing costs, upfront commitment fees and unused fees on the Revolving Credit Facility and SPV Asset Facility. The Company first drew on the Revolving Credit Facility in July 2015 and first drew on the SPV Asset Facility in April 2016. Interest and credit facility expenses increased from $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $26.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $85.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Average interest rate (excludes deferred upfront financing costs and unused fees) on our weighted average debt outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively.  
     
  Interest and credit facility expenses increased from $0.3 million for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015 to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $9.0 million for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015 to $74.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Average interest rate (excludes deferred upfront financing costs and unused fees) on our weighted average debt outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015 were 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively.  
     
   Management fees   
     
  Management fees will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The Advisor, however, has agreed to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of the sum of (i) 0.25% of the aggregate committed but undrawn capital and (ii) 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents (including capital drawn to pay the Company s expenses) during any period prior to a qualified initial public offering, as defined by the Investment Advisory Agreement ( Qualified IPO ). Management fees, net of waived management fees, increased from $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the increase in total assets, which increased from an average of $83.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to an average of $199.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Waived management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were approximately $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Advisor will not be permitted to recoup any waived amounts at any time.

   Income incentive fees   
     
  Income incentive fees increased from zero for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below), expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets as of the preceding quarter, exceeding 1.5% per quarter (the hurdle rate). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, income incentive fees as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income was 3.7% compared to 0.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income incentive fees as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income was 1.7% compared to 0.0% for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015.  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the base management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement and any interest expense, but excluding the Incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes accrued income that we have not yet received in cash, such as debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities.  
     
   Professional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  Professional fees generally include expenses from independent auditors, tax advisors, legal counsel and third party valuation agents. Other general and administrative expenses generally include expenses from the Sub-Administration Agreements, insurance premiums, overhead and staffing costs allocated from the Administrator and other miscellaneous general and administrative costs associated with the operations and investment activity of the Company. Professional fees increased from $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, while other general and administrative expenses increased from $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, both due to an increase in costs associated with servicing a growing investment portfolio.  
     
  Professional fees increased from $0.1 million for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015 to $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, while other general and administrative expenses increased from $0.3 million for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015  to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, both due to an increase in costs associated with servicing a growing investment portfolio.  
     
   Organization expenses   
     
  We have agreed to repay the Advisor for the organization costs and offering costs (not to exceed $1.5 million) on a pro rata basis over the first $350 million of capital contributed to the Company.

  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Advisor also allocated $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of equity offering costs to the Company that was recorded as an offset to Paid-in capital in excess of par value on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  
     
   During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015, we called $42.0 million and $69.0 million, respectively, and the Advisor allocated $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of organization costs to the Company, which was included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

   Income Tax Expense, Including Excise Tax   
     
  We have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must generally (among other requirements) timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. In order to maintain our RIC status, we intend to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders which will generally relieve us from corporate-level income taxes.  
     
  In order for the Company not to be subject to federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (ii) 98.2% of its net capital gains from the current year and (iii) any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. As of September 30, 2016, we had no accrual for U.S. federal excise tax.  
     
   Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses   
     
  We value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:

   Hedging   
     
  We may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks.  Generally, we do not intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to the Company s business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which will be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may include the use of various instruments, including futures, options and forward contracts. We will bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.  
     
  We did not enter into any interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and for the period from February 5, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015.  
     
   FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
  At September 30, 2016, we had $5.9 million in cash on hand. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; (2) the cost of operations (including paying our Advisor); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and, (4) cash distributions to the holders of our common shares.  
     
  We expect to generate additional cash from (1) future offerings of our common or preferred shares; (2) borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility, SPV Asset Facility and from other banks or lenders; and, (3) cash flows from operations.  
     
  Cash on hand of $5.9 million combined with our uncalled capital commitments of $92.1 million, $2.2 million undrawn amount on our Revolving Credit Facility and $18.3 million undrawn amount on our SPV Asset Facility, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations for the foreseeable future.  
     
    Capital Share Activity    
     
  Since June 26, 2015 (Commencement), we have entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the  Subscription Agreements ) with several investors, including CCG LP, providing for the private placement of our common shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our common shares up to the amount of their respective capital commitments on an as-needed basis with a minimum of 10 business days  prior notice. At September 30, 2016, we had received capital commitments totaling $211.1 million, of which $10.0 million was from CCG LP.  
     
  Since June 26, 2015 (Commencement), pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, we have delivered seven capital drawdown notices to our investors relating to the issuance of 6,022,018 of our common shares for an aggregate offering of $119.0 million. Proceeds from the issuance were used to commence our investing activities and for other general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2016, the Company received all amounts relating to the September 16, 2016 capital drawdown notice.  
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 468.90 and 1274.03 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have opted into our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $9,014 and $24,701, respectively.

    Debt    
     
  Debt consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(1)       
 
  The amount available reflects any limitations related to the   respective debt facilities  borrowing bases.           

(2)       
 
  The Company had outstanding debt denominated in Pound Sterling (GBP)   of 2.5 million and 1.5 million on its Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.           

(3)       
 
  The Company had outstanding debt denominated in Euro (EUR) of 1.8   million on its Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016.              
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.  
     
   Revolving Credit Facility   
     
  On June 29, 2015, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with Natixis, New York Branch ( Natixis ) as administrative agent (the  Administrative Agent ), and Natixis and certain of its affiliates as lenders. Proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for investment activities, expenses, working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. The maximum principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is $50 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. On October 23, 2015, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility to include a multi-currency tranche allowing the Company to borrow up to 15% of the principal amount committed under an alternative currency including Euro, Canadian Dollar and Pound Sterling (GBP). On June 29, 2016, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility decreasing the facility limit from $75 million to $50 million and extending the maturity date to June 29, 2017.  
     
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either (i) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin with no LIBOR floor or (ii) at lenders  cost of funds plus a margin. The Company may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of draw-down, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The Company pays unused facility fees of 0.20% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on June 29, 2017.  
     
   SPV Asset Facility   
     
  On March 28, 2016 Crescent Capital BDC Funding, LLC ( CBDC SPV ), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Company, entered into a loan and security agreement (the  SPV Asset Facility ) with the Company as the collateral manager, seller and equityholder, CBDC SPV as the borrower, the banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender. The SPV Asset Facility is effective as of March 28, 2016.  
     
 50   

Table of Contents   
     
  The maximum commitment amount under the SPV Asset Facility is $75,000,000, and may be increased with the consent of Wells Fargo or reduced upon request of the Company. Proceeds of the Advances under the SPV Asset Facility may be used to acquire portfolio investments, to make distributions to the Company in accordance with the SPV Asset Facility, and to pay related expenses. The maturity date is the earlier of: (a) the date the borrower voluntarily reduces the commitments to zero, (b) the Facility Maturity Date (March 28, 2021) and (c) the date upon which Wells Fargo declares the obligations due and payable after the occurrence of an Event of Default. Borrowings under the SPV Asset Facility bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin with no LIBOR floor. The Company pays unused facility fees of 0.50% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the SPV Asset Facility. The SPV Asset Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature.  
     
  Also on March 28, 2016, the Company, as seller, and CBDC SPV, as purchaser, entered into a loan sale agreement whereby the Company will sell certain assets to CBDC SPV. We consolidate CBDC SPV in our consolidated financial statements and no gain or loss is expected to result from the sale of assets to CBDC SPV. We retain a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by CBDC SPV through our 100% ownership of CBDC SPV. The facility size is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the amount of CBDC SPV s assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test and certain concentration limits.  

(1)  The Company was formed on February 5, 2015 and commenced operations on June 26, 2015.  
     
  To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to our Revolving Credit Facility and SPV Asset Facility. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. In accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, as a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 2 to 1 after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our asset coverage ratio was 2.25 to 1 and 2.42 to 1, respectively. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. See Note 6. Debt to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the debt facilities.  
     
   OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 25, 2016, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC.  
     
  In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Investment Valuation   
     
  The Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820,  Fair Value Measurement  (ASC 820), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in the determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:  
     
  Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.  
     
  Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.  
     
  Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  
     
  In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company applies the valuation policy approved by its Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Company subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for classification as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, the Company reviews pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfers occur. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $17,000,233 in transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in observable inputs in market data.  
     
  Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Advisor, the Company s Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.  
     
 52   

Table of Contents   
     
  The Board oversees and supervises a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:  
     
                  The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. 
     
                  The Advisor s management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. 
     
                  The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. 
     
                  The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Advisor, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties. 
     
  The Company currently conducts this valuation process on a quarterly basis.  
     
  In connection with debt and equity securities that are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board, the Board will engage independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified.  
     
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.  
     
  In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. See Note 4. Investments and Note 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional information on the Company s investment portfolio.  
     
   Equity Offering and Organization Expenses   
     
  The Company has agreed to repay the Advisor for initial organization costs and equity offering costs incurred prior to the commencement of its operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million on a pro rata basis over the first $350 million of invested capital not to exceed 3 years from the initial capital commitment on June 26, 2015. To the extent such costs relate to equity offerings, these costs are charged as a reduction of capital upon the issuance of common shares. To the extent such costs relate to organization costs, these costs are expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon the issuance of common shares. The Advisor is responsible for organization and private equity offerings costs in excess of $1.5 million.  
     
  The Advisor incurred costs on behalf of the Company of $794,450 of equity offering costs and $567,895 of organization costs through Commencement. For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Advisor allocated to the Company $27,238 of equity offering costs and $19,471 of organization costs, of which $46,709 was included in Due to Advisor on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities at September 30, 2016. Since June 26, 2015 (Commencement), the Advisor has allocated to the Company $270,113 of equity offering costs and $193,084 of organization costs.  
     
   Interest and Dividend Income Recognition   
     
   Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted or amortized into interest income over the    contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums, if any. 
     
 53   

Table of Contents   
     
  Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.  
     
  Certain investments have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal or cost basis of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Accrued PIK interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively, when an investment is placed on non-accrual status.  
     
  Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no loans had been placed on non-accrual status by the Company.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  The Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company s stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  
     
  The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, all tax filings of the Company since the inception on February 5, 2015 remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities. No such examinations are currently pending.  
     
  In order for the Company not to be subject to federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (ii) 98.2% of its net capital gains from the current year and (iii) any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required.

   CBDC Universal Equity, Inc. has elected to be a taxable entity (the  Taxable Subsidiary ). The Taxable Subsidiary permits the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are  pass through  entities for tax purposes    and continue to comply with the  source income  requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
     
  The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes is required in the consolidated financial statements.  
     
   New Accounting Standards   
     
  In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014 15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205   40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .  ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02: Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  that amends the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. The changes are extensive and apply to all companies. The need to assess an entity under a different consolidation model may change previous consolidation conclusions. This ASU is effective for public reporting entities in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 for nonpublic business entities. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of  ASU 2015-02, if any.

   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     
     
  We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.  
     
   Valuation Risk   
     
  We have invested, and plan to continue to invest,  in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. These investments will generally not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Account Policies to our consolidated financial statements for more details on estimates and judgments made by us in connection with the valuation of our investments.  
     
   Interest Rate Risk   
     
  Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We also fund a portion of our investments with borrowings and our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.  
     
  We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate-sensitive assets to our interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, 87.2% of the investments at fair value in our portfolio were at variable rates, subject to interest rate floors. The Revolving Credit Facility and SPV Asset Faiclity also bear interest at variable rates.  
     
  Assuming that our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments):  
     
  ($ in millions)  

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.  
     
  We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.  
     
 56   

Table of Contents   
     
   Currency Risk   
     
  From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are converted into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our Revolving Credit Facility. Instead of entering into a foreign exchange forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. As of September 30, 2016, we had  2.5 million and  1.8 million outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility as a natural hedge against a  3.0 million investment and  1.8 million investment, respectively.  
     
   Item 4.                               Controls and Procedures    
     
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
     
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
