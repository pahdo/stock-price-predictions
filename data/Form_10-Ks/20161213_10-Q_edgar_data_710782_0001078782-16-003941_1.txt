 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
 (A) 
 The condensed balance sheet at April 30, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The interim condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission from the accounts of Arbor Entech Corporation (the  Company ) without audit; however, in the opinion of management, the information presented reflects all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which are necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. It is recommended that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s fiscal year 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed In July 2016 and other financial reports filed by the Company from time to time. 
   
 (B) 
 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

ARBOR ENTECH CORPORATION  
   
  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 This report may contain  forward looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (including any statements regarding the Company s outlook for fiscal 2017 and beyond). Any forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include, among other risks and uncertainties, without limitation, the lack of any current business operation, the possible failure to identify a suitable acquisition candidate, and specific risks which may be associated with any new business or acquisition that we may acquire. 
   
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  may,   will,   should,   could,   would,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   projects,   predicts,   potential  and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except as otherwise required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in this report to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any of our forward-looking statements are based. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  
   
 The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued disclosure guidance for  critical accounting policies.  The SEC defines  critical accounting policies  as those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. 
   
 Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to these financial statements. Currently, based on the Company s limited activity, we do not believe that there are any accounting policies that require the application of difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 
   
  Historical Background  
   
 Historically, we were a wood products company that had been in business since 1980. Our business fluctuated over the years. We were almost wholly dependent on sales to The Home Depot, Inc. As discussed below in  Discontinued Operations,  on September 2, 2003, we discontinued our wood products business. 
   
 We previously disclosed that we were in discussions with respect to a potential acquisition of an early stage, privately-held pre-revenue web portal company. These discussions are no longer ongoing. Currently, we are seeking other business opportunities, but there can be no assurance that such opportunities will be identified, capitalized upon, or result in any profits. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 Since we discontinued our wood products business in 2003, we have had no sales revenue, including during the three months and six months ended October 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4,385 for the quarter ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $4,015 for the comparable prior period. For the six months ended October 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $13,070 as compared to $12,657 for the comparable prior period. The changes in operating expenses were primarily due to changes in filing and professional fees. 
   
 For the quarter ended October 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $4,325 compared to a net loss of $3,950 for the comparable prior period. For the six months ended October 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $12,948, compared to a net loss of $12,526, for the comparable prior period. The changes in net loss were primarily due to changes in professional fees. 

7 

Discontinued Operations  
   
 On September 2, 2003, we terminated our business relationship with Home Depot due to increased difficulties in transacting business with such company on a profitable basis. These difficulties included Home Depot s prohibition against price increases, despite increases in our costs of production, a diminution in the Home Depot territories to which we were allowed to sell product, and Home Depot s demands regarding returns of ordered products that we were unwilling to accede to for economic reasons. The sale of our real estate resulted in a gain of approximately $186,000 for the year ended April 30, 2005. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 At October 31, 2016, we had working capital of $231,526, compared to working capital of $244,474 at April 30, 2016. 
   
 As of October 31, 2016 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $236,526, a decrease of $10,898 compared with our cash on hand at April 30, 2016.  
   
 Operating activities used $10,898 in cash for the six months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $12,526 used during the comparable prior period. 
   
 Since terminating our wood products business in September 2003, due to limited cash resources and a limited and sporadic trading market for our Common Stock, among other reasons, we have been unable to find a suitable business opportunity or merger candidate. Nevertheless, we continue to seek business opportunities, including potential acquisition candidates.   
   
 During the remainder of fiscal 2017, we do not anticipate that we will incur any capital expenditures. 
   
 We anticipate that our operating activities will generate negative net cash flow during the balance of fiscal 2017. We believe that the cash on hand will be sufficient for meeting our liquidity and capital resource needs for the next year. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Transactions  
   
 We do not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 This Item is not applicable because we are a  smaller reporting company,  as defined by applicable SEC regulation. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures . We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes or additions to our controls and procedures. 
   
 As of October 31, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our President/Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings within the required time period. 
   
  Changes in Internal control Over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
