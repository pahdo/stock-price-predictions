General   

1.
Basis of Presentation  

The condensed unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( GAAP ), for interim information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual fiscal reporting periods. However, in the opinion of management, all
adjustments consisting of normal, recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position
and results of operations have been included and management believes the disclosures that are made are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. 

The results of operations for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying condensed unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the 2015 audited financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Form 10-K ). 

2.
Presentation of Financial Statements  

The condensed unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements included herein include the accounts of Medifast, Inc. (the  Company ) and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

3.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

We have considered all new
accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on our results
of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information, except for: 

ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payable Accounting  allows for the simplification of accounting
for stock compensation in relation to income taxes, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the
statement of cash flows. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The pronouncement
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic
842)  requires the rights and obligations of all leased assets with a term greater than 12 months to be presented on the balance
sheet. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the
effect that the pronouncements of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s financial statements. 

ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-
Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , most notably requires
the changes in fair value of equity investments to be recognized in net income. The pronouncement also requires the use of the
exit price notion, the separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of asset, and
the separate presentation in other comprehensive income of changes in fair value resulting from a change in the instrument-specific
credit risk. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Based on the risk level of the
Company s investment portfolio, Management does not expect the pronouncement to have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements. 

ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes
(Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  requires the Company to classify all deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities as noncurrent. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The pronouncement
will result in a reclassification on the condensed consolidated balance sheet but is not expected to have any other material impacts
on the Company s financial statements. 

ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic
330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , requires the Company to recognize inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016. The pronouncement
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

ASU 2015-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , requires the Company to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers
for the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company will be required to
identify the contract, identify the relevant performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize the revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The pronouncements of this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is still
evaluating the effect that the pronouncements of ASU 2015-09 will have on the Company s financial statements but does not
expect it to have a material impact. 

4.
Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is recognized net of
discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, and estimated returns and upon transfer of title and risk to the
customer which primarily occurs at shipping (F.O.B. terms). Upon shipment, the Company has no further performance obligations
and collection is reasonably assured as the majority of sales are paid for prior to shipping. Revenue from our Franchise Medifast
Weight Control Centers is primarily generated from product sales. 

5.
Inventories  

Inventories consist principally
of packaged meal replacements held in the Company s warehouses. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, utilizing
the first-in, first-out method. The cost of finished goods includes the cost of raw materials, packaging supplies, direct and
indirect labor and other indirect manufacturing costs. On a quarterly basis, management reviews inventory for unsalable or obsolete
inventory. 

Inventories consisted of the
following as of: 

6.
Earnings per Share  

Basic earnings per share ( EPS )
computations are calculated utilizing the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented.
Diluted EPS is calculated utilizing the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effect
of dilutive common stock equivalents. 

The following table sets forth
the computation of basic and diluted EPS: 

The calculation of diluted
earnings per share excluded 10,000 and 69,375 antidilutive options outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and 87,500 and 74,373 antidilutive options outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. EPS is computed independently for each of the quarters presented; accordingly, the sum of the quarterly earnings
per common share may not equal the year-to-date total computed. 

7.
Estimates  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

8.
Financial Instruments  

Certain financial assets and
liabilities are accounted for at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value: 

Level 1   Quoted prices
are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which
transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
basis. 

Level 2   Pricing inputs
are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. 

Level 3   Pricing inputs
include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally
developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant. 

The following table represents
cash and the available-for-sale securities adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant
investment category recorded as cash and cash equivalents or investment securities as of: 

The Company had a realized
loss of $97 thousand and $17 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a realized loss
of $174 thousand and a realized gain of $117 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position
for 12 months or longer were not significant. The maturities of the Company s investment securities generally range up to
5 years for municipal bonds and for government and agency securities. 

9.
Shared-based Compensation   

Stock Options: 

The Company has issued non-qualified
and incentive stock options to employees and nonemployee directors. The fair value of these options are estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires estimates of the expected term of the option, the expected
volatility of the price of the Company s common stock, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate. Options outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 generally vest over a period of three years with an expiration term of ten years. The exercise price
of these options ranges from $24.26 to $31.55. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s
common stock over the period of time equivalent to the expected term for each award. Due to the Company s lack of option
exercise history, the expected term is calculated using the simplified method defined as the midpoint between the vesting period
and the contractual term of each award. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the
date of grant which most closely corresponds to the expected term of the option. The Company declared its first dividend in December
2015; and therefore, a dividend yield was not utilized in the Black-Scholes calculation for options granted prior to December
2015. The weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values were as follows: 

The following table summarizes the stock option
activity: 

The weighted-average grant
date fair value of options granted as of September 30, 2016 was $7.91. The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under
the fair value method for shares expected to vest as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $0.6 million and is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. No cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were received during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company received $0.3 million and $44 thousand in cash proceeds from the
exercise of stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Restricted Stock: 

The Company has issued restricted
stock to employees and nonemployee directors generally with vesting terms up to five years after the date of grant. The fair value
is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. Expense for restricted stock is amortized
ratably over the vesting period. The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity: 

The total costs of the options
and restricted stock awards charged against income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $678 thousand
and $602 thousand, respectively, and $1.9 million and $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company accrued an additional $248 thousand and $156 thousand for performance-based restricted stock awards for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $613 thousand and $634 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cost of the 2016 performance awards will depend on management s achievement of pre-determined
performance targets and the Company s fiscal 2016 performance and will be finalized and approved at the first Board of Directors
meeting in 2017. The cost recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is based on the performance that management
expects the Company will achieve as of September 30, 2016. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements
of income for restricted stock awards was approximately $228 thousand and $212 thousand for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively and $622 thousand and $602 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The total
tax benefit recognized in additional paid-in capital upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of stock options for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $5 thousand, and $105 thousand and $170 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No tax benefit was recognized in additional paid-in capital upon vesting of restricted stock
awards and exercise of stock options for the three months ended September 30, 2016. There was approximately $2.5 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards as of September 30, 2016. The cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years, respectively. 

On October 3, 2016, the Company
granted an award for an additional 16,061 of time-based restricted shares and 210,000 deferred shares that vest based on certain
market and performance conditions to an executive. The cost of the award is $2.6 million and will be recognized through December
2019.

Business Segments  

Operating
segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by
the chief operating decision maker about how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The consolidated operating profit
of the Company is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker as a single segment and sales are reviewed at the business unit
level.

11. Discontinued Operations, Exit Activities, and Clinic Obligations 

In 2014, the Company exited the Medifast Weight
Control corporate center model by selling 41 company owned centers to existing franchise partners (24 centers were sold in June
2014 and the remaining 17 centers were sold in December 2014) and closure of the remaining 34 corporate centers. In accordance
with ASU 2014-08,  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting
Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  the assets, liabilities, operating results,
and cash flows of the corporate Medifast Weight Control Center business unit have been presented separately as discontinued operations
in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. 

The following is a summary of the Company s
operating results for discontinued operations for the:

12. Restructuring 

During the first quarter of
2016, the Company announced the departure of three Executive Vice Presidents in an effort to re-align the senior leadership team
to reflect the changing needs of the business and to provide greater emphasis on the Company s key areas of focus, and also
the resignation of the Company s President and Chief Operating Officer. The Company incurred $1.2 million in net restructuring
costs in selling, general, and administrative expense associated with the departure of these four executives. This includes a
$0.2 million reversal of costs accrued in 2015 for deferred shares that were granted in connection with the 2015 bonus plan and
were forfeited as a result of their departure. 

The following table summarizes
the severance accruals incurred as of September 30, 2016, excluding the reversal of prior year stock accrual: 

13. Impairment 

During the second quarter of
2016, the Company incurred a $6.1 million impairment charge in connection with the abandonment of software under development for
the Take Shape For Life  business unit. The decision to abandon the software, which was determined in the final stages of
the quarterly close process, was the result of an in depth analysis of proven alternatives available today in the market which
are a better fit for our business going forward and the cost of these alternatives when compared to the ongoing development and
maintenance of the abandoned software. The impairment charge was recorded for the full value of the asset and has been included
as part of selling, general, and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

This report contains information that
may constitute  forward-looking statements.  Generally, the words  believe,   expect,   intend, 
 estimate,   anticipate,   project,   will,  and similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments
that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future   including statements relating to future operating results- are forward-looking
statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should
be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date
when made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations
or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the 2015 Form 10-K, and those
described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein.

ended September 30, 2016, total revenue increased to $68.6 million compared to $65.9 million in the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $2.7 million or 4.1%. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenue increased to $212.1
million compared to $211.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.6 million or 0.3%. The increase
for the periods was driven by a revenue increase in the Take Shape For Life  business unit, which was the result of a price
increase for the Take Shape For Life business unit which became effective in April 2016, and an increase in the number of active
Health Coaches and revenue per Health Coach. The improvements were partially offset by reduced revenues in the Medifast Direct,
Medifast Wholesale, and MWCC business units for the quarter as well as year to date, despite price increases in the Medifast Direct
and Medifast Wholesale business units, which became effective in April 2016. These revenue changes are further described in the
 Overview of Results of Operations  section.  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the percentage of total revenue made up by each business unit was as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial
statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting estimates we consider critical include revenue recognition,
impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets, income taxes, reserves for returns, operating leases and clinic closure costs. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we did not make any material changes to our critical accounting policies. 

Overview of Results of Operations (tabular
in thousands)  

Revenue: Revenue increased approximately
4.1% to approximately $68.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $65.9 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The revenue to total advertising spend for the three months ended September 30, 2016
was 37.2-to-1 compared to 25.5-to-1 for the same period of 2015. Revenue increased approximately 0.3% to approximately $212.1
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $211.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The revenue to total advertising spend for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 27.9-to-1 compared to 16.7-to-1
for the same period of 2015. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, Take Shape For Life  revenue increased to $56.5 million compared to $49.9 million in the same period in 2015. This is
the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for this business unit. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, Take Shape For Life  revenue increased to $170.6 million compared to $154.2 million in the same period in 2015. The
increase in revenue for Take Shape For Life  was driven by an increase in the number of active Health Coaches and revenue
per Health Coach, as well as the pass-through of the price increase put in place effective April 2016. The number of active Health
Coaches for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 12,800 compared with 12,000 during the same period for 2015,
an increase of 7%. The quarterly revenue per Health Coach increased 7% to $4,421 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $4,145 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Medifast Direct revenue decreased 28%
to $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.2 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015 and decreased 28% to $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $39.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Revenues in this business unit are driven primarily by targeted customer marketing and advertising as
well as the direct response initiatives in place. Sales for the period were down in comparison to the same period for 2015 as
new customer acquisition continued to be challenging, partially offset by a price increase effective April 2016. Medifast Direct
advertising during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was down 26% to $1.7 million compared to $2.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Medifast Direct advertising during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was down 37% to $7.4
million compared to $11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company reduced advertising spending and only
invested in initiatives that met distinct criteria in an effort to focus on determining the ideal media mix to optimize profitability. 

MWCC revenue decreased 8%, with revenue
of $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.0 million for the same period of 2015 and decreased
10% with revenue of $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13.4 million for the same period of
2015. Fifty-five franchise centers and one authorized reseller location were in operation as of September 30, 2016 compared to
62 franchise centers as of September 30, 2015. The decrease in franchise centers over the 12 month period was the result of six
centers closing and one center transitioning to the authorized reseller model. The decrease in revenue for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by fewer
franchise centers in operation during the period and a decrease in same store sales. 

Medifast Wholesale revenue decreased $0.5
million to $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015 and decreased $3.4 million to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the periods was due to the loss of certain accounts resulting from
Medifast s enforcement of business partner compliance distribution requirements. 

Costs of Sales: Cost of sales decreased
$0.4 million to $16.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.8 million for the same period in 2015
and decreased $1.9 million to $53.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $55.4 million for the same
period in 2015. The decrease in cost of sales for the 2016 periods was primarily driven by reduced shipping costs. As a percentage
of sales, gross margin increased to 76.1% from 74.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015, and increased to 74.8% from 73.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The gross margin improvements for the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods were primarily driven
by the price increases implemented in March 2015 and April 2016. Also impacting margin was the improved shipping costs currently
being realized. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $43.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of
$2.0 million, compared to $41.2 million in the same period of 2015. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased to 63.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 62.5% for the same period of 2015. Take
Shape For Life  commission expense, which is variable based upon product sales, increased by approximately $3.0 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015, which is in line with the sales growth of 13%
Take Shape For Life  experienced compared to the same period of the prior year. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $138.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $132.9 million for the same period of 2015. As a
percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 65.2% compared to 62.9% in the same period of 2015.
The Company incurred $6.1 million in asset impairment costs and $1.2 million in restructuring costs in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and $2.1 million in extraordinary legal and advisory expenses related to 13D filings in the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Excluding those expenses, selling, general, and administrative costs would have been $131.1 million, or 61.8%, and $130.8
million, or 61.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Take Shape For Life  commission expense,
which is variable based upon product sales, increased by approximately $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015, which is in line with the sales growth of 11% Take Shape For Life  experienced compared
to the prior year. 

Salaries and benefits were consistent
year over year for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Salaries and
benefits decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in
2015. The decrease in expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily driven by savings recognized as a result
of the restructuring that took place during the first quarter of 2016. The restructuring savings recognized in the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by recruiting fees incurred in connection with the hiring of the
Company s new Chief Executive Officer who joined the Company in October 2016 and an increase in stock compensation costs. 

During the first quarter of 2016, the
Company announced the departure of three Executive Vice Presidents in an effort to re-align the Senior Leadership Team to reflect
the changing needs of the business and to provide greater emphasis on the Company s key areas of focus, and also the resignation
of the President and Chief Operating Officer. The Company incurred $1.2 million in net restructuring costs in selling, general,
and administrative expense associated with the separation agreements for these four executives. This includes a $0.2 million reversal
of costs accrued in 2015 for deferred shares that were granted to these three executives in connection with the 2015 bonus plan
and were forfeited as a result of their departure. All expenses are expected to be paid within 12 months and the Company estimates
that it will recognize $2.2 million in future annual savings as a result of the restructuring. 

The following
table summarizes the severance accruals incurred as of September 30, 2016, excluding the reversal of prior year stock accrual: 

Sales and marketing expense decreased
by $0.8 million and $4.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2015. The $0.8 million decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by reduced
advertising spend, particularly for Medifast Direct. The $4.8 million decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to 2015 was primarily driven by reduced advertising spending, reduced production costs associated with the Company s 2016
television commercial as compared to 2015 production costs, and was partially offset by increases in research and development
costs and promotional materials purchased. 

General expenses decreased $0.3 million
and $2.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, in comparison to the same periods in 2015. The
decrease in expense for was primarily driven by a decrease in legal fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to 2015, the decrease in legal fees was primarily attributable to the extraordinary expenses resulting from 13D filings incurred
during the 2015 period related to Engaged Capital, LLC., a stockholder of the Company. The Company reached a settlement agreement
with Engaged Capital, LLC. during the first quarter of 2015 and no additional expenses have been incurred. The significant decrease
in legal fees was partially offset by an increase in consulting expenses. Other expenses decreased by $0.4 million and increased
by $5.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, respectively. The significant increase
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by the $6.1 million impairment for the abandonment of the Take Shape For
Life  software that was under development during the period. The Company benefited from reduced depreciation expense in both
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. 

Income taxes:   In the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded $2.9 million in income tax expense, an effective rate of 32.7%, compared to $2.7 million in income
tax expense, an effective rate of 33.4%, in the three months ended September 30, 2015. In the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded $6.7 million in income tax expense, an effective rate of 32.9%, compared to $8.1 million in income
tax expense, an effective rate of 34.0%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was due to the increase in
the effective state tax rate offset by the increase in the research and development credit. The decrease in the effective tax
rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to the increase
in domestic manufacturing deduction and the  change in the tax law making certain research and development credits. The Company
anticipates a full year tax rate of approximately 33 to 34% in 2016. 

Income from continuing operations: Income
from continuing operations was $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.4 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.7 million. Pre-tax profit as a percentage of sales increased to 13.1% in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 12.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Income from continuing operations
was $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of $2.0 million. Pre-tax profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.6% in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 11.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the asset impairment, restructuring charges,
and extraordinary legal expenses, income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 would
have been $18.6 million and $17.0 million, respectively. 

Income from discontinued operations: In
2014, the Company exited the MWCC corporate center model with the sale of 41 centers to existing franchise partners and the closure
of the remaining 34 corporate centers. The Company had negligible income from discontinued operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net income: Net income was $6.1 million
and $13.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $5.5 million and $16.2 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The year-over-year changes were driven by the factors described
above in the explanations from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to providing results that
are determined in accordance with GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company did not incur any
non-GAAP adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company s non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share
exclude the impairment of the fixed asset incurred in the second quarter of 2016 and the restructuring charges incurred in the
first quarter of 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted
income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the extraordinary legal and advisory expenses
incurred in connection with the Schedule 13D filings. These non-GAAP measures are being provided as pro-forma statements to provide
information regarding expected future performance. The departed executives included in the restructuring were employed in 2015;
and therefore, the 2016 results excluding these charges are not comparative to the 2015 results. 

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures are as follows: 

(1) The tax effected
impact of adjustments is calculated utilizing the effective tax rate for the period presented, which may differ for quarterly
and year-to-date periods. 

(2) The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in
the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation
of the reported per share amounts. 

Excluding the impact of the $6.1 million
impairment charge and $1.2 million restructuring charge, adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses was $131.1 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the impact of the $2.1 million extraordinary legal expenses incurred in
connection with the Schedule 13D filings, adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses was $130.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted income from operations was $27.5 million and $25.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $18.6 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $17.0 million, or $1.41 per share for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The three months ended September 30, 2015 included an insignificant adjustment associated with the extraordinary legal
expenses incurred in connection with the Schedule 13D filings that did not impact the reported results. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company had stockholders  equity
of $94.9 million and working capital of $77.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared with $88.6 million and $64.5 million at December
31, 2015, respectively. The $6.3 million net increase in stockholder s equity reflects $13.7 million in 2016 net income
offset by $9.0 million used to declare dividends to stockholders as well as other equity transactions as outlined in the  Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders  Equity  included in our consolidated financial statements. A dividend
of $0.25 per share to the Company s common stockholders was declared on September 8, 2016 and will be paid in the fourth
quarter of 2016. While we intend to continue the dividend program and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can
provide no assurance we will be able to continue the declaration and payment of dividends. The Company s cash and cash equivalents
position increased from $42.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $57.1 million at September 30, 2016. 

In the nine months ended September 30,
2016 the Company generated cash flow of $26.1 million from continuing operations, partially attributable to $13.7 million in income
from continuing operations. Cash provided by operating activities of $17.4 million primarily includes asset impairment of $6.1
million, depreciation and amortization of $4.2 million, a $2.8 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, share-based compensation
of $1.9 million, a $1.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $0.5 million decrease in accounts receivable.
This was offset by cash used by operating activities of deferred income taxes of $3.2 million and a $1.7 million increase in inventory. 

Net cash used in operating activities
from discontinued operations was $0.5 million including a $0.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $0.4
million decrease in accounts receivable. 

In the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $1.2 million, driven by $26.7 million of cash generated
by the sale of investment securities and $0.7 million proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. This was offset by $28.6
million in cash used by investing activities, consisting of $26.6 million for the purchase of investment securities and $2.0 million
for the purchase of property and equipment. 

In the nine months ended September 30,
2016, financing activities from continuing operations used $9.4 million in cash. The Company used $8.9 for cash dividends paid
to stockholders, $0.7 million to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock to cover employee taxes, and $0.2 million
to repay capital leases. Options exercised by executives and directors provided $0.3 million in cash and the Company realized
a $0.1 million cash benefit for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. As of September 30, 2016, there are 847,567
shares of the Company s common stock eligible for repurchase under the repurchase authorization dated September 16, 2014. 

In pursuing its business strategy, the
Company may require additional cash for operating and investing activities. The Company expects future cash requirements, if any,
to be funded from operating cash flow and financing activities. 

The Company evaluates acquisitions from
time to time as presented. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  

Market risk is the potential loss arising
from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and a decline in the stock market. The Company does not
enter into derivatives, foreign exchange transactions or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

The Company is exposed to market risk
related to changes in interest rates and market pricing impacting our investment portfolio. Its current investment policy is to
maintain an investment portfolio consisting of municipal bonds, U.S. money market securities, and high-grade corporate securities,
directly or through managed funds. Its cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in North
America. Its marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and market pricing risk and will fall in value if market
interest rates increase or if market pricing decreases. If market interest rates were to increase and market pricing were to decrease
immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels at September 30, 2016, it estimates that the fair value of its investment portfolio
would decline by an immaterial amount and therefore it would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to
any significant degree by the effect of a change in market conditions on our investments. 

There have been no material changes to
our market risk exposure since December 31, 2015. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

Management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as
of September 30, 2016. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately
and on a timely basis. Based on this evaluation performed in accordance with the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control
  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our management concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective of the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the
period covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting:   

No change in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Part II Other Information   

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

The Company is, from time to time, subject
to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business.  Based upon the Company s experience,
current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect
on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There have been no material changes to
