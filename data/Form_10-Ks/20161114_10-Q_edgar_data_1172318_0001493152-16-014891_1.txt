1.  
      Nature
    of Business and Continuance of Operations   

Asia
Interactive Media Inc. (previously Black Gardenia Corp.), herein  the Company , was incorporated on February 9, 2000
pursuant to the Laws of the State of Nevada, USA. The Company has no primary business operations. The Company was formed for the
purpose of merging with, engaging in a capital stock exchange with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging
in any other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. The Company provides miscellaneous consulting
services, and it is management s opinion that the consulting activities may result in opportunities for the Company through
a possible merger, acquisition or business combination. On March 22, 2007 the Company changed its name to  Asia Interactive
Media Inc.   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) applicable for a going concern which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company has never generated revenues since inception and has never paid
any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. At September 30, 2016,
the Company had a working capital deficiency of $3,942 and has accumulated losses of $640,370 since its inception. The Company
has no commitments or contingencies outstanding as at September 30, 2016. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is
dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing
to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. It is management s plan to seek additional capital
through equity and/or debt financings. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring
adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

2.  
      Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies   

a)  
      Basis
    of Presentation   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management
believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

b)  
      Use
    of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

c)  
      Basic
    and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share   

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260.10.05 which requires presentation of both basic and diluted
earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to
common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted
EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining
the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive
potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Basic equals dilutive due to no outstanding options or warrants.  

d)  
      Comprehensive
    Loss   

ASC
220.10.05,   Reporting Comprehensive Income  , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive
loss and its components in the financial statements. As at September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no items that represent
a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.

2.  
      Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)   

e)  
      Cash
    and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.  

f)  
      Long-Lived
    Assets   

In
accordance with ASC 360.10.05,   Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  , the carrying
value of long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment.
The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair
value.  

g)  
      Financial
    Instruments   

The
fair value of financial instruments, which include cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and due to related party, were
estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Foreign
currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars. The financial risk is the risk to the Company s operations
that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does
not use hedging or derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk.  

h)  
      Income
    Taxes   

Potential
benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted
ASC 740.10.05   Accounting for Income Taxes   as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740.10.05, the Company is
required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. Potential benefits of net operating losses have
not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize
the net operating losses carried forward in future years.  

i)  
      Foreign
    Currency Translation   

The
Company s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated in accordance with ASC 830.10.05   Foreign Currency Translation  , using the
exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions
or balances are included in the determination of income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars.
The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into hedging or derivative instruments to offset the impact
of foreign currency fluctuations.  

j)  
      Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the
impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company s financial
statements upon adoption.  

3.  
      Miscellaneous
    Income   

Miscellaneous
income consists of income generated from consulting activities. Consulting activities include providing business advisory services
and referral services for expansion opportunities in Asia. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $25,000 and
$15,000 was earned, respectively.

4. Common
Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital  

Common
Stock: Authorized: 100,000,000 shares, $0.00001 par value; 6,534,492 shares issued and outstanding  

Share
Repurchase   

On
April 28, 2011, the Company entered into Share Repurchase Agreements with certain stockholders to repurchase a total of 100,000
common shares at a price of $0.50 per share. The repurchased 100,000 common shares were retired from the issued and outstanding
common stock of the Company.  

Donated
Capital   

In
2006, a former officer of the Company advanced funds to the Company to pay for operating costs incurred by it. These funds were
interest free. A balance due of $14,628 was forgiven by the former officer and recorded as donated capital during the period ended
March 31, 2006. Additionally, the Company was indebted for legal fees incurred in the amount of $23,000 which was assumed by the
former officer, and therefore, the Company recognized donated capital of $23,000 during the period ended March 31, 2006.  

5.  
      Subsequent
    Events   

Management
has reviewed events between September 30, 2016 and November 14, 2016 and no significant events were identified.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Overview    

We
are a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 9, 2000. We currently maintain a mailing
address at Level 30, Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Central Hong Kong, China, and our telephone number is 011-852-9836-2643.
We do not have any subsidiaries. Our fiscal year end is December 31. We were formed for the purpose of merging with, engaging
in a capital stock exchange with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar business
combination with one or more operating businesses.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any specific business combination under consideration and we had not identified any prospective
target business, nor had anyone done so on our behalf. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether any proposed business combination
will be feasible at all, or will be feasible on terms acceptable to us, and we have no way of forecasting whether any proposed
business combination will be successfully completed on a timely basis.  

We
believe that the earliest we will begin generating revenues will not be until after the completion of a business combination.
However, even if we successfully complete a business combination, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated business goals,
gain any operating benefits or generate any profits.  

We
are a  shell company  as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 12b-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), since we have only conducted nominal operations
and have nominal assets.  

Results
of Operations    

For
the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue   

We
have not generated any revenue since our inception on February 9, 2000. We do not anticipate that we will earn any revenue during
the current fiscal year or in the foreseeable future, as we do not have any operations and are presently engaged in seeking a
business combination with a target business. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses over the next year, unless we
are able to successfully complete a business combination and develop the business of the target company.  

Other
Income   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated $15,000 in other income, all of which was in the form of consulting income,
whereas we did not generate any other income during the same period in 2015.  

Expenses   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses increased by $4,891 from the same period in 2015, from
$6,854 to $11,745. This increase was largely due to an increase in our consulting and management fees for the period.  

Our
operating expenses consist entirely of general and administrative expenses, which include professional fees, consulting and management
fees, office and sundry expenses, bank charges and interest and foreign exchange costs. Our professional fees consist of accounting,
legal and audit fees. Our office and sundry expenses include communication expenses (internet, fax and telephone), office supplies,
courier fees and postage costs.  

Our
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $3,644 in professional fees, $6,500
in consulting and management fees, $1,393 in office and sundry expenses, $203 in bank charges and interest and $5 in other expenses.
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our general and administrative expenses included $3,721 in professional fees,
$1,444 in consulting and management fees, $1,373 in office and sundry expenses, $201 in bank charges and interest and $115 in
other expenses.  

Net
Income (Loss)   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we generated net income of $3,255, compared to incurring a net loss of $6,854 during
the same period in 2015. The increase in our net income or decrease in our net loss for the period was entirely due to the increase
in our other income, as offset by the increase in our operating expenses, as described above. Our net income/loss per share during
both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.00.  

For
the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Other
Income   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated $25,000 in other income, compared to $15,000 in other income that we generated
during the same period in 2015. All of this income was in the form of consulting income.  

Expenses   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses increased by $4,752 from the same period in 2015, from
$25,050 to $29,082. This increase was also largely due to an increase in our consulting and management fees for the period.  

Our
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $12,608 in professional fees, $12,500
in consulting and management fees, $4,160 in office and sundry expenses and $567 in bank charges and interest, as offset by an
other expense gain of $33. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our general and administrative expenses included $12,318
in professional fees, $7,280 in consulting and management fees, $4,181 in office and sundry expenses, $575 in bank charges and
interest and $696 in other expenses.  

Net
Loss   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred a net loss of $4,802, compared to a net loss of $10,050 during the same period
in 2015. The decrease in our net loss for the period was entirely due to the increase in our other income, as offset by the increase
in our operating expenses, as described above. Our net loss per share during both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $0.00.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of September 30, 2016 we had $7,646 in cash and total assets, $11,588 in current and total liabilities and a working capital deficit
of $3,942. From our inception on February 9, 2000 to September 30, 2016, we raised an aggregate of $598,800 from private placements
of our common stock, which, together with donated capital of $37,628, has funded our accumulated deficit of $640,370.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we spent $5,711 in cash on operating activities, compared to spending $10,908 in cash
on operating activities during the same period in 2015. The bulk of our spending on operating activities during the current period
was attributable to our net loss as described above as adjusted for a $909 increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  

We
did not engage in any investing or financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. Our cash holdings
decreased by $5,711 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, equivalent to our spending on operating activities during
the period.  

We
are currently reviewing businesses in relation to a potential business combination. If we are successful in consummating a business
combination, we will likely incur expenses for personnel and business expansion. In order for us to attract and retain quality
personnel, we anticipate that we will need to offer competitive salaries, issue common stock to consultants and employees and
grant stock options. We estimate that our operating expenses over the next 12 months will be approximately $100,000, all of which
will be general and administrative expenses. This estimate may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business
activities and whether we continue our operations.  

We
are not currently in good short-term financial standing and we do not anticipate that we will earn any revenue in the near future
or generate positive internal operating cash flow until we can complete a business combination. It may take several years for
us to acquire an operating business, develop a business plan and generate revenue. There is no assurance we will achieve profitable
operations following the completion of any business combination.  

As
of September 30, 2016 we had $7,646 in cash. Since we will likely require additional capital to fund the acquisition of an operating
business, we plan to proceed by way of private placements, loans or possibly a direct offering. However, there is no assurance
that we will be able to raise enough capital to meet our future cash requirements.  

Going
Concern    

Our
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis and contain
an additional explanatory paragraph in Note 1 which identifies issues that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have no off balance sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that are material to our stockholders.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, and the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified
in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015, our management concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information was not accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure  

Changes
in Internal Controls    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
