TRUE NATURE HOLDING, INC.  
  Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements  
  (Unaudited)  
  Note 1   Description of Business  
   
 True Nature Holding, Inc. is executing on a business plan to acquire a series of businesses which specialize in compounding pharmacy activities, largely direct to consumers, doctors and veterinary professionals. 
   
 True Nature Holding, Inc. (the  Company ), previously known as Trunity Holdings, Inc., became a publicly-traded company through a reverse merger with Brain Tree International, Inc., a Utah corporation ( BTI ). Trunity Holdings, Inc. was the parent company of the prior educational business, named Trunity, Inc., which was formed on July 28, 2009 through the acquisition of certain intellectual property by its three founders. On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the restructuring and spin-out of the educational business. 
   
  Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  Basis of Presentation  - The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information, with the instructions to Form 10-Q and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position at September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, refer to Note 5 regarding the spin-out of the educational business and related discontinued operations classification pertaining to the fiscal 2015 period. Common stock share and per share amounts in these financial statements have been retroactively adjusted for the effects of a 1 for 101 reverse stock split that occurred in January 2016. 
   
  Use of Estimates -  The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. 
   
  Per Share Data  - Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options and convertible instruments.  
   
 The Company has excluded all common equivalent shares outstanding for warrants, options and convertible instruments to purchase common stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because all such securities are antidilutive for the periods presented. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 142,652 warrants, 1,067,879 options, 135,037 potential shares which may be issued resulting from the provisions of convertible notes, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the Company had 77,640 warrants, 67,483 options, 316,721 potential shares which may be issued resulting from the provisions of convertible notes, respectively. 
   
  Accounts Receivable -  The accounts receivable balance primarily includes amounts due from customers the Company has invoiced or from third-party providers (e.g., insurance companies and governmental agencies), but for which payment has not been received. Accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount and are unsecured and require no collateral. Charges to bad debt are based on both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- Continued  
   
  Inventories -  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company evaluates the carrying value of inventories on a regular basis, based on the price expected to be obtained for products in their respective markets compared with historical cost. In addition, the Company also regularly evaluates its inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence (expiration), taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales or use in production compared to quantities on hand and the remaining shelf life of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients on hand. Write-downs of inventories are considered to be permanent reductions in the cost basis of inventories. 
   
  Property and Equipment, net -  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed generally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of leasehold improvements are amortized either over the life of the improvement or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Significant improvements are capitalized and disposed or replaced property is written off. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the period they are incurred. When items of property or equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is included in earnings. 
   
  Business Combinations -  The Company accounts for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets, estimated contingent consideration payments and pre-acquisition contingencies. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets the Company has acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts; and discount rates utilized in valuation estimates. 
   
 Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Additionally, any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimates of relevant revenue or other targets, will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change. A change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration or the occurrence of events that cause results to differ from our estimates or assumptions could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations or cash flows in the period of the change in the estimate. 
   
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets -  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangibles under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other, which does not permit amortization, but requires the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards -In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This updated guidance supersedes the current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The updated guidance introduces a five-step model to achieve its core principal of the entity recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until December 15, 2017. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. The Company is currently evaluating which transition method it will adopt and the expected impact of the updated guidance, but does not believe the adoption of the updated guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued  
     
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and/or disclosures. 
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which defines management s responsibility to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. This guidance will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. While the Company is still evaluating ASU 2016-02, the Company expects the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and results of operations due to the recognition of the lease rights and obligations as assets and liabilities. The Company does not expect ASU 2016-02 to have a material effect on the Company s cash flows. 
   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which addresses certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Note 3   Recent Developments  
   
 On April 4, 2016 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Cherokee Compounding Pharmacy in Holly Springs, Georgia, and has subsequently determined it is not suitable for the Company at this time, and therefore we have abandoned this transaction. On May 20, 2016 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Innovation Compounding, Inc. ( Innovation ) in Kennesaw, Georgia. The Company incurred $30,000 of expenses related to a fee for a  no-shop  provision, in addition to other customary expenses associated with the due diligence process. Management has determined not to pursue this acquisition further at this time. 
   
 On April 29, 2016, subject to approval by the Georgia Board of Pharmacy, the Company entered into definitive documents to acquire P3 Compounding of Georgia, LLC, ( P3 ). P3 received Georgia Board of Pharmacy approval for the transaction at the end of June 2016 and the transaction closed effective June 30, 2016. We determined after 90 days of operation that its financial needs did not meet the Company s objectives, and it was unlikely to be able to contribute to the financial success of the Company in the near term. On September 30, 2016 we entered into an agreement with the former owners to spin out the operations and most of the liabilities into a newly formed LLC, owned by the former owners.

Note 4   Financial Condition and Going Concern  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of $0 and current liabilities of $1,224,057 and has incurred a loss from operations. True Nature Holding s principal operations is the acquisition of compounding pharmacy companies. The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to execute its business plan. 
   
 As a result of these factors, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuance is dependent on raising capital and generating revenues sufficient to sustain operations. The Company believes that the necessary capital will be raised and has entered into discussions to do so with certain individuals and companies. However, as of the date of these consolidated financial statements, no formal agreement exists. 
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts classified as liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be forced to take any such actions. 
   
  Note 5   Spin-Out and Discontinued Operations  
   
 On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the restructuring and spin-out of its software educational business, resulting in True Nature Holding, Inc. becoming purely focused on acquiring a series of compounding pharmacy businesses, largely direct to consumers, doctors and veterinary professionals. The results of the operations associated with the spin-out company and Trunity Holdings, Inc., qualifies as discontinued operations as of and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015. 
   
 The results of operations associated with discontinued operations were as follows:

Note 5   Spin-Out and Discontinued Operations (continued)  
   
 Our educational business was fully disposed of in December 2015. As a result, there were no assets or liabilities of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2015 or in subsequent periods. 
   
  Note 6 - Acquisition and Subsequent Spin-out  
     
 On April 29, 2016, subject to approval by the Georgia Board of Pharmacy, the Company entered into definitive documents to acquire P3 Compounding of Georgia, LLC, ( P3 ). P3 received Georgia Board of Pharmacy approval for the transaction at the end of June 2016 and the transaction closed effective June 30, 2016. We determined after 90 days of operation that its financial needs did not meet the Company s objectives, and it was unlikely to be able to contribute to the financial success of the Company in the near term. On September 30, 2016 we entered into an agreement with the former owners to  spin-out  the operations and most of the liabilities into a newly formed LLC, owned by the former owners. 
   
 As a result of the acquisition, P3 is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and even through the operations and most of the liabilities have been transferred to a newly formed LLC controlled by the former owners of P3, the Company still owns the subsidiary which held the operations. The acquisition transaction was accounted for as a business combination and recorded as of June 30, 2016. All revenues recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were attributable to the P3 operations. 
   
 The fair value of the consideration paid pertaining to the acquisition of P3 was $851,150. Consideration for the transaction was structured as follows: 

1) 
   An interest-free note for $150,000 with no interest to be paid in full via wire transfer on the maturity date of August 16, 2016.  This note had not been satisfied at the time of the spin-out, and was cancelled in conjunction with the spin-out;  

2) 
   $425,000 convertible note with a term of 12 months and a 6% interest rate, with the first installment due June 1, 2016, and convertible into common stock of True Nature at a rate of $1.25 per share (which is 340,000 shares of common stock), less a short-term financing for $14,350 that the Company provided to Integrity for working capital purposes.  This note was converted into 340,000 shares of restricted common stock on September 23, 2016, and subsequently another 25,000 shares of common stock was added to this conversion in consideration of other expenses. These shares remain the property of the holders.

Note 6 - Acquisition and Subsequent Spin-out (continued)  
     
 The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based on a fair value acquisition price of $851,150 pertaining to the consideration provided. 

The fair value of the transaction and related purchase price allocation was based on a third-party valuation obtained by the Company. 
   
 The Company has transferred all of these assets to the newly formed entity which is controlled by the former owners of P3, and it no longer owns any of these assets. The Company is responsible for payment of the following liabilities associated with the operation of P3: A) an obligation to SunTrust Bank in the amount of $17,000, B) an obligation to a lender who provided a short term loan in the amount of $75,000 and C) various payables to be reimbursed which total approximately $3,000. 
   
  Intangible Assets-Customer Relationships  
   
 In determining the fair value of the intangible assets, the Company considered, among other factors, the best use of the acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance of P3 and estimates of future performance of P3. The fair values of the identified intangible assets related to P3 s customer relationships. Customer relationships were calculated using the income approach. The following table sets forth the components of identified intangible assets associated with the P3 Acquisition and their estimated useful lives. 

The Company determined the useful lives of intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows and contractual life associated with the respective assets. Customer relationships represent the expected future benefit from contracts and relationships which, at the date of acquisition, were reasonably anticipated to continue given the history and operating practices of P3. 
   
  Goodwill  
   
 Of the total estimated purchase price for the P3 Acquisition, $561,430 was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill recorded resulting from the acquisition is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

  Note 10   Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 The Company has two Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Option Plans that were not terminated as a result of the fiscal 2015 restructuring of the Company and spin-out and have continued as part of the operations as detailed below. 
   
  In fiscal 2015, the option pool pertaining to the 2009 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Option Plan (the  2009 Plan ) was adjusted for a 1 for 101 stock split due to the spin-out and restructuring plan, resulting in an authorized option pool of 18,152. Stock options typically vest over a three-year period and have a life of ten years from the date granted. As of June 30, 2016 there were 3,610 shares available for future awards under this plan.  
     
  In fiscal 2015, the option pool pertaining to the 2012 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Option Plan (the  2012 Plan ) was adjusted for a 1 for 101 stock split due to the spin-out and restructuring plan, resulting in an authorized options pool of 74,257. Stock options typically vest over a three year period and have a life of ten years from the date granted. As of June 30, 2016, there were 45,673 shares available for future awards under this plan.  
     
  In addition, there are approximately 24,753 in options outstanding that were issued to a former CEO of spin-out Company in fiscal 2014. These options issued are outside of the 2009 and 2012 Plans.   
     
  On June 1, 2016 Jim Driscoll was granted for his position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company options to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock outside of the Company s 2009 and 2012 stock option plans (the  Option Agreement ). These options covered 250,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.00 per share to be granted immediately and three additional tranches of 250,000 shares each at an exercise price of $1.50, $2.00 and $2.50 per share, respectively. The remaining three tranches will vest equally over the next three years with the first fully vesting on May 31, 2017 through May 31, 2019. The term of the options will be for a period of five years and may be exercised at any time as to the vested shares. These options were fully cancelled in conjunction with his resignation as of September 27, 2016.  
     
  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded stock compensation expense related to the options granted to Mr. Driscoll of $496,668 and has unrecognized stock expense of $1,040,793 to be recorded over the vesting period. The grant-date fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted for Mr. Driscoll was a range of $1.35-$1.76 and was determined using the following assumptions: expected price volatility is 80.39%, risk-free interest rate of 1.39%, zero expected dividend yield, and 4.0 years expected life of options. The expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company makes assumptions with respect to expected stock price volatility based on the average historical volatility of peers with similar attributes. In addition, the Company determines the risk free rate by selecting the U.S. Treasury with maturities similar to the expected terms of grants, quoted on an investment basis in effect at the time of grant for that business day. As a result of the cancellation of these warrants, the Company has recovered $496,668 as resulted of the elimination of this reserve.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, unrecognized stock compensation expense related to unvested stock options under all Plans was $1,041, 377. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting periods of the outstanding options of 1.92 years. Total stock compensation expense recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 related to the all Plans and options that vested during the period was $508,634.

  Overview  
   
 We are an early stage company that intends to acquire a series of businesses which specialize in compounding pharmacy activities, largely direct to consumers, and to doctors and veterinary professionals. 
   
   Description of Pharmaceutical Compoundin   g  
     
 The vast majority of medications are mass-produced by pharmaceutical drug companies. They aim to treat a specific medical condition for a large segment of people. Problems can arise when a patient has a medical condition that can t be treated by one of these mass-produced products. Pharmaceutical compounding (done in compounding pharmacies) is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product prescribed by doctors to fit the unique needs of a patient that can t be met by commercially available drugs. To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools. This may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid, to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s). It may also be done for more optional reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. Compounding pharmacies (and pharmacists) adhere to standards and regulations set by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, National Association of Boards and State Boards of Pharmacy for quality assurance and accuracy. The compounding pharmacy business has the potential to provide high margins, and allow the pharmacy to specialize is certain solutions for specific maladies, so it can target specific markets efficiently.

We intend to focus on the acquisition of compounders who have a) a large client base in the veterinary area, b) a strong set of proprietary compounding solutions, versus non-proprietary  over-the-counter  (OTC) medicine sales, and c) where the combination of incremental operations will allow cross selling of a growing line of proprietary compounds into the respective markets of each new market participant acquired. 
   
 We expect economies of scale from the consolidation of: 

Materials procurement; 

Compounding activities combined into larger, more efficient and higher quality facilities; 

Expanded marketing nationwide with an emphasis on densely populated urban areas where an expanded product line may increase the profitability of each individual branch, when compared to pre-acquisition sales, and; 

Consolidated administration and personnel functions. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 In the third quarter of 2016, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the section  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 The following period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for the current period or any future period. In particular, our pharmacy operations activities will commence in the third quarter of 2016 and we have spun-out the prior year educational business which is presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. This change in the nature of our operations will have and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our financial results. As a result, our results of operations in the periods after commencement of our pharmacy operations will include aggregate revenue and expense amounts and the apportionment of expenses among categories, have changed and are expected to continue to change as we further develop these operations. Further, as a result of our acquisitions of our compounding pharmacies, and any additional pharmacy acquisitions or other such transactions we may pursue, we may experience large expenditures specific to the transactions that are not incident to our operations. 
   
  For the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
 There are no continuing operating sales and related cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as our first pharmacy acquisition was cancelled during the third quarter. 
   
 Our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 pertaining to continuing operations were $648,165, that were comprised primarily of expenses of $444,100 pertaining consulting services,  $168,152  professional fees related to SEC and audit filings services and legal expense, of which $68,334 was offset through the settlement of payables with Andrew Marks, PPLC and NCSE. 
   
 There is $55,093 and $120,031, of interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, pertaining to interest incurred for outstanding debentures that were not converted resulting from the spin-out, and the convertible promissory notes. 

20 

There was a loss on the conversion of payables into common shares for continuing operations that resulted in debt extinguishment expense of $190,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from legal expenses that were converted into shares. 
   
 There was a net loss for continuing operations of $725,670 for the three ended September 30, 2016 and $3,492,963 for the nine months ended, resulting from the aforementioned operating expenses. 
   
 A comparison has not been provided for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as the financial results for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are reported as discontinued operations as disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 We have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $1,215,834. Our working capital deficit is attributable to the fact that we began implementing the Company s business plan of acquiring pharmaceutical compounding businesses. 
     
 A comparison has not been provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as the financial results for nine months ended September 30, 2015 are reported as discontinued operations as disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Specific details related to our financing activities are as follows:  
   
  2016 Private Placements  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we raised gross proceeds of $60,000 through the sale of 120,000 shares of common stock to accredited investors in private placement transactions at a price of $0.50 per share. We incurred $9,000 of securities issuance costs representing commissions paid to broker-dealers who assisted with these transactions. 
   
 On March 18, 2016, we issued a 12% Convertible Promissory Note (the  Convertible Note ) in the principal amount of $60,000 to the Lender. Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Note, on the date thereof, we issued the Convertible Note to the Lender and, as consideration therefor, the Lender paid us in cash the full principal amount of the Convertible Note. Upon issuance the lender was awarded 15,000 restricted common shares as an origination fee which will have piggy back registration rights. 
   
 On May 19, 2016, we issued a 10% Convertible Promissory Note (the  Convertible Note B ) in the principal amount of $100,000 to the Lender. Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Note B, on the date thereof, we issued the Convertible Note B to the Lender and, as consideration therefor, the Lender paid us in cash the full principal amount of the Convertible Note B. Upon issuance the lender was awarded 66,666 warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 for a term of twenty-four months. 
   
  Financial Advisors  
     
 We engaged the services of brokers and investment bankers to assist us with accessing our growth capital. In exchange, we will pay fees of up to 8% of the aggregate price upon closing any fundraising. Also, the advisors may be entitled to warrants to purchase shares of our common stock of up to 8% of the shares sold in the offering. 
   
  Plan of Operations  
   
 We are entering the Compounding Pharmacy Industry via a roll-up of existing compounding pharmacies consolidating fragmented market. The key elements of our strategy include: 

we intend to grow regionally, building regional distribution centers, expand sales and marketing with eventually with a national presence; 

we intend to acquire multiple libraries of compounding formulations in the process, recognizing that: 

some are tailored for local needs; 

some will have regional markets with expanded marketing; 

some can become nationally accepted, and further  productized  solutions; 

in all cases, we intend to drive the costs down when compared to alternatives from  big pharma . 

21 

The human market and the vet market are both large and growing, share many of the same solutions, and are in need of lower cost solutions. We will focus on a balance between legitimate insurance related revenue streams and cash pay business. We believe the pharmacy industry, and especially compounding pharmacy, can easily be described as having multiple  flavors . We believe the markets for both people and pets are both underserved: 

Some sell basic OTC medications and provide  delivery only , and most users rely on insurance reimbursement for payment; 

Some are  value added resellers , using OTC recognized medications, then repackaging, or using combinations, to personalize the product for the client. While vet based is a cash business, the human side is largely insurance reliant; 

Some are like  OEM manufacturers , like a generic drug maker, starting with basic, non-productized materials, and creating both standard and fully customized  novel  formulations for specific maladies and needs. These are more often cash clients, and this approach is well accepted in the pet area, and becoming more accepted for people as alternatives to OTC, and for cash buyers seeking lower cost; 

We believe a mix of these can serve the need to drive costs down, and allow innovative approaches to improve patient results.

ITEM 4.   
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.    
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ), we carried out an evaluation regarding the nine months ended September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer who is also serving as our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based upon this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover every situation involving the failure of persons within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports.  
   
 The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As of the Evaluation Date, no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K contains information regarding a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 due to an inadequate segregation of duties resulting from our limited number of employees whom duties can be allocated. 
   
 During the second quarter of 2016, there were no changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  
   
    ITEM 1.

We entered into a settlement agreement with NCSE as of September 27, 2016, calling for a payment of $48,500 if paid by November 4, 2016, and $75,000 if paid later. We have recorded an amount in our payables of $75,000 for this obligation.
