1.      Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Kelly Services, Inc. (the  Company,   Kelly,   we  or  us ) have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and do not include all the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods, have been made.  The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year.  The unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18, 2016 (the   2015   consolidated financial statements).  The Company s   third   fiscal quarter ended on   October 2, 2016   (  2016  ) and   September 27, 2015   (  2015  ), each of which contained   13   weeks.    The corresponding September year to date periods for 2016 and 2015 each contained 39 weeks.    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years  consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation. 

2.  Investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific 
  On July 4, 2016, the Company and Temp Holdings Co., Ltd. ( Temp Holdings ), a leading integrated human resources company in Japan, completed a transaction to form a new joint venture, TS Kelly Asia Pacific.  The Company transferred its Asia Pacific staffing operations and certain APAC OCG businesses in exchange for a   49%   ownership interest in TS Kelly Asia Pacific and   $36.5 million   in cash received at closing.  The Company subsequently deconsolidated the contributed APAC staffing and OCG operations and recorded a   $104.2 million   investment in equity affiliate on the consolidated balance sheet, which represented the fair value of the Company s ownership interest in TS Kelly Asia Pacific as of July 4, 2016.  The operating results of the Company s interest in TS Kelly Asia Pacific will be accounted for on a one-quarter lag under the equity method.  Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2016 do not include operating results for TS Kelly Asia Pacific.  In the fourth quarter, the Company will also receive a   $4.5 million   post-close cash true-up adjustment from Temp Holdings.  The Company s interest in TS Kelly Workforce Solutions is expected to be transferred to TS Kelly Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter under the terms of the transaction agreement. 
  The Company recorded a pretax gain of   $87.2 million   on the investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific     in the consolidated statement of earnings which represents the fair value of the Company s retained investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific in addition to the cash received less the carrying value of net assets transferred to the joint venture.  Income taxes of     $23.5 million     on this gain result primarily from recording deferred income taxes on outside basis differences.      The fair value of the Company s contributed operations was determined using both an income-based and market-based approach.  The income approach utilized a discounted cash flow analysis which included significant assumptions about the timing of future cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates commensurate with the underlying risks of the investment.  The market approach entailed deriving market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar financial and operating characteristics to TS Kelly Asia Pacific and corroborated the results of the discounted cash flow method.   
  As part of this transaction, the Company deconsolidated the goodwill related to the contributed entities in our APAC PT and OCG segments amounting to   $1.9 million  .   
  The amount due to TS Kelly Asia Pacific was   $2.1 million   as of third quarter-end 2016. 
   
  3.  Fair Value Measurements 
  Trade accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and related taxes approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. 
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following tables present assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheet as of   third   quarter-end   2016   and year-end   2015   by fair value hierarchy level, as described below.

    KELLY SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Level 1 measurements consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 measurements include quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs. 

Money market funds as of   third   quarter-end   2016   represent investments in government money market accounts, and as of year-end   2015   represent investments in prime money market accounts, all of which are restricted as to use and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  The valuations were based on quoted market prices of those accounts as of the respective period end.  
  Available-for-sale investment represents the Company s investment in Temp Holdings and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  The valuation is based on the quoted market price of Temp Holdings stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of the period end.  The unrealized gain, net of tax, of   $1.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $16.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015   was recorded in other comprehensive income, and in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders  equity.  The unrealized gain, net of tax, of   $8.8 million   for   September year to date     2016   and   $23.0 million   for   September year to date     2015   was recorded in other comprehensive income, as well as in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of this yen-denominated investment, which fluctuates based on foreign exchange rates, was   $20.4 million   as of the   third   quarter-end   2016   and   $17.2 million   at year-end   2015  .

7.  Earnings Per Share 
  The reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share on common stock for the   third quarter and September year to date 2016 and 2015   follows (in millions of dollars except per share data):   

  Potentially dilutive shares outstanding are primarily related to performance shares for the   third quarter and September year to date 2016 and 2015  .  Stock options excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect for the   third quarter and September year to date 2016 and 2015   were not significant. 

8.  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Performance Shares 
  On February 17, 2016, the Company granted performance awards associated with the Company s Class A stock to certain senior officers.  The payment of performance shares, which will be satisfied with the issuance of shares out of treasury stock, is contingent upon the achievement of specific performance goals over a stated period of time.  For the 2016 performance share grant, the total target number of performance shares granted is   331,500  , and the maximum number of performance shares that may be earned is   663,000  , which assumes   200%   of the target shares originally granted.  Target shares of   248,625   may be earned upon the achievement of three financial goals ( financial measure performance shares ) and target shares of   82,875   may be earned based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to the S P SmallCap 600 Index ( TSR performance shares ).  No dividends are paid on these performance shares. 
  
   14 

    KELLY SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

The financial measure performance shares, which have a weighted average grant date fair value of   $15.85  , have a   three  -year performance period through December 31, 2018.  These shares will cliff-vest after approval by the Compensation Committee, which will be no later than March 15, 2019, if not forfeited by the recipient.  For each of the three financial measures, there are annual goals set in February of each year, with the total award payout based on a cumulative average of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 goals.  Accordingly, the Company will remeasure the fair value of the 2016 financial measure performance shares each reporting period until the 2018 goals are set, after which the fair value will be fixed for the remaining performance period.  As of   third   quarter-end   2016  , the current fair value for financial measure performance shares was   $18.34  . 
  The TSR performance shares also have a   three  -year performance period through December, 31, 2018 and have an estimated fair value of   $19.73  , which was computed using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating assumptions for inputs of expected stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.  These shares will cliff-vest after approval by the Compensation Committee, which will be no later than March 15, 2019, if not forfeited by the recipient. 
  For the   third   quarter   2016   and   2015  , respectively, total compensation expense related to all performance shares was   $1.0 million   and   $0.8 million  , and the related tax benefit was   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million  . For   September year to date     2016   and   2015  , respectively, total compensation expense related to all performance shares was   $3.1 million   and   $1.1 million  , and the related tax benefit was   $1.2 million   and   $0.4 million  . 

9.  Other Expense, Net    
  Included in other expense, net for the   third quarter and September year to date 2016 and 2015   are the following:  

10.  Contingencies 
  The Company is a party to a pending nationwide class action lawsuit entitled Hillson et.al. v Kelly Services.  The suit alleges that current and former temporary employees of Kelly Services are entitled to monetary damages for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act requirement that the notice and disclosure form provided to employees for purposes of conducting a background screening be a standalone document.  On April 20, 2016, the parties entered into a formal settlement agreement.  The parties still must secure court approval of the settlement.  In light of amounts previously expensed and anticipated recoveries from third parties, Kelly recorded an accrual in the fourth quarter of 2015 of   $4.1 million   (in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet) to reflect the expected cost of the tentative settlement. 
  The Company is continuously engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business, such as matters alleging employment discrimination, alleging wage and hour violations or enforcing the restrictive covenants in the Company s employment agreements.  The Company has recently experienced an increase in its litigation volume, including cases where claimants seek class action certification.  While there is no expectation that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainty and the Company is not able to reasonably predict if any matter will be resolved in a manner that is materially adverse to the Company.

11.  Segment Disclosures  
  The Company s segments are based on the organizational structure for which financial results are regularly evaluated by the Company s chief operating decision makers ( CODM ), the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, to determine resource allocation and assess performance.  The Company s   seven   reporting segments are: (1) Americas Commercial, (2) Americas Professional and Technical ( Americas PT ), (3) Europe, Middle East and Africa Commercial ( EMEA Commercial ), (4) Europe, Middle East and Africa Professional and Technical ( EMEA PT ), (5) Asia Pacific Commercial ( APAC Commercial ), (6) Asia Pacific Professional and Technical ( APAC PT ) and (7) Outsourcing and Consulting Group ( OCG ).  
  The Commercial business segments within the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions represent traditional office services, contact-center staffing, marketing, electronic assembly, light industrial and, in the Americas, substitute teachers.  The PT segments encompass a wide range of highly skilled temporary employees, including scientists, financial professionals, attorneys, engineers, IT specialists and healthcare workers.  OCG includes recruitment process outsourcing ( RPO ), contingent workforce outsourcing ( CWO ), business process outsourcing ( BPO ), payroll process outsourcing ( PPO ), executive placement and career transition/outplacement services.  Corporate expenses that directly support the operating units have been allocated to the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions and OCG based on a work effort, volume or, in the absence of a readily available measurement process, proportionately based on revenue from services. 
  The Company regularly assesses its organizational structure, product/service offerings and information evaluated by the CODM to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact its segment reporting structure.  The Company may change how it allocates resources and analyzes performance, which may result in a change to the Company s segment reporting in the future. 
  The following tables present information about the reported revenue from services and gross profit of the Company by segment, along with a reconciliation to consolidated earnings before taxes, for the   third quarter and September year to date 2016 and 2015  .  Segment information for 2016 is impacted by the transfer of the APAC Commercial, APAC PT and certain OCG businesses to TS Kelly Asia Pacific in the third quarter of 2016 (see Investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific footnote). 
   Asset information by reportable segment is not presented, since the Company does not produce such information internally nor does it use such data to manage its business.

12.      New Accounting Pronouncements   
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 clarifying how entities should classify certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance addresses classification of cash flows related to the following transactions: 1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; 6) distributions received from equity method investees; and 7) beneficial interests in securitization transaction.  ASU 2016-15 also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires retrospective application.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 amending how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  The guidance requires the application of a current expected credit loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses.  Under this model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred.  This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 amending several aspects of share-based payment accounting.  This guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, with prospective application required.  The guidance also changes the classification of such tax benefits or tax deficiencies on the statement of cash flows from a financing activity to an operating activity, with retrospective or prospective application allowed.  Additionally, the guidance requires the classification of employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows, with retrospective application required.  This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 amending the existing accounting standards for lease accounting and requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months, including those classified as operating leases.  Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs.  Consistent with current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), the presentation of expenses and cash flows will depend primarily on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease.  The new standard also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases in order to provide additional information about the nature of an organization s leasing activities.  This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 amending the current guidance for how entities measure certain equity investments, the accounting for financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements relating to financial instruments.  The new guidance requires entities to use fair value measurement for equity investments in unconsolidated entities, excluding equity method investments, and to recognize the changes in fair value in net income at the end of each reporting period.  Under the new standard, for any financial liabilities in which the fair value option has been elected, the changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk must be recognized separately in other comprehensive income.  Presentation and disclosure requirements under the new guidance require public business entities to use the exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost.  In addition, financial assets and liabilities must now be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements and grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset.  This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after

    KELLY SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is only permitted for the financial liability provision.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, which is currently performed by the external auditors.  Management will be required to perform this assessment for both interim and annual reporting periods and must make certain disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists.  This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods thereafter.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance under ASU 2014-09 that will supersede the existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The new standard focuses on creating a single source of revenue guidance for revenue arising from contracts with customers for all industries.  The objective of the new standard is for companies to recognize revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to its customers at an amount that represents what the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year (ASU 2015-14).  This ASU will now be effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016.  Since the issuance of the original standard, the FASB has issued several other subsequent updates including the following: 1) clarification of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations (ASU 2016-08); 2) further guidance on identifying performance obligations in a contract as well as clarifications on the licensing implementation guidance (ASU 2016-10); 3) rescission of several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605 (ASU 2016-11); and 4) additional guidance and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues (ASU 2016-12).  The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and we expect to implement the standard with the modified retrospective approach, which recognizes the cumulative effect of application recognized on that date.  We are evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position and cash flows.    
  Management has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
   
  Executive Overview 
  The Workforce Solutions Industry 
  The staffing industry has changed dramatically over the last decade   transformed by globalization, competitive consolidation and secular shifts in labor supply and demand.  Global employment trends are reshaping and redefining traditional employment models, sourcing strategies and human resource capability requirements.  In response, the industry has accelerated its evolution from commercial into professional/technical and outsourced solutions. 
  The broader workforce solutions industry has continued to evolve to meet businesses  growing demand for total workforce or talent supply chain management ( TSCM ) solutions.  As clients  workforce solutions strategies move up the maturity model, the TSCM concept seeks to manage all categories of talent (temporary, project-based, outsourced and full-time) and thus represents significant market potential. 
  Strategic clients are increasingly looking for global, flexible and holistic talent solutions that encompass all worker categories, driving adoption of our TSCM approach covering temporary staffing, Contingent Workforce Outsourcing ( CWO ), Recruitment Process Outsourcing ( RPO ), Business Process Outsourcing ( BPO ), independent contractor management, strategic workforce planning and more. 
  Across all regions, the structural shifts toward higher-skilled, project-based professional/technical talent continue to represent long-term opportunities for the industry.  In fact, professional/technical staffing is projected to increase as a percent of the global market, with demand for professional/technical staffing projected to outpace commercial. 
  Our Business 
  Kelly Services is a global workforce solutions company, serving customers of all sizes in a variety of industries.  Our staffing operations are divided into three regions (Americas, EMEA and APAC), with commercial and professional/technical staffing businesses in each region.  As the human capital arena has become more complex, we have also developed a suite of innovative solutions within our global Outsourcing   Consulting Group (OCG).  OCG delivers integrated talent management solutions to meet customer needs across the entire spectrum of talent categories.  Using talent supply chain strategies, we help customers plan for and manage their acquisition of contingent and full-time labor, and gain access to service providers and quality talent at competitive rates with minimized risk. 
  We earn revenues from the hourly sales of services by our temporary employees to customers, as a result of recruiting permanent employees for our customers, and through our outsourcing activities.  Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable.  The nature of our business is such that trade accounts receivable are our most significant financial asset.  Average days sales outstanding varies within and outside the U.S., but was 56 days on a global basis as of the   2016     third   quarter end, 54 days as of the   2015   year end and 57 days as of the   2015     third   quarter end.  Since receipts from customers generally lag temporary employee payroll, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. 
  Our Strategy and Outlook  
  Our long-term strategic objective is to create shareholder value by delivering a competitive profit from the best workforce solutions and talent in the industry.  To achieve this, we are focused on the following key areas: 
             
    Maintain our core strengths in commercial staffing in key markets; 
                
    Grow our professional and technical solutions; 
                
    Enhance our position as a market-leading provider of talent supply chain management in our OCG segment; and 
                
    Lower our costs through deployment of efficient service delivery models. 
     Fueled by our 2014 investments in higher-margin specialties and solutions, Kelly s strong performance in 2015 reaffirmed our strategic path and enabled us to raise the cash dividend for our shareholders.  With a year of proven execution behind us, we entered 2016 with renewed confidence.  Early in the year, we announced plans to expand our joint venture with Temp Holdings and form one of the largest workforce solutions companies in the Asia-Pacific region, and have since completed that joint venture, TS Kelly Asia Pacific.  Our U.S. branch network is delivering growth in PT staffing, and our global OCG business continues to expand its customer reach and gain third-party validation as a leading provider of talent supply chain management solutions.  
  
   20 

In line with our strategy, we took actions during the second quarter of 2016 in the Americas and EMEA designed to increase operational efficiency and align our staffing operations with growth levels within their markets.  As a result, we recorded $3.4 million of restructuring expenses in the second quarter.  Kelly s third quarter results confirm the actions taken as we continue our commitment to our strategy and to driving improved profitability within our operating segments: 
              
    In the OCG segment, earnings from operations totaled $7.7 million, compared to $8.2 million the same period last year.  OCG continued to deliver gross profit growth, but investments in additional headcount and sales resources lowered overall operating profit.  Solid growth in BPO continues, which is a key driver of our strategic and financial progress. 
                
    After strong demand in the first quarter, the U.S. staffing market softened in the second quarter and began to show signs of stabilization in the third quarter.  Overall Americas PT revenue fell 1% year over year, though accounts serviced through our U.S. branch network delivered positive PT growth.  We will need to continue to accelerate PT growth, particularly within accounts serviced through our centralized delivery model, to fully realize the expected benefit of our investments.  Despite the softer U.S. market, the Americas region delivered consistent year-over-year earnings from operations.  
                
    Despite uneven economic conditions, EMEA continues to execute against its strategy.  For the quarter, EMEA delivered $4.4 million of earnings from operations, compared to $5.3 million a year ago. 
     Kelly remains focused on executing a well-formed strategy with increased speed and precision, making the necessary investments and adjustments to advance that strategy.  We have set our sights on becoming an even more competitive, consultative and profitable company, and we are reshaping our business to make that vision a reality.  We will continue to rebalance our resources to align with our goals for growth, intentionally focusing more of our workforce in roles that drive increased revenue and gross profit for the Company.  We will measure our progress against both revenue and gross profit growth and an improved conversion rate.  The goals we have established are based on the current economic and business environment, and may change as conditions warrant: 
             
    We expect to grow PT and OCG revenue, creating a more balanced portfolio that yields benefits from an improved mix. 
                
    We expect Commercial to remain a core component of our strategy. 
                
    We expect to exercise strict control over our cost base, delivering structural improvements that create strong operating leverage. 
                
    And, as a result, we expect our conversion rate to continue to improve.  
     Looking ahead, we are keeping a watchful eye on demand levels in the U.S. labor market while anticipating an increasing demand for skilled workers.  Despite uncertainties, we know that companies are relying more heavily on the use of flexible staffing models; there is growing acceptance of free agents and contractual employment by companies and talent alike; and companies are seeking more comprehensive workforce management solutions that lend themselves to Kelly s talent supply chain management approach.  This shift in demand for contingent labor and strategic solutions plays to our strengths and experience   particularly serving large companies whose needs span the globe and cross multiple labor categories.

Financial Measures  
  The constant currency ( CC ) change amounts in the following tables refer to the year-over-year percentage changes resulting from translating 2016 financial data into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates used to translate financial data for 2015.  We believe that CC measurements are a useful measure, indicating the actual trends of our operations without distortion due to currency fluctuations.  We use CC results when analyzing the performance of our segments and measuring our results against that of our competitors.  Additionally, substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries derive revenues and incur cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) within a single country and currency which, as a result, provide a natural hedge against currency risks in connection with their normal business operations. 
  CC measures are non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures and are used to supplement measures in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from those provided by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.  Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  Return on sales (earnings from operations divided by revenue from services) and conversion rate (earnings from operations divided by gross profit) in the following tables are ratios used to measure the Company s operating efficiency.  
  Staffing Fee-Based Income 
  Staffing fee-based income, which is included in revenue from services in the following tables, has a significant impact on gross profit rates.  There are very low direct costs of services associated with staffing fee-based income.  Therefore, increases or decreases in staffing fee-based income can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates.

Results of Operations 
  Total Company -   Third Quarter    
  (Dollars in millions) 

During the third quarter of 2016, we transferred our APAC staffing and certain APAC OCG businesses in exchange for a 49% interest in the TS Kelly Asia Pacific joint venture.  Accordingly, third quarter 2016 results of operations reflect the impact of transferring these operations to the joint venture. 
  Total Company revenue from services for the third quarter of 2016 was down 7.6% in comparison to the prior year and down 7.1% on a CC basis.  The decrease was due to the effect of the transfer of the APAC staffing operations, as well as the changes noted in the following Americas and EMEA region discussions.   
  The gross profit rate increased by 30 basis points, of which the transfer of APAC businesses accounted for 20 basis points.  Additionally, as more fully described in the following discussions, increases in the Americas and OCG gross profit rates were partially offset by a decline in the gross profit rate in the EMEA region.  
  Total SG A expenses decreased 7.3% on a reported basis and 6.9% on a CC basis.  The reduction in SG A expenses for the third quarter of 2016 reflects the transfer of APAC staffing operations, as well as decreases in expense in our staffing operations.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in SG A expenses in OCG, reflecting continued investment in that operating segment.  Also included in total SG A expenses is a one-time savings of $7.5 million related to the reduction in performance-based compensation expenses. 
  Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $24.7 million, compared to $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2015.  Our tax expense is affected by recurring items, such as the amount of pretax income and its mix by jurisdiction, U.S. work opportunity credits and the change in cash surrender value of non-taxable investments in life insurance policies.  It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as tax law changes, or changes in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.  The increase in income tax expense from the prior year is primarily due to tax expense of $23.5 million from the gain on the investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific, the impact of which is partially offset by the reinstatement of the work opportunity credit program and improved non-taxable investment income. Valuation allowances in certain foreign countries could be reduced up to $7 million in the near term if future taxable income is sufficient to make it more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realizable in those jurisdictions. 
  Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 were $2.06, as compared to $0.23 for the third quarter of 2015. 

23 

Total Americas -   Third Quarter    
  (Dollars in millions)   

The change in Americas revenue from services on a reported basis was due to a 3% decrease in hours volume, partially offset by a 1% increase in average bill rates (a 2% increase on a CC basis).  The increase in average bill rates was due to wage rate inflation and the resulting impact on the bill rate.  Americas represented 68% of total Company revenue in the third quarter of 2016 and 64% in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Revenue in our Commercial segment was down 2% on a reported basis and down 1% on a CC basis in comparison to the prior year.  The lower revenue was primarily due to a decrease in our office services volume in both our branch-based and centralized delivery models.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in our educational staffing business and in our light industrial product due to new customer wins.  
  In the PT segment, reported and CC revenue was down 1% in comparison to the prior year.  We had a revenue decrease of 3% in the accounts serviced through our centralized delivery model, partially offset by a 3% revenue increase in the accounts serviced through our branch delivery network.  Revenue increased in our finance and IT products, while revenue in our science and engineering products were down compared to a year ago. 
  The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to improved management of our payroll taxes, partially offset by an increase in our workers  compensation cost as compared to a year ago. 
  Total SG A expenses decreased 1.4% on a reported basis and 1.2% on a CC basis, due primarily to lower salary cost as a result of the cost reduction initiatives we took in the second quarter of 2016.  

24 

Total EMEA -   Third Quarter    
  (Dollars in millions) 

The change in EMEA revenue from services was due to a 4% decrease in average bill rates (a 2% decrease on a CC basis) due to country mix, partially offset by a 2% increase in hours volume.  The increase in hours volume was due to Portugal, partially offset by a decrease in the U.K.  EMEA represented 19% of total Company revenue in the third quarter of 2016 and 18% in the third quarter of 2015.  
  The EMEA gross profit rate decreased primarily due to a decline in the temporary staffing gross profit rate, which was mainly driven by an unfavorable customer mix in Switzerland and the U.K.  Staffing fee-based income decreased primarily in Western Europe, with demand mainly weakening in the U.K. 
  Total SG A expenses decreased 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.0% on a CC basis, due to effective cost control in headquarters expenses across the region, partially offset by targeted investments in our branch network. 

25 

OCG -   Third Quarter    
  (Dollars in millions)   

The increase in revenue from services in the OCG segment was due primarily to growth in the BPO and RPO practice areas.  Revenue in BPO grew by 6% year over year and RPO revenue increased 7%.  This revenue growth was due to the expansion of programs with existing customers and, to a lesser extent, new customers.  OCG revenue represented 14% of total Company revenue in the third quarter of 2016 and 13% in the third quarter of 2015. 
  The change in the OCG gross profit rate was primarily due to increased gross profit rates in RPO, BPO and CWO as a result of customer and business mix within the practice areas. 
  The increase in SG A expenses was primarily a result of increased headcount, as well as costs related to additional sales resources, including performance-based compensation.

Results of Operations 
  Total Company -   September Year to Date    
  (Dollars in millions) 

Total Company results of operations for the first nine months of 2016 were impacted by the transfer of APAC staffing and certain APAC OCG businesses to the TS Kelly Asia Pacific joint venture in the third quarter of 2016.  Accordingly, separate APAC results for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 are not presented in the following discussions due to the lack of comparability between the periods. 
  Total Company revenue from services for the first nine months of 2016 was down 2.1% in comparison to the prior year on a reported basis, and down 0.7% on a CC basis, due to the transfer of the APAC operations and as more fully described in the following discussions.   
  The gross profit rate increased 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis, of which the transfer of the APAC businesses accounted for 10 basis points.  Additionally, as more fully described in the following discussions, increases in the Americas and OCG gross profit rates were partially offset by a decline in the gross profit rate in the EMEA region. 
  Total SG A expenses increased 0.7% on a reported basis and 1.8% on a CC basis.  Included in SG A expenses are restructuring charges of $3.4 million, which relate to actions taken in the Americas and EMEA regions to manage operating expenses and prepare the businesses for future growth.  Also included in SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2016 is $1.8 million of one-time costs related to the expansion of the APAC staffing joint venture and an increase in OCG SG A expenses due to growth in that segment.  These increases were partially offset by continued cost management efforts in the EMEA region and a decrease due to the transfer of APAC operations to the joint venture. 
  Income tax expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $28.2 million, compared to $17.1 million for the first nine months of 2015.  Our tax expense is affected by recurring items, such as the amount of pretax income and its mix by jurisdiction, U.S. work opportunity credits and the change in cash surrender value of non-taxable investments in life insurance policies.  It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as tax law changes, or changes in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.  The increase in income tax expense from the prior year is primarily due to tax expense of $23.5 million from the gain on the investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific, the impact of which is partially offset by the reinstatement of the work opportunity credit program and improved non-taxable investment income.  Valuation allowances in certain foreign countries could be reduced by up to $7 million in the near term if future taxable income is sufficient to make it more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realizable in those jurisdictions. 
  Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2016 were $2.58, as compared to $0.51 for the first nine months of 2015. 

27 

Total Americas -   September Year to Date    
  (Dollars in millions) 

The decrease in reported Americas revenue from services was due to a 2% decrease in hours volume, partially offset by a 1% increase in average bill rates (a 2% increase on a CC basis).  This increase was due to a combination of wage and bill rate inflation, increased pricing in a number of accounts serviced through our branch-based delivery model, as well as business mix.  Americas represented 66% of total Company revenue in the first nine months of 2016 and 65% in the first nine months of 2015. 
  Revenue in our Commercial segment decreased 1% on a reported basis and was flat on a CC basis in comparison to the prior year.  The change in CC revenue in Commercial was primarily due to increases in our educational staffing business and in our light industrial product.  These increases were offset by a decrease in our office services business in both our branch-based delivery model and our centralized delivery model.  
  In the PT segment, reported and CC revenue was flat in comparison to the prior year.  PT revenue is up 5% in accounts serviced by our branch-based delivery model, while PT revenue is down 2% in accounts serviced by our centralized delivery model. 
  The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to improved management of our payroll taxes, coupled with higher staffing fee-based income, partially offset by higher workers  compensation costs. 
  Total SG A expenses increased 0.8% on a reported basis and 1.5% on a CC basis.  Included in SG A expenses are restructuring charges of $2.2 million.  These charges represent severance costs related to headcount reductions as well as lease buyout costs due to branch consolidations.  SG A expenses excluding restructuring charges increased 0.2% on a reported basis and 0.9% on a CC basis.  This increase is primarily the result of costs related to additional sales resources, partially offset by lower incentive payments.   
  
   28 

Total EMEA -   September Year to Date    
  (Dollars in millions) 

The change in reported EMEA revenue from services was due to a 2% decrease in average bill rates (a 1% increase on a CC basis), partially offset by a 1% increase in hours volume.  The increase in average bill rates on a CC basis was due primarily to the U.K., and the increase in hours volume was primarily due to Portugal.  EMEA represented 18% of total Company revenue in the first nine months of 2016 and 17% in the first nine months of 2015. 
  The EMEA gross profit rate decreased primarily due to a decline in the temporary gross profit rate, mainly driven by unfavorable customer mix in Switzerland and the U.K.  Staffing fee-based income increased primarily in Western Europe, partially offset by a decrease in the U.K.    
  Total SG A expenses decreased 5.3% on a reported basis and 2.7% on a CC basis, primarily due to effective cost control in headquarters expenses across the region.  Included in SG A expenses are restructuring charges of $1.2 million, which reflect a repositioning of the operating model to pursue growth in staffing fee-based income and specialized temporary staffing business in Italy.  

29 

OCG -   September Year to Date    
  (Dollars in millions) 

Revenue from services in the OCG segment increased during the first nine months of 2016 due primarily to growth in the BPO, CWO and RPO practice areas.  Revenue in BPO grew by 10% year over year, CWO, which includes PPO, grew by 4% year over year and RPO grew 3% year over year.  The revenue growth in BPO, CWO and RPO was due primarily to the expansion of programs with existing customers and, to a lesser extent, new customers. OCG revenue represented 13% of total Company revenue in the first nine months of 2016 and 12% in the first nine months of 2015. 
  The OCG gross profit rate increased primarily due to an increased gross profit rates in BPO, RPO and CWO as a result of customer and practice area mix. 
  The increase in SG A expenses was primarily a result of costs related to additional sales resources, as well as costs associated with increased volume with existing customers, including salaries and performance-based compensation.    
  
   30 

Financial Condition 
  Historically, we have financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and access to credit markets.  Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth.  Conversely, when economic activity slows, working capital requirements may substantially decrease.  As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components: cash and equivalents, operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. 
  Cash and Equivalents 
  Cash and equivalents totaled   $27.6 million   at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $42.2 million   at year-end   2015  . As further described below, we   generated     $26.1 million   of cash from operating activities,   generated     $10.6 million   of cash from investing activities and   used     $55.1 million   of cash for financing activities. 
  Operating Activities 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we   generated     $26.1 million   of net cash from operating activities, as compared to   using     $1.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  This change was the result of lower growth in trade accounts receivable due in part to improved global days sales outstanding ( DSO ) as noted below, as well as improving net earnings.  
  Trade accounts receivable totaled   $1.1 billion   at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016  .  Global DSO were 56 days at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   and 57 at the end of the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
  Our working capital position (total current assets less total current liabilities) was $430.0 million at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016  , an increase of $18.7 million from year-end   2015  .  The current ratio (total current assets divided by total current liabilities) was 1.6 at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   and 1.5 at year-end   2015  . 
  Investing Activities 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we   generated     $10.6 million   of cash from investing activities, as compared to   using     $13.2 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Included in cash from investing activities is $18.8 million of net cash representing the cash received less the cash deconsolidated relating to the TS Kelly Asia Pacific joint venture transaction.  Capital expenditures in both years relate primarily to the Company s technology programs.   
  Financing Activities 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we   used     $55.1 million   of cash for financing activities, as compared to   using     $19.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The change in cash used in financing activities was caused by decreased short-term borrowings.  Debt totaled $8.7 million at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   and $55.5 million at year-end   2015  .  Debt-to-total capital (total debt reported on the balance sheet divided by total debt plus stockholders  equity) is a common ratio to measure the relative capital structure and leverage of the Company.  Our ratio of debt-to-total capital was 0.8% at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   and 5.8% at year-end   2015  . 
  The net change in short-term borrowings in the first   nine   months of   2016   and 2015 was primarily due to payments on our U.S. securitization facility. 
  We made dividend payments of $7.7 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and $5.7 million in the first   nine   months of   2015  .

  We expect to meet our ongoing short-term and long-term cash requirements principally through cash generated from operations, available cash and equivalents, securitization of customer receivables and committed unused credit facilities.  Additional funding sources could include public or private bonds, asset-based lending, additional bank facilities, issuance of equity or other sources. 
  We utilize intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions and redemptions to effectively manage our cash on a global basis.  We periodically review our foreign subsidiaries  cash balances and projected cash needs.  As part of those reviews, we may identify cash that we feel should be repatriated to optimize the Company s overall capital structure.  As of the   2016     third   quarter end, these reviews have not resulted in any specific plans to repatriate a majority of our international cash balances.  We expect much of our international cash will be needed to fund working capital growth in our local operations.  The majority of our international cash is concentrated in a cash pooling arrangement (the  Cash Pool ) and is available to fund general corporate needs internationally.  The Cash Pool is a set of cash accounts maintained with a single bank that must, as a whole, maintain at least a zero balance; individual accounts may be positive or negative.  This allows countries with excess cash to invest and countries with cash needs to utilize the excess cash. 
  We manage our cash and debt very closely to optimize our capital structure.  As our cash balances build, we tend to pay down debt as appropriate.  Conversely, when working capital needs grow, we tend to use corporate cash and cash available in the Cash Pool first, and then access our borrowing facilities. 
  As of the   2016     third   quarter end, we had $199.0 million of available capacity on our $200.0 million revolving credit facility and $101.6 million of available capacity on our $150.0 million securitization facility.  The securitization facility carried no short-term borrowings and $48.4 million of standby letters of credit related to workers  compensation.  Together, the revolving credit and securitization facilities provide the Company with committed funding capacity that may be used for general corporate purposes.  While we believe these facilities will cover our working capital needs over the short term, if economic conditions or operating results change significantly, we may need to seek additional sources of funds.  As of the   2016     third   quarter end, we met the debt covenants related to our revolving credit facility and securitization facility.  We intend to refinance our revolving credit facility and securitization facility in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  We monitor the credit ratings of our major banking partners on a regular basis and have regular discussions with them.  Based on our reviews and communications, we believe the risk of one or more of our banks not being able to honor commitments is insignificant.  We also review the ratings and holdings of our money market funds and other investment vehicles regularly to ensure high credit quality and access to our invested cash.

Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements contained in this report are  forward-looking  statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as  expects,   anticipates,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates,  or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases.  In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future actions by us that may be provided by management, including oral statements or other written materials released to the public, are also forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our Company and economic and market factors in the countries in which we do business, among other things.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we have no specific intention to update these statements.  
  Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors.  The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, competitive market pressures including pricing and technology introductions, changing market and economic conditions, our ability to achieve our business strategy,  the risk of damage to our brand, the risk our intellectual assets could be infringed upon or compromised, our ability to successfully develop new service offerings, our exposure to risks associated with services outside traditional staffing, including business process outsourcing, our increasing dependency on third parties for the execution of critical functions, the risks associated with past and future acquisitions, exposure to risks associated with investments in equity affiliates including TS Kelly Asia Pacific, material changes in demand from or loss of large corporate customers, risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including foreign currency fluctuations, availability of full-time employees to lead complex talent supply chain sales and operations, availability of temporary workers with appropriate skills required by customers, liabilities for employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits and collective actions, the risk of cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security as well as risks associated with compliance on data privacy, our ability to sustain critical business applications through our key data centers, our ability to effectively implement and manage our information technology programs, our ability to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls, impairment charges triggered by adverse industry developments or operational circumstances, unexpected changes in claim trends on workers  compensation, disability and medical benefit plans, the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on our business, the impact of changes in laws and regulations (including federal, state and international tax laws), the risk of additional tax or unclaimed property liabilities in excess of our estimates, our ability to maintain specified financial covenants in our bank facilities to continue to access credit markets, and other risks, uncertainties and factors discussed in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements contained herein, and we have no intention to update these statements.  Certain risk factors are discussed more fully under  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  We are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily related to our foreign subsidiaries.  Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in subsidiaries, local currency denominated borrowings and intercompany transactions with and between subsidiaries.  Our foreign subsidiaries primarily derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and currency which, as a result, provide a natural hedge against currency risks in connection with normal business operations.  Accordingly, changes in foreign currency rates vs. the U.S. dollar generally do not impact local cash flows.  Intercompany transactions which create foreign currency risk include services, royalties, loans, contributions and distributions.  
  In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risks through our use of the multi-currency line of credit and other borrowings.  A hypothetical fluctuation of 10% of market interest rates would not have had a material impact on   2016     third   quarter earnings. 
  Marketable equity investments, representing our investment in Temp Holdings, are stated at fair value and marked to market through stockholders  equity, net of tax.  Impairments in value below historical cost, if any, deemed to be other than temporary, would be expensed in the consolidated statement of earnings.  See the Fair Value Measurements footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
  
   33 

We are exposed to market risk as a result of our obligation to pay benefits under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and our related investments in company-owned variable universal life insurance policies.  The obligation to employees increases and decreases based on movements in the equity and debt markets.  The investments in mutual funds, as part of the company-owned variable universal life insurance policies, are designed to mitigate, but not eliminate, this risk with offsetting gains and losses. 
  Overall, our holdings and positions in market risk-sensitive instruments do not subject us to material risk. 
   
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 
  The Company is a party to a pending nationwide class action lawsuit entitled Hillson et.al. v Kelly Services.  The suit alleges that current and former temporary employees of Kelly Services are entitled to monetary damages for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act requirement that the notice and disclosure form provided to employees for purposes of conducting a background screening be a standalone document.  On April 20, 2016 the parties entered into a formal settlement agreement. The parties still must secure court approval of the settlement.  In light of amounts previously expensed and anticipated recoveries from third parties, Kelly recorded an accrual in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $4.1 million to reflect the expected cost of the tentative settlement. 
  The Company is continuously engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business, such as matters alleging employment discrimination, alleging wage and hour violations or enforcing the restrictive covenants in the Company s employment agreements.  The Company has recently experienced an increase in its litigation volume, including cases where claimants seek class action certification.  While there is no expectation that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainty and the Company is not able to reasonably predict if any matter will be resolved in a manner that is materially adverse to the Company.    
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
  There have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for year ended   January 3, 2016  . 
  
   34 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  (a) Sales of Equity Securities Not Registered Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 
  None. 
  (c) Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities 
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we reacquired shares of our Class A common stock as follows:   

  We may reacquire shares sold to cover taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock held by employees.  Accordingly,   72,733   shares were reacquired in transactions during the quarter.  
   
  Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures. 
  Not applicable.
