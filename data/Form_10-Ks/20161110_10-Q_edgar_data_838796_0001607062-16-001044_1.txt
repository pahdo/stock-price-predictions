SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The other information in these condensed
financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
of the results for the periods covered. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These
condensed financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. These condensed financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and additional information as contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.  

Nature
of Organization   

Kiwibox.Com,
Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 19, 1988 under the name Fortunistics, Inc.
On November 18, 1998, the Company changed its name to Magnitude Information Systems, Inc. On December 31,
2009, the Company changed its name to Kiwibox.com, Inc.  

On
August 16, 2007 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Kiwibox Media, Inc.  

The
Company, Magnitude, Inc. and Kiwibox Media Inc. were separate legal entities until December 31, 2009, with Kiwibox Media, Inc.
being a wholly owned subsidiary. On December 31, 2009, the two subsidiaries, Magnitude, Inc. and Kiwibox Media, Inc. merged into
the Company.  

On
September 30, 2011, Kiwibox.com acquired the German based social network Kwick! Community GmbH   Co. KG ( Kwick ),
a wholly-owned subsidiary.  

On
September 24, 2013, Kwick Community GmbH   Co. KG signed an equity purchase agreement to acquire Interscholz Internet Services
GmbH and Co KG, a German limited liability company, and all the equity of its general partner, Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH.
As of the balance sheet date, and pursuant to the terms of the contract, since full payment was not made for the purchase price
of Interscholz Internet Services GmbH   Co KG, ownership does not transfer to Kwick Community GmbH   Co KG. Full payment
must be made for ownership to transfer to Kwick. As of December 31, 2013 only $515,037 of the total purchase price of $1,352,000
was made. On December 9, 2013 the acquisition of Interscholz Internet Services GmbH and Co KG by Kwick was rescinded due to non
compliance with the terms of the addendum to the contract, calling for the full purchase price to have been paid. However, Kwick
did acquire all the equity of the general partner, Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH, as full payment was not a requirement for transfer
of ownership of that entity.  

On
December 10, 2013, the Company signed an Equity Purchase Agreement with Marcus Winkler to sell to him eighty (80%) percent of
the equity of its German subsidiary, KWICK! Community GmbH   Co. KG, a German limited liability company, and Kwick! Beteiligungs
GmbH, its general partner (collectively,  Kwick ). The sale was approved on December 18, 2013. Due to the fact that
the parent company ceased to have a controlling financial interest in Kwick, the subsidiary was deconsolidated from that date
forward. On December 30, 2013 a total of 15% of the remaining 20% of the equity of Kwick was transferred to the Chief Executive
Officer of Kwick (the  Kwick CEO ), in consideration for the Kwick CEO pledging to the bank 5,000 Euros as collateral,
on behalf of Kiwibox, for bank overdrafts incurred by  Kwick s  wholly-owned subsidiary Interscholz Beteiligungs
GmbH, as general partner (managing partner) for Interscholz Internet Services GmbH   Co KG; as it is the duty of the general/managing
partner to secure liquidity for the partnership. Since Kiwibox owned 20% of Kwick they were required, under German law, as managing
partner of Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH to secure liquidity for Interscholz Internet Services GmbH   Co KG. Therefore, 15%
of Kiwibox s 20% of Kwick was given to the Kwick CEO in exchange for the CEO pledging the necessary collateral. In addition
to the collateral given by the Kwick CEO, as new 15% shareholder of Kwick, the Kwick CEO also agreed to keep the Interscholz Beteiligungs
GmbH business going. This transfer was unanimously approved with written consent of the Board of Directors. Since the fair value
of Kiwibox s interest in Kwick is zero, this transaction had no material impact on the financial statements.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company accounts for cash and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash
equivalents.  

Depreciation
and Amortization   

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation on equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements is computed on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets between 3-10 years, or lease term for leasehold improvements,
if for a shorter period. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Software costs are amortized using the
straight line method and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization begins when the related software is ready for
its intended use in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350-40, Internal-Use Software, Subsequent
Measurement.  

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising expense was $4,700 and $7,200 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and $1,200 and $2,300 for the same periods in 2015, respectively.  

Evaluation
of Long Lived Assets   

Long-lived
assets are assessed for recoverability on an ongoing basis. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets,
their carrying value would be reduced by the excess, if any, of the long-lived asset over management s estimate of the anticipated
undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long-lived asset.  

Any
impairment of the Company s internally-developed software is recognized and measured in accordance with the provisions of
ASC 360-10-35,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, Internal-Use Software, Subsequent Measurement,  which requires that assets
be grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets. The guidance is applicable, for example, when one of the following events or changes in circumstances occurs
related to computer software being developed or currently in use indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable:  

a.      Internal-use
                                         computer software is not expected to provide substantive service potential.  

b.      A
                                         significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software is used or is
                                         expected to be used.  

c.      A
                                         significant change is made or will be made to the software program.  

d.      Costs
                                         of developing or modifying internal-use computer software significantly exceed the amount
                                         originally expected to develop or modify the software.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Under ASC 820, a framework was established for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
The Company accounted for certain convertible debentures issued in the year ended December 31, 2014 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 as derivative liabilities required to be bifurcated from the host contract in accordance with ASC 815-40,  Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity , as the conversion feature embedded in the convertible debentures could result in the note principal
and related accrued interest being converted to a variable number of the Company s common shares (see Note 13).   

Securities
Issued for Services   

The
Company accounts for stock, stock options and stock warrants issued for services and compensation by employees under the fair
value method. For non-employees, the fair market value of the Company s stock on the date of stock issuance or option/grant
is used. The Company has determined the fair market value of the warrants/options issued under the Black-Scholes Pricing Model.
The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , which establishes accounting
for equity instruments exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured
at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee's requisite service
period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant).  

Reclassification
of certain securities under ASC 815-15   

Pursuant
to ASC 815-15,  Contracts in Entity s own Equity , if a company has more than one contract subject to this Issue,
and partial reclassification is required, there may be different methods that could be used to determine which contracts, or portions
of contracts, should be reclassified. The Company's method for reclassification of such contracts is reclassification of contracts
with the latest maturity date first.  

Capitalization
of Software /Website development costs   

The
Company capitalizes outside-contracted development work in accordance with the guidelines published under ASC 350-50,  Website
Development Costs . Under ASC 350-50, costs incurred during the planning stage are expensed, while costs relating to software
used to operate a web site or for developing initial graphics should be accounted for under ASC 350-50,  Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use , unless a plan exists or is being developed to market the
software externally. Under ASC 350-50, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the
application development stage should be capitalized. Costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion
of old data by new systems should also be capitalized, excluding training costs.  

Fees
incurred for web site hosting, which involve the payment of a specified, periodic fee to an Internet service provider in return
for hosting the web site on its server(s) connected to the Internet, are expensed over the period of benefit, and included in
cost of sales in the accompanying financial statements.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company provides for income taxes based on enacted tax law and statutory tax rates at which items of income and expenses are expected
to be settled in the Company s income tax return. Certain items of revenue and expense are reported for Federal income tax
purposes in different periods than for financial reporting purposes, thereby resulting in deferred income taxes. Deferred taxes
are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has incurred net operating losses
for financial-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. Accordingly, for Federal and state income tax purposes, the benefit for income
taxes has been offset entirely by a valuation allowance against the related federal and state deferred tax asset. .  

Net
Loss Per Share   

Net
loss per share, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  is computed by dividing net loss
by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Common Stock equivalents have not been
included in this computation since the effect would be anti-dilutive. Such common stock equivalents totaled 82,841,799 common
shares at September 30, 2016, comprised of 5,000,000 shares issuable upon exercise of stock purchase warrants, 2,900,000 shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options, 729,537 shares exercisable upon conversion of convertible preferred shares, and 74,212,262
shares potentially issuable upon conversion of convertible debt. Such debt and the related accrued interest with principal totaling
$13,143,700 convertible at the option of four debt holders at a price of 50% of the average closing price for the preceding 10
days, would yield in excess of 43 billion shares if fully converted at September 30, 2016. However, the respective notes, all of
which were issued to these investors, carry a stipulation whereby the number of all shares issued pursuant to a conversion, may
in the aggregate not exceed a number that would increase the total share holdings beneficially owned by such investor to a level
above 9.99%. At the end of the period, this clause limits any conversion to the aforementioned number of shares. All of the aforementioned
conversions or exercises, as the case may be, are at the option of the holders.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company s revenue is derived from advertising on the Kiwibox.Com website. Most contracts require the Company to deliver
the customer impressions, click-throughs or new customers, or some combination thereof. Accordingly, advertising revenue is estimated
and recognized for the period in which customer impressions, click through or new customers are delivered. Licensing or hosting
revenue consists of an annual contract with clients to provide web-site hosting and assistance.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.   

2.
GOING CONCERN  

The
ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on increasing sales and obtaining additional capital and financing.
Our revenues during the foreseeable future are insufficient to finance our business and we are entirely dependent on the willingness
of existing investors to continue supporting the Company with working capital loans and equity investments, and our ability to
find new investors should the financial support from existing investors prove to be insufficient. If we were unable to obtain
a steady flow of new debt or equity-based working capital we would be forced to cease operations. In their report for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, our auditors had expressed an opinion that, as a result of the losses incurred, there was substantial
doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern. Management s plans are to continue seeking
equity and debt capital until cash flow from operations cover funding needs.  

3.
CONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK  

The
Company maintains cash balances in a financial institution which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to
$250,000. Balances in these accounts may, at times, exceed the federally insured limits. At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, cash balances in bank accounts did not exceed this limit. The Company provides credit in the normal course of business to
customers located throughout the U.S. and overseas. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other
information.  

4.
PREPAID EXPENSES  

Prepaid
expenses consist of the following at:  

5.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property
and equipment consist of the following at:  

Depreciation
expense charged to operations was $1,557 and $3,159 in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

6.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

Amortization
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $0, respectively.  

7.
INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY  

On
December 10, 2013, the company signed an equity purchase agreement with Marcus Winkler to sell to him eighty (80%) percent of
the equity of its German subsidiary, Kwick. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the purchaser paid 36,000 Euros as the purchase
price and the company was required to obtain shareholder approval of the sale as required under applicable Delaware Law. The majority
shareholder approval was obtained on December 18, 2013. In addition, the Company and Mr. Winkler signed a Lock-Up and Standstill
Agreement pursuant to the general terms of which the Company agreed not to participate in the management, operations or finances
of Kwick, which shall be exclusively managed and under control of the purchaser. Accordingly, the Company s minority ownership
position shall be subject, in all respects, to the exclusive control of the purchaser. Mr. Winkler also has investment and voting
control over Kreuzfeld Ltd., a major creditor of the company, which holds a Class AA convertible promissory note with an outstanding
balance (including accrued interest) of $6,200,485 as of September 30, 2016.  

7.
INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY (continued)  

On
December 30, 2013 a total of 15% of the remaining 20% of the equity of Kwick was transferred to the Chief Executive Officer of
Kwick (the  Kwick CEO ), in consideration for the Kwick CEO pledging to the bank 5,000 Euros as collateral, on behalf
of Kiwibox, for bank overdrafts incurred by  Kwick s  wholly-owned subsidiary Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH,
as general partner (managing partner) for Interscholz Internet Services GmbH   Co KG: as it is the duty of the general partner/managing
partner to secure liquidity for the partnership. Since Kiwibox owned 20% of Kwick they were required, under German law, as managing
partner of Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH to secure liquidity for Interscholz Internet Services GmbH   Co KG. Therefore, 15%
of Kiwibox s 20% was given to the Kwick CEO in exchange for the CEO pledging the necessary collateral. In addition to the
collateral given by the Kwick CEO, as new 15% shareholder of Kwick, the Kwick CEO also agreed to keep the Interscholz Beteiligungs
GmbH business going. This transfer was unanimously approved with written consent of the Board of Directors. Since the fair value
of Kiwibox s interest in Kwick is zero, this transaction had no material impact on the financial statements.  

Due
to the significant reductions in fair value of this reporting unit that were considered other than temporary, and impairment of
the related goodwill, the carrying value of this cost method investment was zero at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.

                                         imputed interest rate used to discount the note is 8% per annum. This obligation is in

      $               

13.
DERIVATIVE CONVERSION FEATURES  

On
July 27, 2010, the Company issued two Class A Senior Convertible Revolving Promissory Notes ( Class A Notes ), one
to Cambridge Services, Inc., in the principal amount of $683,996 consolidating the series of loans (and related accrued interest)
made to the Company since June 26, 2009, and one to Discover Advisory Company, in the principal amount of $1,160,984, consolidating
the series of loans (and related accrued interest) made to the Company since September 19, 2008 and including advances through
September 30, 2010. Each of these promissory notes are due on demand, accrue interest at the rate of 10%, per annum, are convertible
(including accrued interest) at the option of each lender into Common Stock of the Company at 50% of the averaged ten closing
prices for the Company's Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the Conversion Date but in no event
less than $0.001 (the  Conversion Price ). Both promissory notes contain conversion caps, limiting conversions under
these notes to a maximum beneficial ownership position of Company common stock to 9.99% for each lender. Each of these notes contains
Company covenants, requiring the lenders  prior written consent in order for the Company to merge, issue any common or preferred
stock or any convertible debt instruments, declare a stock split or dividends, increase any compensation to its officers or directors
by more than five (5%) during any calendar year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 no debt was converted.  

The
Company renegotiated certain outstanding promissory notes with its four major creditors, Discover Advisory Company of the Bahamas
( DAC ), Kreuzfeld Ltd. of Switzerland ( Kreuzfeld ), Cambridge Services, Inc. of Panama ( CSI )
and Vermoegensverwaltungs-Gesellschaft Zurich LTD of Switzerland ( VGZ ). As of August 1, 2012, the Company authorized
the issue of a new series of corporate notes, the Class AA Senior Secured Convertible Revolving Promissory Notes, dated as of
August 1, 2012 (the New Note(s) ) and issued New Notes: (1) to DAC, with a maximum credit facility of $5,000,000 which replaced
the Company s outstanding Class A Senior Convertible Revolving Promissory Note, dated July 27, 2010, in the original principal
amount of $1,080,984, now cancelled, which had an outstanding balance due (including accrued interest) of $5,915,726 as of December
31, 2015 and $6,663,217 at September 30, 2016; (2) to Kreuzfeld, with a maximum credit facility of $5,000,000 which replaced the
Company s outstanding Class A Senior Convertible Revolving Promissory Note, dated September 16, 2011, in the original principal
amount of $2,000,000, now cancelled, which had an outstanding balance due (including accrued interest) of $5,490,657 at December
31, 2015 and $6,200,485 at September 30, 2016; (3) to CSI, with a maximum credit facility of $2,000,000 which replaced the Company s
outstanding Class A Senior Convertible Revolving Promissory Note, dated August 1, 2011, in the original principal amount of $1,303,996,
now cancelled, with an outstanding balance due (including accrued interest) of $4,040,407 as of December 31, 2015, and $4,269,917
at September 30, 2016 and; (4) to VGZ, with a maximum credit facility of $2,000,000 which replaced the Company s outstanding
Class A Senior Convertible Revolving Promissory Note, dated September 30, 2010, in the original principal amount of $2,000,000,
now cancelled, with an outstanding balance due (including accrued interest) of $1,109,550 as of December 31, 2015 and $1,167,342
at September 30, 2016. All of the New Notes accrue interest at the rate of 10%, are convertible into common shares at the conversion
rate equal to 50% of the averaged ten closing prices for the Company's Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days immediately
preceding the Conversion Date but in no event less than $0.001, and are due on demand.. Pursuant to an Equity and Stock Pledge
Agreement, also negotiated and executed as of August 1, 2012, the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness of the New Notes is
secured by all of the limited partnership interests of the Company s partly-owned (now deconsolidated) German subsidiary,
KWICK! Community GmbH   Co. KG, a private German limited partnership ( KG ), and all of its shares of the sole
general partner of KG, KWICK! Community Beteiligungs GmbH.

DERIVATIVE CONVERSION FEATURES (Continued)  

The
Company accounted for the conversion features underlying these convertible debentures in accordance with ASC 815-40,  Contract
in Entity s Own Equity , as the conversion feature embedded in the convertible debentures could result in the note principal
and related accrued interest being converted to a variable number of the Company s common shares. The Company determined
the value of the derivate conversion features of new debentures issued to these holders plus accrued interest during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 under these terms at the relevant commitment dates to be $1,825,224 utilizing a Black-Scholes
valuation model. The change in fair value of the liability for the conversion feature resulted in income of $119,223 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, which is included in Other Income (Expense) in the accompanying financial statements. The fair
value of these derivative conversion features was determined to be $18,302,382 at September 30, 2016.

15.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold advertising space on its Kiwibox.com website to Kwick totaling $8,789,
which is included in the Accounts Receivable balance due from Kwick of $60,687 at September, 2016. Kwick is majority-owned by

FAIR VALUE  

Some
of the Company s financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that
approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables.  

Effective
July 1 2009, the Company adopted ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . This topic defines fair value for certain
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance supersedes all other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements. The Company accounted for the conversion features underlying certain convertible debentures
in accordance with ASC 815-40,  Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , as the conversion feature embedded in the convertible
debentures could result in the note principal and related accrued interest being converted to a variable number of the Company s
common shares.  

Effective
July 1 2009, the Company adopted ASC 820-10-55-23A,  Scope Application to Certain Non-Financial Assets and Certain Non-Financial
Liabilities , delaying application for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities as permitted. ASC 820 establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:  

Level
1   quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access as of the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange- traded
securities and exchange-based derivatives.  

Level
2   inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly
observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include
fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds, and fair-value hedges.  

Level
3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently- traded, non-exchange-based
derivatives and commingled investment funds and are measured using present value pricing models. The company values the conversion
liabilities using the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions are updated using independent data such as the risk free rate, volatility
and expected life for each valuation date based on changes over time.   

  The
following tables reconciles, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the beginning and ending balances for financial instruments
that are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements (all Level 4):  

The
fair value of the conversion features are calculated at the time of issuance and the Company records a conversion liability for
the calculated value. The Company recognizes interest expense for the recognition of the conversion liability.  

For
2016, the fair value of the embedded conversion liabilities was determined using the Black-Scholes model calculating fair value
based on the conversion discount as well as the term and short-term bond rate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016
the following assumptions were used: (1) conversion discounts of 50%; (2) a look back period of 10 days (3) bond rates of 0.17%
to 0.28% and (4) volatility range of 55% to 574%.  

Fluctuation
in value is largely based on the change in the daily share price accompanied by the conversion discount. The change in volatility
has the greater effect on the conversion liability during each reporting period, as higher volatility levels will yield larger
values.  

17.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

During
October 2016 and through November 7, 2016 we received $80,000 of working capital from accredited investors, which are covered
by convertible promissory notes.

RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ),
which requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred
to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to the first
quarter of 2018 to provide companies sufficient time to implement the standards. Early adoption will be permitted, but not before
the first quarter of 2017. Adoption can occur using one of two prescribed transition methods. In March and April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net)  and ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing 
which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASC 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 must be adopted concurrently
with the adoption of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these new standards.  

In
June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting
for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service
Period. A performance target in a share-based payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service
period should be accounted for as a performance condition under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation - Stock
Compensation. As a result, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award s grant date fair value. Compensation
cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.
The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of this standard, but it did not have a material effect on its
results of operations.  

On
August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concerns (Subtopic
205-40): Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that
are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt,
(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating
effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated,
and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to
be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.  

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid
in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.  This ASU provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software
license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting of other
software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. This
ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. The Company
adopted the provisions of this standard, but it did not have a material effect on its results of operations.  

During
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The standard requires lessees
to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months
on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. ASU 2016-02
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ).
ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic
entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification
in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
standard and the impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force , ( ASU 2016-15 ). The
purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain  cash receipts
and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective transition method should be used in
the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. If retrospective application is considered impracticable, retrospective
application may be used as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its condensed consolidated financial statements .   

We
have reviewed all FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof
that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new
pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles
will have a material impact on the corporation s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability
of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.  

Management
does not believe there would have been a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements had any other recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards been adopted in the current period.

Description
of Business    

Overview  

We
own and operate  Kiwibox.com , a social networking website. Initially launched in 1999, Kiwibox.com is a social network.  

Kiwibox
Operations  

Kiwibox.com
is a social network for young adults all around the world for web and mobile usage, a community to find new friends and to meet
new people online and in the real world. Unlike traditional social networking sites such as Facebook, Kiwibox combines its own
 magazine  content and social networking technology in its website, creating attractive topics for its membership to
peruse and enjoy.  

Our
operating expenses, not including stock-based compensation, are at a level of approximately $110,000 per month (see sections  Loans
and Notes Payable ).  

Potential
Revenue Streams and Marketing Strategy  

Currently
we generate all of our revenue from advertising/sponsorships. We anticipate revenue growth from increased membership activity
and our revitalized website as we continue to implement new marketing strategies. Our software and networking technologies that
we incorporated during the last 4 years now permit our mobile devices to accept and receive direct advertising. Our social networks
permit us to work with potential advertisers to identify the right member groups for direct target advertising, a marketing channel
that is readily accessible to our social media community.  

Our
continuing membership growth is fueled by infiltrating our users into local event venues where they participate and simultaneously
communicate with our social network via the regular deployment of our cutting-edge App updates. As a result, the Kiwibox network
enjoys continuing user sign-ups and continuing loyalty of users to our social network.  

Community
means social network   and thrives on membership networking. Our website is based on the latest web technology which makes
it easier for users to stay connected and to interact with each other.  

The
results of our marketing efforts clearly show the following positive trends in the growth of our community at September 30, 2016:

Unique
                                         Mobile Visitors   We had approximately 960,000 Unique Mobile Visitors during the
                                         third quarter of 2016; this statistic was not counted in earlier years.  

Market
Position  

Our
social media s market penetration continues to rely upon our innovations where we strive to enhance our member s experiences
with our community. Our members enjoy our interactive platforms where we blog, play games, chat and share pictures.  

The
Kiwibox Network is in a unique position because it combines the excitement of a dating community with the benefits and accessibility
of a real social network. This community behavior binds users to the platform and is the base for our viral marketing.  

  Safety  

Kiwibox.com
has developed an effective monitoring model which assists in maintaining a safe site for our member base, combining both technology
based systems and user moderation. Users communicate and share information in an environment where they feel both secure and at
ease. Members of the Kiwibox team monitor forums, postings, profiles and groups daily to ensure the content is appropriate.  

Competition  

Our
primary competitors are other online social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, Tinder and Tumbler. Facebook is widely considered
as the industry leaders, however, recently statistics and strategic announcements have indicated a shift in the target audience
from teens and college students to a much broader and more adult demographic, because of their international focus. We plan to
distinguish ourselves by targeting the US-market and by combining the social-network advantages with user generated content  
from users to users, while stressing the community feeling.  

Technology
Development  

The Company attaches great importance to its
innovative technology developments and continues to follow the top social network market leaders with technology upgrades, providing
its users with an alternative social networking opportunity. 

The Kiwibox Network
is focusing on the fast growing mobile usage phenomenon, being online with friends all the time and everywhere. At present, more
than 960,000 company Apps are installed worldwide. 

New Kiwibox  Meet and Date  App 

In addition to our free platform, Kiwibox
introduced, and is to release, a membership based flirting/dating platform in the next few months. The development is now in its
last steps. 

Intellectual
Property  

The
Kiwibox.com web and mobile software and other related intellectual property rights are important assets. Most of our software
is unique and individual and developed internally.  

Governmental
Regulations  

Our
Kiwibox website operations are subject to state, federal and international laws, rules and regulations that cover on-line business,
privacy policies, consumer protection and product marketing. The Kiwibox website business is subject to state, federal and international
laws, rules and regulations applicable to online commerce, including user privacy policies, product pricing policies, website
content and general consumer protection laws.  Various laws, rules and regulations have been adopted, and probably will be
adopted in the future, that apply to the Internet, including available online content, privacy concerns, online marketing,  spam 
and unsolicited commercial email, taxation issues, and regulations that effect and monitor the quality of products and services.    

A
portion of these laws, rules and regulations that concern the Internet and its uses have been only recently adopted. Courts and
administrative agencies have not yet fully interpreted these legal requirements as to their application and scope. Accordingly,
our Kiwibox website business is subject to the uncertainties of future interpretations and application of these legal requirements.
The application and interpretation of these legal requirements or the passage of new and/or revised laws, rules and regulations
could reduce the demand for Kiwibox website services, increase its operational costs, and expose it to potential liability. Any
such events could have a material adverse effect upon our Kiwibox website business and financial condition. Our failure, or that
of our business partners, to accurately predict and anticipate the interpretation or application of these laws, rules and regulations,
whether now in force or adopted in the future, could have a detrimental impact on our operations, create negative publicity for
us and expose us to potential liability.  

State
and federal agencies are applying consumer protection laws to regulate the on-line use, collection and dissemination of personal
information and website content. These laws require us to implement programs to notify our website users of our privacy and security
programs. Consumer protection laws will require us to obtain the consent of our website users if we want to collect and use certain
portions of their personal information.  

The
Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is the lead federal agency monitoring Internet websites and their content. State
attorneys general have become active monitors of the Internet at the local State level. These governmental bodies may investigate
or bring enforcement actions against website operators they deem in violation of applicable consumer protection laws. We believe
that our Kiwibox website s collection and dissemination of information programs, including our privacy policies, do and
will continue to comply with existing laws. However, a decision by a federal or state agency that any of our Kiwibox website s
business practices do not meet applicable legal standards could result in liability and have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial condition.

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015     

  For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues amounted to $3,089 and $8,789, respectively compared to $5,843
and $20,139 recorded in the same periods in 2015. All revenue was received from our affiliate Kwick.   

  Gross
Profit (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $(1,611) and $1,439, respectively, after accounting
for $4,700 and $7,350 respectively, in cost of sales. After deducting selling and general and administrative expenses of $407,733
and $1,000,465 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $291,636 and $865,690 recorded in the same
periods in 2015, the Company realized operating losses of $409,344 and $999,026 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to operating losses of $292,896 and $853,969 in the same periods in 2015.  

  The
major item included in non-operating income and expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was a charge of
$585,298 and $1,825,224 respectively, accounting for the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature associated with
convertible debt. We also had income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $216,152 and $119,223, respectively,
in connection with changes in the valuation of derivative liabilities.  

  The
quarter concluded with a net loss of $1,114,360 for the quarter and net loss of $3,687,409 for the first nine months of 2016.
After accounting for dividends accrued on outstanding preferred stock which totaled $38,447, the net loss applicable to common
shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,725,856 or $0.005 per share compared to a net loss applicable
to common shareholders of $3,227,835 or $0.005 per share for the same period in 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources      

  We
have financed our business with new debt since our cash flow is insufficient to provide the working capital necessary to fund
our operations. We received $328,320 in cash from short-term loans from accredited private investors during the quarter.   We
have an ongoing and urgent need for working capital to fund our operations. If we are unable to continue to receive new equity
investments or obtain loans, we will not be able to fund our operations and we will be required to close our business.      

  Our
deficit in working capital amounted to $38,973,433 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $33,250,110 at December 31, 2015. Stockholders 
equity showed an impairment of $38,956,353 at the end of the period, compared to an impairment of $35,235,057 at the beginning
of the year. The negative cash flow from operations during the nine months totaled $878,717 and was financed by new debt.  

  The
Company had $0 of bank debt as of September 30, 2016. Aside from trade payables and accruals, our remaining indebtedness at September
30, 2016 consisted of certain notes and loans aggregating $13,662,020, liabilities for derivative conversion features of $18,302,382,
amounts due to related parties of $131,216 and the following obligations. The position  Obligations to be settled in stock 
of $288,898 accounts for common shares due under consulting agreements, and for services to be settled in common stock options
and warrants, where the underlying securities had not yet been issued. Current liabilities also include $825,366 accrued unpaid
dividends on outstanding preferred stock. Such dividends will be paid only if and when capital surplus and cash-flow from operations
are sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts without thereby unduly impacting the Company s ability to continue operating
and growing its business.  

  Our
current cash reserves and net cash flow from operations expected during the near future will be insufficient to fund our operations
and website development and marketing plan over the next twelve months. We expect to fund these requirements with further investments
in form of debt or equity capital and are in ongoing discussions with existing investors to secure funding. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be able to secure needed financing in the future and identify a financing source or sources, and if we do,
whether the terms of such financing will be acceptable or commercially reasonable.  

  Absent
the receipt of   needed equity investment or loans, we will be compelled to severely curtail operations and possibly, close
our business operations. Assuming we can receive current funds to continue to operate our businesses, we may need additional funding
for marketing and website development, absent of which our website development, results of operations and financial condition
could be subject to material adverse consequences   .

ITEM
4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

   (a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

  The
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the fiscal period ended September
30, 2016 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer has concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  

As
of September 30, 2016, management assessed, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control  
Integrated Framework for effective internal control over financial reporting established in  Internal Control--Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) and SEC guidance on conducting
such assessments.  Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal
controls and procedures were not effective as more fully described below.  Based on management s assessment over
financial reporting, management believes as of September 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting
was not effective due to the following deficiencies:   

  1.
The Company s control environment did not have adequate segregation of duties and lacked adequate accounting resources to
address non routine and complex transactions and financial reporting matters on a timely basis.   

  2.
Effective May 31, 2015 the chief financial officer resigned and the CEO Andre Scholz took over the position as chief financial
officer while the comptroller that was assisting the previous part time chief financial officer assumed the day to day transactional
activity.  

Company
management believes that notwithstanding the above identified deficiencies that constitute our material weakness, that the financial
statements fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.   

  Management s
Remediation Initiatives  

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:   

-      When
                                         available, we will devote additional resources to supplement, where necessary, existing
                                         resources with additional qualified third party consultants;  

-      We
                                         are continuing to institute more stringent approval processes for financial transactions,
                                         and  

-      We
                                         are continuing to perform additional procedures and analyses for significant transactions
                                         as a mitigating control in the control environment due to segregation of duties issues.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

Other
than as stated above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.
