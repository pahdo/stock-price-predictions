   EXPLANATORY NOTE   
     
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation and Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to the  Operating Partnership  mean Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and references to the  General Partner  mean Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation and real estate investment trust ( REIT ), and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. References to the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  mean collectively the General Partner, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by the General Partner.  
     
  The Operating Partnership conducts the business of providing leasing, management, acquisition, development, construction and tenant-related services for its General Partner.  The Operating Partnership, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, including the Mack-Cali property-owning partnerships and limited liability companies is the entity through which all of the General Partner s operations are conducted.  The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the General Partner owned an approximate 89.5 percent common unit interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 10.5 percent common unit interest is owned by limited partners.  The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are (1) persons who contributed their interests in properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common units (each, a  Common Unit ) or preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or (2) recipients of long term incentive plan units of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the General Partner s executive compensation plans.  
     
  A Common Unit of the Operating Partnership and a share of common stock of the General Partner (the  Common Stock ) have substantially the same economic characteristics in as much as they effectively share equally in the net income or loss of the Company.  The General Partner owns a number of common units of the Operating Partnership equal to the number of issued and outstanding shares of the General Partner s common stock.  Common unitholders (other than the General Partner) have the right to redeem their Common Units, subject to certain restrictions under the Seconded Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended (the  Partnership Agreement ) and agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance.  The redemption is required to be satisfied in shares of Common Stock of the General Partner, cash, or a combination thereof, calculated as follows:  one share of the General Partner s Common Stock, or cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the General Partner s Common Stock at the time of redemption, for each Common Unit.  The General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines the form of redemption of Common Units (i.e., whether a common unitholder receives Common Stock of the General Partner, cash, or any combination thereof).  If the General Partner elects to satisfy the redemption with shares of Common Stock of the General Partner as opposed to cash, the General Partner is obligated to issue shares of its Common Stock to the redeeming unitholder.  Regardless of the rights described above, the common unitholders may not put their units for cash to the Company or the General Partner under any circumstances.  With each such redemption, the General Partner s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever the General Partner issues shares of its Common Stock other than to acquire Common Units, the General Partner must contribute any net proceeds it receives to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership must issue to the General Partner an equivalent number of Common Units. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.  
     
  The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the General Partner and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:  
     
                enhance investors  understanding of the General Partner and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business of the Company; 
     
                eliminate duplicative disclosure and provide a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the General Partner and the Operating Partnership; and 
     
                create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
     
  The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between the General Partner and the Operating Partnership in the context of how they operate as a consolidated company.  The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the General Partner.  The General Partner does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its interests in the Operating Partnership, nor does the Operating Partnership have employees of its   
     
 2   

Table of Contents   
     
  own.  The Operating Partnership, not the General Partner, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of the General Partner.  The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the General Partner, including ownership interests in joint ventures.  The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity.  Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by the General Partner, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in consideration of common or preferred units in the Operating Partnership, as applicable, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan facility, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from the disposition of properties and joint ventures.  
     
  Shareholders  equity, partners  capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the General Partner and the Operating Partnership.  The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners  capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements as is the General Partner s interest in the Operating Partnership.  The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements comprise the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships and development joint venture partners.  The noncontrolling interests in the General Partner s financial statements are the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership s level and include limited partners of the Operating Partnership.  The differences between shareholders  equity and partners  capital result from differences in the equity issued at the General Partner and Operating Partnership levels.  
     
  To help investors better understand the key differences between the General Partner and the Operating Partnership, certain information for the General Partner and the Operating Partnership in this report has been separated, as set forth below:

   1.                    ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
   ORGANIZATION   
     
  Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  General Partner ) is a fully-integrated self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ). The General Partner controls Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Operating Partnership ), as its sole general partner and owned an 89.5 percent common unit interest in the Operating Partnership as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The General Partner s business is the ownership of interests in and operation of the Operating Partnership and all of the General Partner s expenses are incurred for the benefit of the Operating Partnership.  The General Partner is reimbursed by the Operating Partnership for all expenses it incurs relating to the ownership and operation of the Operating Partnership.  
     
  The Operating Partnership conducts the business of providing leasing, management, acquisition, development, construction and tenant-related services for its General Partner.  The Operating Partnership, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, including the Mack-Cali property-owning partnerships and limited liability companies, is the entity through which all of the General Partner s operations are conducted.  Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the  Company  refers to the General Partner and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned or had interests in 263 properties, consisting of 136 office and 110 flex properties, totaling approximately 29.0 million square feet, leased to approximately 1,800 commercial tenants, and 17 multi-family rental properties containing 5,214 residential units, plus developable land (collectively, the  Properties ).  The Properties are comprised of 136 office buildings totaling approximately 23.7 million square feet (which include 36 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.6 million square feet owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests), 94 office/flex buildings totaling approximately 4.8 million square feet, six industrial/warehouse buildings totaling approximately 387,400 square feet, 17 multi-family properties totaling 5,214 apartments (which include ten properties aggregating 3,587 apartments owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests), six parking/retail properties totaling approximately 130,100 square feet (which include two buildings aggregating 81,700 square feet owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests), one hotel (which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company has an investment interest) and three parcels of land leased to others.  The Properties are located in seven states, primarily in the Northeast, plus the District of Columbia.  
     
   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, which consist principally of the Operating Partnership and variable interest entities for which the Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary, if any.  See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies   Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, for the Company s treatment of unconsolidated joint venture interests.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
     
   Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810, Consolidation, provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities  or  VIEs ) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIEs. Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack  (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and substantially all of the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest.  The Company consolidates VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance: and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the VIE that would be significant to the VIE.  
     
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted accounting guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, modifying the analysis it must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities or voting interest model entities.  The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model.  Under the revised guidance, the Operating Partnership will be a variable interest entity of the parent company, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.  As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the balance sheets of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, the identification of this entity as a variable interest entity has no impact on the  
     
 16   

Table of Contents   
     
  consolidated financial statements of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.  There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s investments in consolidated real estate joint ventures, which are variable interest entities in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have total real estate assets of $193.1 million and $273.4 million, respectively, mortgages of $70.1 million and $89.5 million, respectively, and other liabilities of $20.7 million and $17.5 million, respectively.  
     
  The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates and assumptions are based on management s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.  
     
  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in order to conform with current period presentation.  
     
   2.                    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
    Rental    
    Property                                                                             Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Costs directly related to the acquisition, development and construction of rental properties are capitalized.  Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.  Capitalized development and construction costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development and construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development.  Capitalized development and construction salaries and related costs approximated $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.9 million and $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Included in total rental property is construction, tenant improvement and development in-progress of $301 million and $88.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred; major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.  Fully-depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. 
     
  The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity (as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup).  If portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants, or held available for occupancy, and other portions have not yet reached that stage, the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project.  The Company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy, primarily based on a percentage of the relative square footage of each portion, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction.  
     
  Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Leasehold interests        

Remaining lease term            

Buildings and improvements       

5 to 40 years           

Tenant improvements       

The shorter of the term   of the related lease or useful life           

Furniture, fixtures and equipment       

5 to 10 years              
     
  Upon acquisition of rental property, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below-market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships.  The Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values.  The Company records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed differ from the purchase consideration of a transaction.  
     
 17   

Table of Contents   
     
  In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information.  The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.  
     
  Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases.  
     
  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall relationship with the respective tenant.  Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases.  In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions.  In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.  Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Company s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals.  The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases.  The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships.  
     
  On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company s rental properties held for use may be impaired.  In addition to identifying any specific circumstances which may affect a property or properties, management considers other criteria for determining which properties may require assessment for potential impairment.  The criteria considered by management include reviewing low leased percentages, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, near-term mortgage debt maturities or other factors that might impact the Company s intent and ability to hold the property.  A property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the fair value of the property.  The Company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions.  These assumptions are generally based on management s experience in its local real estate markets and the effects of current market conditions.  The assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property.  As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved, and actual losses or impairments may be realized in the future.  
     
    Rental Property    
    Held for Sale                                                    When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets.  The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, and there are no significant contingencies relating to the sale.  If, in management s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established. 
     
  If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as held and used.  A property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the property was  
     
 18   

Table of Contents   
     
  classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.  
     
    Investments in    
    Unconsolidated    
    Joint Ventures                                            The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting.  The Company applies the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions.  The outside basis portion of the Company s joint ventures is amortized over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying ventures  tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Generally, the Company would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Company has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee.  If the venture subsequently generates income, the Company only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. 
     
  If the venture subsequently makes distributions and the Company does not have an implied or actual commitment to support the operations of the venture, including a general partner interest in the investee, the Company will not record a basis less than zero, rather such amounts will be recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.  
     
  On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.  An investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.  To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the value of the investment.  The Company s estimates of value for each investment (particularly in real estate joint ventures) are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs.  As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future.  See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  
     
    Cash and Cash    
    Equivalents                                                           All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. 
     
    Deferred    
    Financing Costs                                  Costs incurred in obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. Deferred financing costs are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability to which they relate, except deferred financing costs related to the revolving credit facility, which are presented in deferred charges, goodwill and other assets.  In all cases, amortization of such costs is included in interest expense and was $1,234,000 and $945,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3,583,000 and $2,846,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  If a financing obligation is extinguished early, any unamortized deferred financing costs are written off and included in gains (losses) from extinguishment of debt.  Included in loss from extinguishment of debt, net of gains, of $19.3 million and $6.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were unamortized deferred financing costs which were written off of $346,000 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     
    Deferred    
    Leasing Costs                                                Costs incurred in connection with commercial leases are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases and included in depreciation and amortization.  Unamortized deferred leasing costs are charged to amortization expense upon early termination of the lease.  Certain employees of the Company are compensated for providing leasing services to the Properties.  The portion of such compensation related to commercial leases, which is capitalized and amortized, and included in deferred charges, goodwill and other assets, net, was approximately $790,000 and $922,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $2,440,000 and $2,738,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
     
    Goodwill                                                                          Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, as applicable.  Each of the Company s segments consists of a reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized.  Management performs an annual impairment test for goodwill during the fourth quarter and between annual tests, management evaluates the 
     
 19   

Table of Contents   
     
  recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  In its impairment tests of goodwill, management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If, based on this assessment, management determines that the fair value of the reporting unit is not less than its carrying value, then performing the additional two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized.  
     
    Derivative    
    Instruments                                                            The Company measures derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, at fair value and records them as an asset or liability, depending on the Company s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract.  For derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings.  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the affected period. 
     
    Revenue    
    Recognition                                                         Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases.  Unbilled rents receivable represents the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. 
     
  Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases.  The capitalized above-market lease values for acquired properties are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases.  
     
  Escalations and recoveries from tenants are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements.  These costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and other recoverable costs.  See Note 14: Tenant Leases.  
     
  Real estate services revenue includes property management, development, construction and leasing commission fees and other services, and payroll and related costs reimbursed from clients.  Fee income derived from the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures (which are capitalized by such ventures) are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated ownership interests.  
     
  Parking income includes income from parking spaces leased to tenants and others.  
     
  Other income includes income from tenants for additional services arranged for by the Company and income from tenants for early lease terminations.  
     
    Allowance for    
    Doubtful Accounts                      Management performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if an allowance for doubtful accounts is required based on factors affecting the collectability of the accounts receivable balances.  The factors considered by management in determining which individual tenant receivable balances, or aggregate receivable balances, require a collectability allowance include the age of the receivable, the tenant s payment history, the nature of the charges, any communications regarding the charges and other related information.  Management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of collection losses, which affects the allowance and net income. 
     
    Income and    
    Other Taxes                                                          The General Partner has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).  As a REIT, the General Partner generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax (including alternative minimum tax) on net income that it currently distributes to 
     
 20   

Table of Contents   
     
  its shareholders, provided that the General Partner satisfies certain organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income (determined by excluding any net capital gains) to its shareholders.  If and to the extent the General Partner retains and does not distribute any net capital gains, the General Partner will be required to pay federal, state and local taxes, as applicable, on such net capital gains at the rate applicable to capital gains of a corporation.  
     
  The Operating Partnership is a partnership, and, as a result, all income and losses of the partnership are allocated to the partners for inclusion in their respective tax returns.  Accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements.  
     
  The Company has elected to treat certain of its corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a  TRS ).  In general, a TRS of the Company may perform additional services for tenants of the Company and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the providing to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated).  A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax.   The Company has conducted business through its TRS entities for certain property management, development, construction and other related services, as well as to hold a joint venture interest in a hotel and other matters.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset related to its TRS activity with a balance of approximately $21.8 million which has been fully reserved for through a valuation allowance.  If the General Partner fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the General Partner will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.  The General Partner is subject to certain state and local taxes.  
     
  Pursuant to the amended provisions related to uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognized no material adjustments regarding its tax accounting treatment.  The Company expects to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense, which is included in general and administrative expense.  
     
  In the normal course of business, the Company or one of its subsidiaries is subject to examination by federal, state and local jurisdictions in which it operates, where applicable.  As of September 30, 2016, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations are generally from the year 2011 forward.  
     
    Earnings    
    Per Share    
    or Unit                                                                                      The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share or unit ( EPS or EPU ).  Basic EPS or EPU excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders or unitholders by the weighted average number of shares or units outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS or EPU reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS or EPU from continuing operations amount.  Shares or Units whose issuance is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions shall be considered outstanding and included in the computation of diluted EPS or EPU as follows (i) if all necessary conditions have been satisfied by the end of the period (the events have occurred), those shares or units shall be included as of the beginning of the period in which the conditions were satisfied (or as of the date of the grant, if later) or (ii) if all necessary conditions have not been satisfied by the end of the period, the number of contingently issuable shares or units included in diluted EPS or EPU shall be based on the number of shares or units, if any, that would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period (for example, the number of shares or units that would be issuable based on current period earnings or period-end market price) and if the result would be dilutive. Those contingently issuable shares or units shall be included in the denominator of diluted EPS or EPU as of the beginning of the period (or as of the date of the grant, if later).

  unit distributions of $0.15 per common share and unit were approved by the General Partner s Board of Directors on September 27, 2016 and paid on October 14, 2016.  
     
  The dividends and distributions payable at December 31, 2015 represents dividends payable to common shareholders (89,584,008 shares) and distributions payable to noncontrolling interest common unitholders of the Operating Partnership (10,516,844 common units) for all such holders of record as of January 6, 2016 with respect to the fourth quarter 2015.  The fourth quarter 2015 common stock dividends and common unit distributions of $0.15 per common share and unit were approved by the General Partner s Board of Directors on December 8, 2015 and paid on January 15, 2016.

    Stock    
    Compensation                                             The Company accounts for stock compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.  These provisions require that the estimated fair value of restricted stock ( Restricted Stock Awards ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance share units ( PSUs ), long-term incentive plan awards and stock options at the grant date be amortized ratably into expense over the appropriate vesting period.  The Company recorded stock compensation expense of $2,046,000 and $695,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4,299,000 and $1,500,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

    Income (Loss)                                                Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that are recorded in equity, such as effective portions of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges or unrealized holding gains or losses on marketable securities available for sale. 
     
    Fair Value    
    Hierarchy                                                                     The standard Fair Value Measurements specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs).  The following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: 
     
                        Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
                        Level 2: Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals and 
                        Level 3: Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
     
  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  
     
    Discontinued    
    Operations                                                                In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operation and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity.  This guidance defines a discontinued operation as a component or group of components disposed or classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and final result; the guidance states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area of operations, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity.  The guidance also provides for additional disclosure requirements in connection with both discontinued operations and other 
     
 22   

Table of Contents   
     
  dispositions not qualifying as discontinued operations.  The guidance is effective for all companies for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.  The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date.  The Company adopted this standard effective with the interim period beginning January 1, 2014.  Prior to January 1, 2014, properties identified as held for sale and/or disposed of were presented in discontinued operations.

    Standards                                                                     In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.  Additionally, this guidance requires improved disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, modifying the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors).  The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.  This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.  A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for in the same manner as operating leases today.  The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.  The guidance is expected to impact the consolidated financial statements as the Company has certain operating and land lease arrangements for which it is the lessee.  The guidance supersedes previously issued guidance under ASC Topic 840  Leases.   The guidance is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates a requirement for the retroactive adjustment on a step by step basis of the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings as if the equity method had been effective during all previous periods that the investment had been held when an investment qualifies for equity method accounting due to an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence.  The cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee is to be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the equity method of accounting should be adopted as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-07 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.  The new guidance allows for entities to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur.  In addition, the guidance allows employers to withhold shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements up to the employees  maximum individual tax rate

  without causing the award to be classified as a liability.  The guidance also stipulates that cash paid by an employer to a taxing authority when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues and intends to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company s consolidated statement of cash flows.

   4.                    INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an aggregate investment of approximately $319.8 million in its equity method joint ventures.  The Company formed these ventures with unaffiliated third parties, or acquired interests in them, to develop or manage primarily office and multi-family rental properties, or to acquire land in anticipation of possible development of office and multi-family rental properties.  As of September 30, 2016, the unconsolidated joint ventures owned: 36 office and two retail properties aggregating approximately 5.7 million square feet, 10 multi-family properties totaling 3,587 apartments, a 350-room hotel, development projects for up to approximately 822 apartments; and interests and/or rights to developable land parcels able to accommodate up to 4,151 apartments.  The Company s unconsolidated interests range from 7.5 percent to 85 percent subject to specified priority allocations in certain of the joint ventures.  
     
  The amounts reflected in the following tables (except for the Company s share of equity in earnings) are based on the historical financial information of the individual joint ventures.  The Company does not record losses of the joint ventures in excess of its investment balances unless the Company is liable for the obligations of the joint venture or is otherwise committed to provide financial support to the joint venture.  The outside basis portion of the Company s investments in joint ventures is amortized over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying ventures  tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Unless otherwise noted below, the debt of the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures generally is non-recourse to the Company, except for customary exceptions pertaining to such matters as intentional misuse of funds, environmental conditions, and material misrepresentations.  
     
  The Company has agreed to guarantee repayment of a portion of the debt of its unconsolidated joint ventures.  As of September 30, 2016, such debt had a total facility amount of $272.2 million of which the Company agreed to guarantee up to $22 million.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of such debt totaled $221.8 million of which $22 million was guaranteed by the Company.  The Company performed management, leasing, development and other services for the properties owned by the unconsolidated joint ventures and recognized $0.9 million and $1.4 million for such services in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company had $1.4 million and $0.8 million in accounts receivable due from its unconsolidated joint ventures as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  Included in the Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of September 30, 2016 are four unconsolidated development joint ventures, which are VIEs for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary.  These joint ventures are primarily established to develop real estate property for long-term investment and were deemed VIEs primarily based on the fact that the equity investment at risk was not sufficient to permit the entities to finance their activities without additional financial support.  The initial equity contributed to these entities was not sufficient to fully finance the real estate construction as development costs are funded by the partners throughout the construction period.  The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs based on the fact that the Company has shared control of these entities along with the entity s partners and therefore does not have controlling financial interests in these VIEs.  The Company s aggregate investment in these VIEs was approximately $183.6 million as of September 30, 2016.  The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs is estimated to be approximately $205.6 million, which includes the Company s current investment and estimated future funding commitments/guarantees of approximately $22 million.  The Company has not provided financial support to these VIEs that it was not previously contractually required to provide.  In general, future costs of development not financed through third party will be funded with capital contributions from the Company and its outside partners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages.

  The South Pier at Harborside venture had a $59.1 million mortgage loan collateralized by the hotel property, which bore interest at a rate of 6.15 percent and was scheduled to mature in November 2016.  The venture also had a $3.0 million loan with the City of Jersey City, provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD loan ), which was guaranteed by the Company, half of which was indemnified by the venture partner.  On September 14, 2016, the venture refinanced the mortgage loan and repaid in full the HUD loan, eliminating the previous guarantee which had caused the Company to carry this investment at a negative balance. The Company recorded this reversal through equity in earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The new loan, with a balance of $100.0 million at September 30, 2016, bears interest at a rate of 3.668 percent and matures in October 2026.  In connection with the refinancing, the venture distributed $35.7 million of the loan proceeds, of which the Company s share was $17.8 million.  Due to the fact that the Company s equity basis in this investment was now held at zero, $17.8 million was recognized as equity in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company has no obligations to fund future venture losses nor has any guarantees on the joint venture s current debt.

   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
     
   Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk   
     
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of $350 million that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. During the nine months ending September 30, 2016, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt.  
     
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded ineffectiveness gain of $1,012,000 and zero, respectively, which is included in interest and other investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations, attributable to a floor mismatch in the underlying indices of the derivatives and the hedged interest payments made on its variable-rate debt.  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional $2.7 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.  
     
   Undesignated Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk   
     
  Interest rate caps not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings.  The Company recognized expenses of zero and $12,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $2,000 and $92,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is included in interest and other investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features   
     
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company s default on the indebtedness.  As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $8.0 million.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements.  If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2016, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $8.0 million.

  On January 7, 2016, the Company obtained a new $350 million unsecured term loan, which matures in January 2019 with two one-year extension options.  The interest rate for the new term loan is currently 140 basis points over LIBOR, subject to adjustment on a sliding scale based on the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt ratings, or at the Company s option, a defined leverage ratio.  The Company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to fix LIBOR for the duration of the term loan. Including costs, the current all-in fixed rate is 3.13 percent.  The proceeds from the loan were used primarily to repay outstanding borrowings on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and to repay the Company s $200 million, 5.8 percent senior unsecured notes that matured on January 15, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $2,170,000 and zero of unamortized deferred financing costs related to this debt.

The terms of the unsecured term loan include certain restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and the disposition of real estate properties (to the extent that: (i) such property dispositions cause the Company to default on any of the financial ratios of the term loan described below, or (ii) the property dispositions are completed while the Company is under an event of default under the term loan, unless, under certain circumstances, such disposition is being carried out to cure such default), and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum leverage ratio (60 percent), the maximum amount of secured indebtedness (40 percent), the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage (1.5 times), the maximum amount of unsecured indebtedness (60 percent), the minimum amount of unencumbered property interest coverage (2.0 times) and certain investment limitations (generally 15 percent of total capitalization).  If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Company will not make any excess distributions except to enable the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code.  The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under its unsecured term loan as of September 30, 2016.

It has two six-month extension options each requiring the payment of a 7.5 basis point fee.  The interest rate on outstanding borrowings (not electing the Company s competitive bid feature) and the facility fee on the current borrowing capacity payable quarterly in arrears are based upon the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt ratings, as follows:

  The terms of the unsecured facility include certain restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and the disposition of real estate properties (to the extent that: (i) such property dispositions cause the Company to default on any of the financial ratios of the facility described below, or (ii) the property dispositions are completed while the Company is under an event of default under the facility, unless, under certain circumstances, such disposition is being carried out to cure such default), and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum leverage ratio (60 percent), the maximum amount of secured indebtedness (40 percent), the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage (1.5 times), the maximum amount of unsecured indebtedness (60 percent), the minimum amount of unencumbered property interest coverage (2.0 times) and certain investment limitations (generally 15 percent of total capitalization).  If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Company will not make any excess distributions except to enable the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code.

   11.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT 401(k) PLANS    
     
  Employees of the General Partner, who meet certain minimum age and service requirements, are eligible to participate in the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation 401(k) Savings/Retirement Plan (the  401(k) Plan ).  Eligible employees may elect to defer from one percent up to 60 percent of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis to the 401(k) Plan, subject to certain limitations imposed by federal law.  The amounts contributed by employees are immediately vested and non-forfeitable.  The Company may make discretionary matching or profit sharing contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of eligible participants in any plan year.  Participants are always 100 percent vested in their pre-tax contributions and will begin vesting in any matching or profit sharing contributions made on their behalf after two years of service with the Company at a rate of 20 percent per year, becoming 100 percent vested after a total of six years of service with the Company.  All contributions are allocated as a percentage of compensation of the eligible participants for the Plan year.  The assets of the 401(k) Plan are held in trust and a separate account is established for each participant.  A participant may receive a distribution of his or her vested account balance in the 401(k) Plan in a single sum or in installment payments upon his or her termination of service with the Company.  Total expense recognized by the Company for the 401(k) Plan for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $254,000 and zero, respectively, and $746,000 and zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   12.   DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES    
     
  The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  However, considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the assets and liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  
     
  Cash equivalents, receivables, notes receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair values as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, an unsecured term loan, an unsecured revolving credit facility and mortgages, loans payable and other obligations aggregated approximately $2,483,897,000 and $2,150,507,000 as compared to the book value of approximately $2,455,309,000 and $2,145,393,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was categorized as a level 3 basis (as provided by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures).  The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis valuation based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.  The fair value of the mortgage debt and the unsecured notes was determined by discounting the future contractual interest and principal payments by a market rate.  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivative financial instruments utilize level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the  
     
 37   

Table of Contents   
     
  significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative financial instruments valuations in their entirety are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
     
  The fair value measurements used in the evaluation of the Company s rental properties are considered to be Level 3 valuations within the fair value hierarchy, as there are significant unobservable inputs. Examples of inputs utilized in the fair value calculations include estimated holding periods, discount rates, market capitalization rates, expected lease rental rates, and third party broker information.  For rental properties identified as held for sale, fair value measurements used represent estimated fair value of properties, less selling costs, based on contract prices when available.  
     
  The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements at September 30, 2015 were as follows:

Disclosure about fair value of assets and liabilities is based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2016 and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

  Through February 2016, the Company could not dispose of or distribute certain of its properties which were originally contributed by certain unrelated common unitholders of the Operating Partnership, without the express written consent of such common unitholders, as applicable, except in a manner which did not result in recognition of any built-in-gain (which could result in an income tax liability) or which reimbursed the appropriate specific common unitholders for the tax consequences of the recognition of such built-in-gains (collectively, the  Property Lock-Ups ).  The aforementioned restrictions did not apply in the event that the Company sold all of its properties or in connection with a sale transaction which the Company s Board of Directors determined was reasonably necessary to satisfy a material monetary default on any unsecured debt, judgment or liability of the Company or to cure any material monetary default on any mortgage secured by a property.  The Property Lock-Ups expired as of February 2016.  Upon the expiration of the Property Lock-Ups, the Company is generally required to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any sale, transfer or other disposition of the subject properties from resulting in the recognition of built-in gain to the specific common unitholders, which include members of the Mack Group (which includes William L. Mack, Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors; David S. Mack, director; and Earle I. Mack, a former director); the Robert Martin Group (which includes Robert F.

  To maintain its qualification as a REIT, not more than 50 percent in value of the outstanding shares of the General Partner may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year of the General Partner, other than its initial taxable year (defined to include certain entities), applying certain constructive ownership rules.  To help ensure that the General Partner will not fail this test, the General Partner s Charter provides, among other things, certain restrictions on the transfer of common stock to prevent further concentration of stock ownership.  Moreover, to evidence compliance with these requirements, the General Partner must maintain records that disclose the actual ownership of its outstanding common stock and demands written statements each year from the holders of record of designated percentages of its common stock requesting the disclosure of the beneficial owners of such common stock.  
     
  Partners  Capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to (a) General Partners  capital consisting of common units in the Operating Partnership held by the General Partner, and (b) Limited Partners  capital consisting of common units and LTIP Units held by the limited partners.  See Note 16: Noncontrolling interests in Subsidiaries.  
     
  Any transactions resulting in the issuance of additional common and preferred stock of the General Partner result in a corresponding issuance by the Operating Partnership of an equivalent amount of common and preferred units to the General Partner.  
     
   SHARE/UNIT REPURCHASE PROGRAM   
     
  In September 2012, the Board of Directors renewed and authorized an increase to the General Partner s repurchase program ( Repurchase Program ).  The General Partner has authorization to repurchase up to $150 million of its outstanding common stock under the renewed Repurchase Program, which it may repurchase from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions.  The General Partner has purchased and retired 394,625 shares of its outstanding common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $11 million (all of which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2012), with a remaining authorization under the Repurchase Program of $139 million.  Concurrent with these purchases, the General Partner sold to the Operating Partnership common units for approximately $11 million.  
     
   DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

The DRIP provides for automatic reinvestment of all or a portion of a participant s dividends from the Company s shares of common stock.  The DRIP also permits participants to make optional cash investments up to $5,000 a month without restriction and, if the Company waives this limit, for additional amounts subject to certain restrictions and other conditions set forth in the DRIP prospectus filed as part of the Company s effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC for the approximately 5.5 million shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the DRIP.

   PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS   
     
  On June 5, 2015, in connection with the Executive Employment Agreements, the Company granted a total of 112,651.64 performance share units ( PSUs ) which will vest from 0 to 150 percent of the number of PSUs granted based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to a peer group of equity office REITs over a three-year performance period starting from the grant date, each PSU evidencing the right to receive a share of the Company s common stock upon vesting.  The PSUs are also entitled to the payment of dividend equivalents in respect of vested PSUs in the form of additional PSUs.  The PSUs were valued in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, at their fair value on the grant date, utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the vesting conditions being satisfied.  
     
  The Company has reserved shares of common stock under the 2013 Plan for issuance upon vesting of the PSUs in accordance with their terms and conditions.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $0.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSUs granted under the Company s stock compensation plans.  That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.  
     
   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS   
     
  On March 8, 2016, the Company granted Long-Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) awards to senior management of the Company, including all of the Company s executive officers (the  2016 LTIP Awards ).  All of the 2016 LTIP Awards were in the form of units in the Operating Partnership ( LTIP Units ) and constitute awards under the 2013 Plan. For Messrs. Rudin, DeMarco and Tycher, approximately 25 percent of the target 2016 LTIP Award was in the form of a time-based award that will vest after three years on March 8, 2019 (the  2016 TBV LTIP Units ), and the remaining approximately 75 percent of the target 2016 LTIP Award was in the form of a performance-based award under a new Outperformance Plan (the  2016 OPP ) adopted by the Company s Board of Directors consisting of a multi-year, performance-based equity compensation plan and related forms of award agreement (the  2016 PBV LTIP Units ).  For all other executive officers, approximately 40 percent of the target 2016 LTIP Award was in the form of 2016 TBV LTIP Units and the remaining approximately 60 percent of the target 2016 LTIP Award was in the form of 2016 PBV LTIP Units.  
     
  The 2016 OPP is designed to align the interests of senior management to relative and absolute performance of the Company over a three-year performance period from March 8, 2016 through March 7, 2019. The senior management team that received 2016 LTIP Awards includes the Company s eight executive officers.  Participants in the 2016 OPP will only earn the full awards if, over the three-year performance period, the Company achieves a 50 percent absolute total stockholder return ( TSR ) and if the Company is in the 75th percentile of performance versus the NAREIT Office Index.  
     
  LTIP Units will remain subject to forfeiture depending on the extent that the 2016 LTIP Awards vest. The number of LTIP Units to be issued initially to recipients of the 2016 PBV LTIP Awards is the maximum number of LTIP Units that may be earned under the awards. The number of LTIP Units that actually vest for each award recipient will be determined at the end of the performance measurement period. TSR for the Company and for the Index over the three-year measurement period and other circumstances will determine how many LTIP Units vest for each recipient; if they are fewer than the number issued initially, the balance will be forfeited as of the performance measurement date.  
     
  Prior to vesting, recipients of LTIP Units will be entitled to receive per unit distributions equal to one-tenth (10 percent) of the regular quarterly distributions payable on a common unit of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (a  common unit ), but will not be entitled to receive any special distributions. Distributions with respect to the other nine-tenths (90 percent) of regular quarterly distributions payable on a common unit will accrue but shall only become payable upon vesting of the LTIP Unit. After vesting of the 2016 TBV LTIP Units or the end of the measurement period for the 2016 PBV LTIP Units, the number of LTIP Units,  
     
 43   

Table of Contents   
     
  both vested and unvested, will be entitled to receive distributions in an amount per unit equal to distributions, both regular and special, payable on a common unit.  
     
  The Company granted a total of 499,756 PBV LTIP Units and 157,617 TBV LTIP Units.  The LTIP Units were valued in accordance with ASC 718   Stock Compensation, at their fair value. The Company has reserved shares of common stock under the 2013 Plan for issuance upon vesting and conversion of the LTIP Units in accordance with their terms and conditions.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $7.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested 2016 LTIP Awards granted under the Company s stock compensation plans.  That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years.  
     
   DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS   
     
  The Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, which commenced January 1, 1999, allows non-employee directors of the Company to elect to defer up to 100 percent of their annual retainer fee into deferred stock units.  The deferred stock units are convertible into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the directors  termination of service from the Board of Directors or a change in control of the Company, as defined in the plan.  Deferred stock units are credited to each director quarterly using the closing price of the Company s common stock on the applicable dividend record date for the respective quarter.  Each participating director s account is also credited for an equivalent amount of deferred stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 11,249 and 15,279 deferred stock units were earned, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 190,322 and 178,039 deferred stock units outstanding, respectively.  
     
   EARNINGS PER SHARE/UNIT   
     
  Basic EPS or EPU excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders or unitholders by the weighted average number of shares or units outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS or EPU reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

  The following table reflects the activity of noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively   (dollars in thousands):  

Pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation, on the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary, changes in a parent s ownership interest (and transactions with noncontrolling interest unitholders in the subsidiary) while the parent retains its controlling interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for as equity transactions.  The carrying value of the noncontrolling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in its ownership interest in the subsidiary, with the offset to equity attributable to the parent.  Accordingly, as a result of equity transactions which caused changes in ownership percentages between Mack-Cali Realty Corporation stockholders  equity and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has decreased noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and increased additional paid-in capital in Mack-Cali Realty Corporation stockholders  equity by approximately $0.9 million as of September 30, 2016.  
     
   Common Units   
     
  Certain individuals and entities own common units in the Operating Partnership.  A common unit and a share of Common Stock of the General Partner have substantially the same economic characteristics in as much as they effectively share equally in the net income or loss of the Operating Partnership.  Common unitholders have the right to redeem their common units, subject to certain restrictions.  The redemption is required to be satisfied in shares of Common Stock, cash, or a combination thereof, calculated as follows:  one share of the General Partner s Common Stock, or cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the General Partner s Common Stock at the time of redemption, for each common unit.  The General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines the form of redemption of common units (i.e., whether a common unitholder receives Common Stock, cash, or any combination thereof).  If the General Partner elects to satisfy the redemption with shares of Common Stock as opposed to cash, it is obligated to issue shares of its Common Stock to the redeeming unitholder.  Regardless of the rights described above, the common unitholders may not put their units for cash to the General Partner or the Operating Partnership under any circumstances.  When a unitholder redeems a common unit, noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership is reduced and Mack-Cali Realty Corporation Stockholders  equity is increased.  
     
   LTIP Units   
     
  On March 8, 2016, the Company granted 2016 LTIP awards to senior management of the Company, including all of the General Partner s executive officers.  All of the 2016 LTIP Awards will be in the form of units in the Operating Partnership. See Note 15: Mack-Cali Realty Corporation Stockholders  Equity and Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. s Partners  Capital   Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards.

Table of Contents   
     
  LTIP Units are designed to qualify as  profits interests  in the Operating Partnership for federal income tax purposes.  As a general matter, the profits interests characteristics of the LTIP Units mean that initially they will not be economically equivalent in value to a common unit.  If and when events specified by applicable tax regulations occur, LTIP Units can over time increase in value up to the point where they are equivalent to common units on a one-for-one basis.  After LTIP Units are fully vested, and to the extent the special tax rules applicable to profits interests have allowed them to become equivalent in value to common units, LTIP Units may be converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. Common units in turn have a one-for-one relationship in value with shares of the General Partner s common stock, and are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for cash or, at the election of the Company, shares of the General Partner s common stock.  
     
   Unit Transactions   
     
  The following table sets forth the changes in noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership which relate to the common units and LTIP units in the Operating Partnership for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Noncontrolling Interest Ownership in Operating Partnership   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the noncontrolling interest common unitholders owned 10.5 percent and 10.5 percent of the Operating Partnership, respectively.  
     
   NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES (applicable to General Partner and Operating Partnership)   
     
  The Company consolidates certain joint ventures in which it has ownership interests.  Various entities and/or individuals hold noncontrolling interests in these ventures.  
     
   PARTICIPATION RIGHTS   
     
  The Company s interests in certain real estate projects (three properties and a future development) each provide for the initial distributions of net cash flow solely to the Company, and thereafter, other parties have participation rights in 50 percent of the excess net cash flow remaining after the distribution to the Company of the aggregate amount equal to the sum of: (a) the Company s capital contributions, plus (b) an IRR of 10 percent per annum.  
     
   17.    SEGMENT REPORTING    
     
  The Company operates in three business segments: (i) commercial and other real estate, (ii) multi-family real estate, and (iii) multi-family services.  The Company provides leasing, property management, acquisition, development, construction and tenant-related services for its commercial and other real estate and multi-family real estate portfolio.  The Company s multi-family services business also provides similar services for third parties.  The Company no longer considers construction services as a reportable segment as it phased out this line of business in 2014.  The Company had no revenues from foreign countries recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The Company had no long lived assets in foreign locations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies, excluding depreciation and amortization.  
     
  The Company evaluates performance based upon net operating income from the combined properties in each of its real estate segments (commercial and other, and multi-family) and from its multi-family services segment.

   ITEM 2.                             MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
     
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation and Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. and the notes thereto (collectively, the  Financial Statements ).  Certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Financial Statements.  
     
    Executive Overview    
     
  Mack-Cali Realty Corporation together with its subsidiaries, (collectively, the  General Partner ), is one of the largest real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the United States.  Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. ( the  Operating Partnership ) has been involved in all aspects of commercial real estate development, management and ownership for over 60 years and the General Partner has been a publicly traded REIT since 1994.  
     
  The Operating Partnership conducts the business of providing leasing, management, acquisition, development, construction and tenant-related services for its General Partner.  The Operating Partnership, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, including the Mack-Cali property-owning partnerships and limited liability companies, is the entity through which all of the General Partner s operations are conducted.  Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the  Company  refers to the General Partner and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company owns or has interests in 263 properties (collectively, the  Properties ), consisting of 136 office and 110 flex properties, totaling approximately 29.0 million square feet, leased to approximately 1,800 commercial tenants and 17 multi-family rental properties containing 5,214 residential units.  The Properties are located primarily in the Northeast, some with adjacent, Company-controlled developable land sites able to accommodate up to 5.3 million square feet of additional commercial space and 11,200 apartment units.  
     
  The Company s historical strategy has been to focus its operations, acquisition and development of office properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets and sub-markets where it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator.  In September 2015, the Company announced a three-year strategic initiative to transform into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties and a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties.  As part of this plan, over the past year, the Company has sold or has contracted to sell several properties, primarily commercial office, which it believes do not meet its long-term goals.  
     
  As an owner of real estate, almost all of the Company s earnings and cash flow are derived from rental revenue received pursuant to leased space at the Properties.  Key factors that affect the Company s business and financial results include the following:  
     
                        the general economic climate; 
                        the occupancy rates of the Properties; 
                        rental rates on new or renewed leases; 
                        tenant improvement and leasing costs incurred to obtain and retain tenants; 
                        the extent of early lease terminations; 
                        the value of our office properties and the cash flow from the sale of such properties; 
                        operating expenses; 
                        anticipated acquisition and development costs for  office and multi-family rental properties and the revenues and earnings from these properties; 
                        cost of capital; and 
                        the extent of acquisitions, development and sales of real estate, including the execution of the Company s current strategic initiative. 
     
  Any negative effects of the above key factors could potentially cause a deterioration in the Company s revenue and/or earnings.  Such negative effects could include: (1) failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire; (2) failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in-place leases; and (3) tenant defaults.

Table of Contents   
     
  A failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in-place leases may be affected by several factors such as: (1) the local economic climate, which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors; and (2) local real estate conditions, such as oversupply of the Company s product types or competition within the market.  
     
  Of the Company s core office markets, most have recently shown signs of improvement while others have stabilized.  The percentage leased in the Company s consolidated portfolio of stabilized operating commercial properties aggregating 23.4 million, 23.5 million and 24.0 million square feet at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, was 87.7 percent leased at September 30, 2016 as compared to 86.7 percent leased at June 30, 2016 and 85.8 percent leased at September 30, 2015.  Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases that expire at the period end date.  Leases that expired at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 aggregate 29,692, 104,901 and 64,226 square feet, respectively, or 0.1, 0.5 and 0.3 percentage of the net rentable square footage, respectively.  Rental rates (including escalations) on the Company s commercial space that was renewed (based on first rents payable) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 (on 318,308 square feet of renewals) increased an average of 0.8 percent compared to rates that were in effect under the prior leases, as compared to a 3.7 percent increase during the three months ended September 30, 2015 (on 481,316 square feet of renewals).  Estimated lease costs for the renewed leases during the three months ended September 30, 2016 averaged $2.46 per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of 3.1 years, and estimated lease costs for the renewed leases during the three months ended September 30, 2015 averaged $3.19 per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of 3.4 years.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, rental rates (including escalations) on the Company s commercial space that was renewed (based on first rents payable on 1,415,554 square feet of renewals) increased an average of 11.6 percent compared to rates that were in effect under the prior leases, as compared to a 0.3 percent increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (on 1,871,829 square feet of renewals).  Estimated lease costs for the renewed leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 averaged $4.19 per square foot per year for a weighted averaged lease term of 5.2 years and estimated lease costs for the renewed leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 averaged $2.46 per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of 3.0 years.  The Company has achieved positive leasing results in its core markets recently.  It believes that commercial vacancy rates may decrease and commercial rental rates may increase in some of its markets in 2016 and possibly beyond.  As of September 30, 2016, commercial leases which comprise approximately 1.7 and 15.2 percent of the Company s annualized base rent are scheduled to expire during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  With the positive leasing results the Company has achieved in many of its markets recently, the Company believes that rental rates it is likely to achieve on new leases will generally be, on average, not lower than rates currently being paid.  Although the Company has recently achieved positive leasing activity, primarily in its core markets, if the recent leasing results do not prove to be sustaining during 2016 and beyond, the Company s rental rates it may achieve on new leases may be lower than the rates currently being paid, resulting in the potential for less revenue from the same space.  
     
  The Company believes that there is a potential for Moody s or Standard   Poor s to lower their current investment grade ratings on the Company s senior unsecured debt to sub-investment grade.  Amongst other things, any such downgrade by both Moody s and Standard   Poor s will increase the current interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Company s $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility from LIBOR plus 130 basis points to LIBOR plus 170 basis points and the annual credit facility fee it pays will increase from 30 to 35 basis points.  Additionally, any such downgrade would increase the current interest rate on the Company s $350 million unsecured term loan from LIBOR plus 140 basis points to LIBOR plus 185 points.  In this case, the Company could elect to utilize the leverage grid pricing available under the unsecured term loan, which would result in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 155 basis points at the Company s current total leverage ratio.  In addition, a downgrade in its ratings to sub-investment grade would result in higher interest rates on senior unsecured debt that the Company may issue in the future as compared to issuing such debt with investment grade ratings.

    Recent Transactions    
     
   Acquisitions   
     
  The Company acquired the following office properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016  (dollars in thousands) :  

(a)       Acquisition represented four units of condominium interests which collectively comprise floors 2 through 5. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Company owns the entire 14-story 262,000 square-foot building. The acquisition was funded using available cash. 
  (b)       This acquisition was funded through borrowings under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  (c)        This acquisition was funded using available cash and through borrowings under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility. 
     
   Consolidations   
     
  On January 5, 2016, the Company, which held a 50 percent subordinated interest in the unconsolidated joint venture, Overlook Ridge Apartment Investors LLC, a 371-unit multi-family operating property located in Malden, Massachusetts, acquired the remaining interest for $39.8 million in cash plus the assumption of a first mortgage loan secured by the property with a principal balance of $52.7 million.  The cash portion of the acquisition was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility.  Upon acquisition, the Company consolidated the asset and accordingly, remeasured its equity interests, as required by the FASB s consolidation guidance, at fair value (based upon the income approach using current rates and market cap rates and discount rates).  As a result, the Company recorded a gain on change of control of interests of $10.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  On January 19, 2016, the Company repaid the assumed loan and obtained a new loan secured by the property in the amount of $72.5 million, which bears interest at 3.625 percent and matures in February 2023.  See Note 10: Mortgages, Loans Payable and Other Obligations.  
     
  During the second quarter 2016, the Company, which held a 38.25 percent subordinate interest in the unconsolidated Portside Apartment Developers, L.L.C., a joint venture which owns a 175-unit operating multi-family property located in East Boston, Massachusetts, acquired the remaining interests of its joint venture partners for $39.6 million in cash plus the assumption of a mortgage loan secured by the property with a principal balance of $42.5 million.  The cash portion of the acquisition was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility.  Upon acquisition, the Company consolidated the asset and accordingly, remeasured its equity interests, as required by the FASB s consolidation guidance, at fair value (based upon the income approach using current rates and market cap rates and discount rates).  As a result, the Company recorded a gain on change of control of interests of $5.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  On July 8, 2016, the Company repaid the assumed loan and obtained a new loan secured by the property in the amount of $59 million, which bears interest at 3.44 percent and matures in August 2023.  See Note 10: Mortgages, Loans Payable and Other Obligations.  
     
   Other Investments   
     
  On April 26, 2016, the Company acquired the remaining non-controlling interest in a development project located in Weehawken, NJ for $36.4 million.  The project includes developable land for approximately 1,100 multi-family units, 290,000 square feet of office space, a 52.5 percent ownership interest in Port Imperial 4/5 Garage and Retail operating properties.  The initial phase, Port Imperial South 11, a 295-unit multi-family project, began construction in the second quarter 2016.

The properties are located in Freehold, New Jersey, Roseland, New Jersey, Greenbelt, Maryland and Lanham, Maryland.  The total estimated sales proceeds from the three separate sales are expected to be approximately $113 million.

The Company realized a gain on the sale of $5.7 million.  
     
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, which consist principally of the Operating Partnership and variable interest entities for which the Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary, if any.  See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies   Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures   to the Financial Statements, for the Company s treatment of unconsolidated joint venture interests.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
     
   Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810, Consolidation, provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities  or  VIEs ) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIEs. Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack  (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the  
     
 53   

Table of Contents   
     
  equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest.  The Company consolidates VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance: and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the VIE that would be significant to the VIE.  
     
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted accounting guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, modifying the analysis it must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities or voting interest model entities.  The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model.  Under the revised guidance, the Operating Partnership will be a variable interest entity of the parent company, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.  As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the balance sheets of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, the identification of this entity as a variable interest entity has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.  There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption.  
     
  The Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in order to conform with current period presentation.  These estimates and assumptions are based on management s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.  The Company s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain.  Different estimates could have a material effect on the Company s financial results.  Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances.  
     
    Rental Property  :  
     
  Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Costs directly related to the acquisition, development and construction of rental properties are capitalized.  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.  Capitalized development and construction costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development and construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development.  Interest capitalized by the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $14.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred; major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.  Fully-depreciated assets are removed from the accounts.  
     
  The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity (as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup).  If portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants, or held available for occupancy, and other portions have not yet reached that stage, the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project.  The Company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy, primarily based on a percentage of the relative square footage of each portion, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction.  
     
  Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Leasehold interests        

Remaining lease term            

Buildings and improvements       

5 to 40 years           

Tenant improvements       

The shorter of the term   of the related lease or useful life           

Furniture, fixtures and equipment       

5 to 10 years              
     
  Upon acquisition of rental property, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships.  The Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Company records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed differ from the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and  
     
 54   

Table of Contents   
     
  intangible assets acquired, the Company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information.  The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.  
     
  Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases.  
     
  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall relationship with the respective tenant.  Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases.  In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions.  In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.  Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Company s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals.  The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases.  The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships.  
     
  On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company s rental properties held for use may be impaired.  In addition to identifying any specific circumstances which may affect a property or properties, management considers other criteria for determining which properties may require assessment for potential impairment.  The criteria considered by management include reviewing low leased percentages, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, near-term mortgage debt maturities or other factors that might impact the Company s intent and ability to hold the property.  A property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the fair value of the property.  The Company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions.  These assumptions are generally based on management s experience in its local real estate markets and the effects of current market conditions.  The assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property.  As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved, and actual losses or impairments may be realized in the future.  
     
    Rental Property Held for Sale  :  
     
  When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets.  The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority and there are no significant contingencies relating to the sale.  If, in management s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established.  
     
  If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as held and used.  A property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.  
     
    Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  :  
     
  The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting.  The Company applies the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions.  The outside basis portion of the Company s joint ventures is amortized over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying ventures  tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Generally, the Company would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances)  
     
 55

  is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Company has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Company only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses.  
     
  On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.  An investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.  To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the value of the investment.  The Company s estimates of value for each investment (particularly in real estate joint ventures) are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs.  As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future.  See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures   to the Financial Statements.  
     
    Revenue Recognition  :  
     
  Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases.  Unbilled rents receivable represents the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements.  
     
  Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases.  The capitalized above-market lease values for acquired properties are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases.  
     
  Escalations and recoveries from tenants are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements.  These costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and other recoverable costs.  
     
  Real estate services revenue includes property management, development, construction and leasing commission fees and other services, and payroll and related costs reimbursed from clients.  Fee income derived from the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures (which are capitalized by such ventures) are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated ownership interests.  
     
  Parking income includes income from parking spaces leased to tenants and others.  
     
  Other income includes income from tenants for additional services arranged for by the Company and income from tenants for early lease terminations.  
     
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  :  
     
  Management performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if an allowance for doubtful accounts is required based on factors affecting the collectability of the accounts receivable balances. The factors considered by management in determining which individual tenant receivable balances, or aggregate receivable balances, require a collectability allowance include the age of the receivable, the tenant s payment history, the nature of the charges, any communications regarding the charges and other related information. Management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of collection losses, which affects the allowance and net income.

  The following is a summary of the changes in revenue from rental operations and property expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 divided into Same-Store Properties, Acquired Properties and Properties Sold in 2015 and 2016  (dollars in thousands):   

Base rents.   Base rents for the Same-Store Properties increased $6.2 million, or 5.2 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to a 1.4 percent increase in the average same store percent leased to 87.2 percent from 85.8 percent, and an $0.84 increase in average annual rents per square foot to $22.40 from $21.56 for 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Escalations and recoveries  . Escalations and recoveries from tenants for the Same-Store Properties increased $1.1 million, or 7.5 percent, for 2016 over 2015 due primarily to higher utility and operating expenses to recover in 2016, as well as lower recoveries from tenants in 2015 on account of real estate tax appeal proceeds. 
     
   Parking income.   Parking income for the Same-Store Properties was relatively unchanged for 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Other income.   Other income for the Same-Store Properties increased $0.6 million, or 51.6 percent, for 2016 over 2015, due primarily to proceeds from a litigation settlement received in 2016. 
     
   Real estate taxes  . Real estate taxes on the Same-Store Properties increased $2.5 million, or 13.0 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015.  The change in real estate taxes principally results from a decrease in tax appeal proceeds received in 2016 as compared to 2015.  Real estate taxes, without the effect of net tax appeal proceeds, increased $0.7 million, or 3.9 percent, for 2016 over 2015, due primarily to increased rates. 
     
   Utilities.   Utilities for the Same-Store Properties increased $0.6 million, or 4.3 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increased usage in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Operating Services.   Operating services for the Same-Store Properties increased $0.9 million, or 3.8 percent, due primarily to an increase in maintenance costs in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Real estate services revenue.   Real estate services revenue (primarily reimbursement of property personnel costs) decreased $0.9 million, or 11.5 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to decreased third party development and management activity in multi-family services in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Real estate services expense.   Real estate services expense decreased $0.3 million, or 4.7 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to decreased compensation and related costs. 
     
   General and administrative.   General and administrative expenses increased $0.3 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increases in various small overhead items.

   Acquisition-related costs.   The Company incurred transaction costs of $0.8 million in 2016 related to the Company s property and consolidated joint venture acquisitions.  See Note 3 to the Financial Statements: Recent Transactions   Acquisitions. 
     
   Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased $4.0 million, or 9.1 percent, for 2016 over 2015.  This increase was due primarily to depreciation of $9.9 million in 2016 on the Acquired Properties, partially offset by lower depreciation of $4.8 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 for properties sold or removed from service and a decrease of $1.1 million for 2016 as compared to 2015 on the Same-Store Properties due to assets becoming fully amortized. 
     
   Interest expense  . Interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 1.8 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015.  This decrease was primarily the result of lower average interest rates achieved on refinanced debt in late 2015 and early 2016. 
     
   Impairments.   The Company recorded $164.2 million in impairment charges in 2015 on certain properties to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair market values. 
     
   Interest and other investment income.   Interest and other investment income increased $1.3 million, 2016 over 2015, primarily as a result of a valuation mark-to-market gain for an interest swap in 2016. 
     
   Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures.   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $18.7 million, or 595.1 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015.  The increase was due primarily to an increase in equity in earnings income of $21.7 million from refinancing proceeds received from the Company s South Pier at Harborside venture, partially offset by several small decreases in equity in earnings for certain joint ventures in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Realized gains (losses) and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property, net.   The Company had realized losses on disposition of rental property of $7.3 million in 2016, net of unrealized valuation losses recognized on property held for sale of $24.4 million, and $18.7 million in net gains from sales in 2015. 
     
   Loss from extinguishment of debt, net.   In 2016, the Company recognized a loss from extinguishment of debt of $19.3 million due to the costs of the early repayment of certain Senior Unsecured Notes. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements: Senior Unsecured Notes. 
     
   Net income.   Net loss decreased to $9.6 million in 2016 from a loss of $142.1 million in 2015.  The decreased loss of $132.5 million was due to the factors discussed above.

Base rents.   Base rents for the Same-Store Properties increased $16.4 million, or 4.5 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to a 2.5 percent increase in the average same store percent leased to 87.2 percent from 84.7 percent, and a $0.52 increase in average annual rents per square foot to $22.15 from $21.63 for 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Escalations and recoveries  . Escalations and recoveries from tenants for the Same-Store Properties decreased $2.4 million, or 4.8 percent, for 2016 over 2015 due primarily to lower utility and operating expenses to recover in 2016, as well as lower recoveries from tenants in 2015 on account of real estate tax appeal proceeds. 
     
   Parking income.   Parking income for the Same-Store Properties increased $0.7 million, or 8.5 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to increased usage.

   Real estate taxes  . Real estate taxes on the Same-Store Properties increased $5.5 million, or 8.7 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015.  The change in real estate taxes principally results from a decrease in tax appeal proceeds received in 2016 as compared to 2015.  Real estate taxes, without the effect of net tax appeal proceeds, were relatively unchanged for 2016 as compared to 2015. 
     
   Utilities.   Utilities for the Same-Store Properties decreased $5.3 million, or 12.0 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to decreased electricity rates and usage in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily on account of a mild winter in 2016. 
     
   Operating Services.   Operating services for the Same-Store Properties decreased $1.3 million, or 1.7 percent, due primarily to a decrease in snow removal costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 on account of a mild winter in 2016. 
     
   Real estate services revenue.   Real estate services revenue (primarily reimbursement of property personnel costs) decreased $2.6 million, or 11.6 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to decreased third party development and management activity in multi-family services in 2016 as compared to 2015.

   Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased $7.4 million, or 5.8 percent, for 2016 over 2015.  This increase was due primarily to depreciation of $17.7 million in 2016 on the Acquired Properties, partially offset by lower depreciation of $8.5 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 for properties sold or being removed from service and a decrease of $1.8 million for 2016 as compared to 2015 on the Same-Store Properties due to assets becoming fully amortized. 
     
   Impairments.   The Company recorded $164.2 million in impairment charges in 2015 on certain properties to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair market values. 
     
   Interest expense  . Interest expense decreased $6.5 million, or 8.3 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015.  This decrease was primarily the result of lower average interest rates achieved on refinanced debt in late 2015 and 2016. 
     
   Interest and other investment income.   Interest and other investment income increased $0.2 million, or 31.3 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of a valuation mark-to-market gain for an interest rate swap in 2016. 
     
   Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures.   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $22.3 million, or 820.6 percent, for 2016 as compared to 2015.  The increase was due primarily to an increase in equity in earnings income of $21.7 million from refinancing proceeds received from the Company s South Pier at Harborside venture. 
     
   Gain on change of control of interests.   In 2016, the Company recorded a gain on change of control of $15.3 million in connection with the acquisitions of the remaining interests of residential properties located in Malden and East Boston, Massachusetts. 
     
   Realized gains (losses) and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property, net.   The Company had realized gains on disposition of rental property of $96.7 million net of unrealized losses recognized on property held for sale of $28.0 million in 2016 and $53.3 million in gains from sales in 2015.  See Note 3: Recent Transactions   to the Financial Statements. 
     
   Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture.   In 2016, the Company realized a gain of $5.7 million on the sale of an unconsolidated joint venture property located in Weehawken, New Jersey.  In 2015, the Company realized a gain of $6.4 million on the sale of an unconsolidated joint venture property located in Morristown, New Jersey. 
     
   Loss from extinguishment of debt, net.   In 2016, the Company recognized a loss from extinguishment of debt, net of $6.9 million, due primarily to a loss of $19.3 million due to the costs of the early repayment of certain Senior Unsecured Notes.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements: Senior Unsecured Notes.  This was partially offset by a $12.4 million gain on early extinguishment of debt from the repayment of certain mortgage loans in 2016.  See Note 10: Mortgage, Loans Payable and Other Obligations. 
     
   Net income.   Net income increased to $113.5 million in 2016 from a loss of $106.1 million in 2015.  The increase of $219.6 million was due to the factors discussed above. 
     
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
    Liquidity    
     
    Overview  :  
     
  Historically, rental revenue has been the Company s principal source of funds to pay operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and dividends, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures.  To the extent that the Company s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance its non-recurring capital expenditures such as property acquisitions, development and construction costs and other capital expenditures, the Company has and expects to continue to finance such activities through borrowings under its revolving credit facility, other debt and equity financings, proceeds from the sale of properties and joint venture capital.  
     
  The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital, which may include proceeds from the sales of office properties, net cash provided by operating activities and from its revolving credit facility.  The Company frequently examines potential property acquisitions and development projects and, at any given time, one or more of such acquisitions or development projects may be under consideration.  Accordingly, the ability to fund property acquisitions and development projects is a major part of the Company s financing requirements.  The Company expects to meet its financing requirements through funds generated from operating activities, to the extent available, proceeds from property sales, joint venture capital, long-term and short-term borrowings (including draws on the Company s revolving credit facility) and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.

    Construction Projects  :  
     
  On May 21, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Ironstate Harborside-A LLC ( ISA ) to form Harborside Unit A Urban Renewal, L.L.C. ( URL-Harborside ), a newly-formed joint venture that will develop, own and operate a high-rise tower of approximately 763 multi-family apartment units above a parking pedestal to be located on land contributed by the Company at its Harborside complex in Jersey City, New Jersey (the  URL Project ).  The Company owns an 85 percent interest in URL-Harborside and the remaining interest is owned by ISA, with shared control over major decisions such as approval of budgets, property financings and leasing guidelines.  The construction of the URL Project is estimated to cost a total of approximately $320 million (of which development costs of $286.7 million have been incurred by URL-Harborside through September 30, 2016).  The URL Project is projected to be ready for occupancy by the first quarter of 2017.  The venture has a construction/permanent loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $192 million (with $142.7 million outstanding as of September 30, 2016).  The Company does not expect to fund any future development costs of the project, as future development costs will be funded by using the loan financing.  
     
  The Company owns a 76.25 percent interest in a consolidated joint venture which is constructing a 108-unit multi-family development rental property located in Eastchester, New York (the  Eastchester Project ).

    REIT Restrictions  :  
     
  To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, the General Partner must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains.  Moreover, the General Partner intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders.  Based upon the most recently paid common stock dividend rate of $0.15 per common share, in the aggregate, such distributions would equal approximately $53.8 million ($60.5 million, including units in the Operating Partnership, held by parties other than the General Partner) on an annualized basis.  However, any such distributions, whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise, would be paid out of available cash, including borrowings and other sources, after meeting operating requirements, preferred stock dividends and distributions, and scheduled debt service on the Company s debt.  If and to the extent the Company retains and does not distribute any net capital gains, the General Partner will be required to pay federal, state and local taxes on such net capital gains at the rate applicable to capital gains of a corporation.  
     
    Property Lock-Ups  :  
     
  Through February 2016, the Company could not dispose of or distribute certain of its properties which were originally contributed by certain unrelated common unitholders of the Operating Partnership, without the express written consent of such common unitholders, as applicable, except in a manner which did not result in recognition of any built-in-gain (which could result in an income tax liability) or which reimbursed the appropriate specific common unitholders for the tax consequences of the recognition of such built-in-gains (collectively, the  Property Lock-Ups ).  The aforementioned restrictions did not apply in the event that the Company sold all of its properties or in connection with a sale transaction which the Company s Board of Directors determined was reasonably necessary to satisfy a material monetary default on any unsecured debt, judgment or liability of the Company or to cure any material monetary default on any mortgage secured by a property.  The Property Lock-Ups expired as of February 2016.  Upon the expiration of the Property Lock-Ups, the Company is generally required to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any sale, transfer or other disposition of the subject properties from resulting in the recognition of built-in gain to the specific common unitholders, which include members of the Mack Group (which includes William L. Mack, Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors; David S. Mack, director; and Earle I. Mack, a former director), the Robert Martin Group (which includes Robert F. Weinberg, a former director and current member of its Advisory Board), and the Cali Group (which includes John R. Cali, a former director and current member of its Advisory Board).  As of September 30, 2016, 116 of the Company s properties, with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion, have lapsed restrictions and are subject to these conditions.  
     
    Unencumbered Properties  :

    Senior Unsecured Notes  :  
     
  On September 12, 2016, the Company commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its $250 million principal amount, 7.750 percent Senior Unsecured Notes due August 15, 2019, subject to certain terms and conditions. On September 19, 2016, the Company purchased $114.9 million principal amount of these notes validly tendered pursuant to its tender offer.  The purchase price, including a make-whole premium, was 115.977 percent of the face amount of these notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest up to the settlement date.  The Company funded the purchase price, including accrued and unpaid interest, of approximately $134.1 million using available cash and borrowings on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility.  In connection with the purchase of these notes, the Company recorded approximately $19.3 million as a loss from extinguishment of debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The terms of the Company s senior unsecured notes (which totaled approximately $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2016) include certain restrictions and covenants which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum amount of debt leverage, the maximum amount of secured indebtedness, the minimum amount of debt service coverage and the maximum amount of unsecured debt as a percent of unsecured assets.  
     
    Unsecured Term Loan   : 
     
  On January 7, 2016, the Company obtained a new $350 million unsecured term loan, which matures in January 2019 with two one-year extension options.  The interest rate for the new term loan is currently 140 basis points over LIBOR, subject to adjustment on a sliding scale based on the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt ratings, or at the Company s option, a defined leverage ratio.  The Company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to fix LIBOR for the duration of the term loan. Including costs, the current all-in fixed rate is 3.13 percent.  The proceeds from the loan were used primarily to repay outstanding borrowings on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and to repay the Company s $200 million, 5.8 percent senior unsecured notes that matured on January 15, 2016.  
     
  The interest rate on the unsecured term loan is based upon the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt ratings, as follows:  

66   

Table of Contents   
     
  If the Company elected to use the defined leverage ratio, the interest rate under the unsecured term loan would be based on the following total leverage ratio grid:  

The terms of the unsecured term loan include certain restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and the disposition of real estate properties (to the extent that: (i) such property dispositions cause the Company to default on any of the financial ratios of the term loan described below, or (ii) the property dispositions are completed while the Company is under an event of default under the term loan, unless, under certain circumstances, such disposition is being carried out to cure such default), and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum leverage ratio (60 percent), the maximum amount of secured indebtedness (40 percent), the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage (1.5 times), the maximum amount of unsecured indebtedness (60 percent), the minimum amount of unencumbered property interest coverage (2.0 times) and certain investment limitations (generally 15 percent of total capitalization).  If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Company will not make any excess distributions except to enable the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code.  The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under its unsecured term loan as of September 30, 2016.  
     
    Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility  :  
     
  The Company has a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 17 lenders.  The facility is expandable to $1 billion and matures in July 2017.  It has two six month extension options each requiring the payment of a 7.5 basis point fee.  The interest rate on outstanding borrowings (not electing the Company s competitive bid feature) and the facility fee on the current borrowing capacity payable quarterly in arrears are based upon the Operating Partnership s unsecured debt ratings, as follows:  

The facility has a competitive bid feature, which allows the Company to solicit bids from lenders under the facility to borrow up to $300 million at interest rates less than those above.  
     
  The terms of the unsecured facility include certain restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and the disposition of real estate properties (to the extent that: (i) such property dispositions cause the Company to default on any of the financial ratios of the facility described below, or (ii) the property dispositions are completed while the Company is under an event of default under the facility, unless, under certain circumstances, such disposition is being carried out to cure such default), and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum leverage ratio (60 percent), the maximum amount of secured indebtedness (40 percent), the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage (1.5 times), the maximum amount of unsecured indebtedness (60 percent), the minimum amount of unencumbered property interest coverage (2.0 times) and certain investment limitations (generally 15 percent of total capitalization).  If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Company will not make any excess distributions except to enable the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code.  
     
    Mortgages, Loans Payable and Other Obligations  :  
     
  On September 30, 2016, the Company obtained a $250 million mortgage loan, collateralized by its office property located at 101 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey. The loan bears an interest rate of 3.117 percent and matures in October 2026. The loan is interest-only during its term.  
     
 67   

Table of Contents   
     
  The Company has other mortgages, loans payable and other obligations which consist of various loans collateralized by certain of the Company s rental properties.  Payments on mortgages, loans payable and other obligations are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest, or interest only.  
     
    Debt Strategy  :  
     
  The Company does not intend to reserve funds to retire the Company s senior unsecured notes, outstanding borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility, its unsecured term loan, or its mortgages, loans payable and other obligations upon maturity.  Instead, the Company will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities on or before the applicable maturity dates.  If it cannot raise sufficient proceeds to retire the maturing debt, the Company may draw on its revolving credit facility to retire the maturing indebtedness, which would reduce the future availability of funds under such facility.  As of October 21, 2016, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $125 million under its unsecured revolving credit facility.  The Company is reviewing various financing and refinancing options, including the purchase of the Operating Partnership s senior unsecured notes in privately-negotiated transactions, the issuance of additional, or exchange of current, unsecured debt, of the Operating Partnership or common and preferred stock of the General Partner, and/or obtaining additional mortgage debt, some or all of which may be completed in 2016.  The Company currently anticipates that its available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of office properties, together with cash available from borrowings and other sources, will be adequate to meet the Company s capital and liquidity needs in the short term.  However, if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable, due to current economic conditions or otherwise, or if capital needs to fund acquisition and development opportunities in the multi-family rental sector arise, the Company s ability to make the expected distributions discussed in  REIT Restrictions  above may be adversely affected.  
     
    Equity Financing and Registration Statements    
     
    Common Equity  :  
     
  The following table presents the changes in the General Partner s issued and outstanding shares of common stock and the Operating Partnership s common units for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Share/Unit Repurchase Program  :

There were no common stock repurchases in 2015 and through October 21, 2016.  
     
    Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan  :  
     
  The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the  DRIP ) which commenced in March 1999 under which approximately 5.5 million shares of the Company s common stock have been reserved for future issuance.  The DRIP provides for automatic reinvestment of all or a portion of a participant s dividends from the Company s shares of common stock.  The DRIP also permits participants to make optional cash investments up to $5,000 a month without restriction and, if the Company waives this limit, for additional amounts subject to certain restrictions and other conditions set forth in the DRIP prospectus filed as part of the Company s effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for the approximately 5.5 million shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the DRIP.

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
     
    Unconsolidated Joint Venture Debt  :  
     
  The debt of the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures generally provide for recourse to the Company for customary matters such as intentional misuse of funds, environmental conditions and material misrepresentations. The Company has agreed to guarantee repayment of a portion of the debt of its unconsolidated joint ventures.  Such debt has a total facility amount of $272.2 million of which the Company has agreed to guarantee up to $22 million.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of such debt totaled $221.8 million of which $22 million was guaranteed by the Company.  
     
  The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements are further discussed in Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements.  
     
    Contractual Obligations    
     
  The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to the Company s debt (principal and interest), PILOT agreements, ground lease agreements and other obligations, as of September 30, 2016:  

(a)            Interest payments assume LIBOR rate of 0.55 percent, which is the weighted average rate on this outstanding variable rate debt at September 30, 2016, plus the applicable spread. 
  (b)            Interest payments assume LIBOR rate of 0.54 percent, which is the weighted average rate on its outstanding variable rate mortgage debt at September 30, 2016, plus the applicable spread. 
     
    Funds from Operations    
     
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) is defined as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests of unitholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from depreciable rental property transactions, and impairments related to depreciable rental property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization.  The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT.  The Company further believes that as FFO excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from sales of properties and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs.  
     
  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders as an indication of the Company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition.  However, the Company s FFO is comparable to the FFO of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ).  
     
  As the Company considers its primary earnings measure, net income available to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO, the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common

  shareholders to FFO, as calculated in accordance with NAREIT s current definition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ( in thousands ):  

(a)            Includes the Company s share from unconsolidated joint ventures of $4,559 and $4,845 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $13,948 and $15,828 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Excludes non-real estate-related depreciation and amortization of $305 and $236 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $717 and $722 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $80 and $151 of depreciation expense allocable to the Company s noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $335 and $453 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
     
    Inflation    
     
  The Company s leases with the majority of its commercial tenants provide for recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant s proportionate share of, and/or increases in, real estate taxes and certain operating costs, which reduce the Company s exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation.  The Company believes that inflation did not materially impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that such expectations will be achieved.  Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  
     
  Among the factors about which we have made assumptions are:  
     
                        risks and uncertainties affecting the general economic climate and conditions, which in turn may have a negative effect on the fundamentals of our business and the financial condition of our tenants and residents; 
                        the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; 
                        the extent of any tenant bankruptcies or of any early lease terminations; 
                        our ability to lease or re-lease space at current or anticipated rents; 
                        changes in the supply of and demand for our properties; 
                        changes in interest rate levels and volatility in the securities markets; 
                        our ability to complete construction and development activities on time and within budget, including without limitation obtaining regulatory permits and the availability and cost of materials, labor and equipment; 
                        forward-looking financial and operational information, including information relating to future development projects, potential acquisitions or dispositions, and projected revenue and income;

                        changes in operating costs; 
                        our ability to obtain adequate insurance, including coverage for terrorist acts; 
                        our credit worthiness and the availability of financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt and our future interest expense; 
                        changes in governmental regulation, tax rates and similar matters; and 
                        other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties, including risks that the development may not be completed on schedule, that the tenants or residents will not take occupancy or pay rent, or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated. 
     
  For further information on factors which could impact us and the statements contained herein, see Item 1A: Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015  We assume no obligation to update and supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events, new information or otherwise.  
     
   Item 3.                                      Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
     
  Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.  In pursuing its business plan, the primary market risk to which the Company is exposed is interest rate risk.  Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the Company s yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, its ability to make distributions or payments to its investors.  
     
  Approximately $2.2 billion of the Company s long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 bears interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates.  The following table presents principal cash flows (in thousands) based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate debt.  The interest rates on the Company s variable rate debt as of September 30, 2016 ranged from LIBOR plus 130 basis points to LIBOR plus 950 basis points.  Assuming interest-rate swaps and caps are not in effect, if market rates of interest on the Company s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Company s variable rate debt would be approximately $2.6 million annually and the increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2016 would be approximately $37 million.  

(a)  Adjustment for unamortized debt discount/premium, net, as of September 30, 2016.  
  (b)  Adjustment for unamortized deferred financings costs, net, as of September 30, 2016.  
  (c)  Includes $95 million of outstanding borrowings under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in 2017 with two six-month extension options with the payment of a fee.  
     
  While the Company has not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, defaults could increase and result in losses to the Company which could adversely affect its operating results and liquidity .
