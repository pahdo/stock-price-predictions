(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

General   

On June 29, 2016, Best Hometown Bank (the  Bank )
(formerly known as Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of Collinsville) completed its conversion from a federally-chartered
mutual savings association to a capital stock form of organization with the establishment of a stock holding company, Best Hometown
Bancorp, Inc. ( the Company ), as parent of the Bank. The stock holding company is organized under the laws of the
State of Maryland and owns all of the outstanding common stock of the Bank. The Company sold 826,208 shares of its common stock,
including 8% or 66,096 shares purchased by the Bank s employee stock ownership plan, at a price of $10.00 per share, for
gross offering proceeds of $8,300 that was used to buy its Company shares. The cost of the conversion and issuance of common
stock was $1,400, which was deducted from the gross offering proceeds. The Company contributed $5,000 of the net proceeds
from the offering to the Bank, and $1,200 was retained by the Company. In addition, $661 of the net proceeds were used
to fund the loan to the employee stock ownership plan. 

Voting rights are held and exercised exclusively
by the shareholders of the holding company. Deposit account holders continue to be insured by the FDIC. A liquidation account was
established in an amount equal to the Bank s total equity as of the latest balance sheet date in the final offering circular
used in the conversion. Each eligible account holder or supplemental account holder are entitled to a proportionate share of this
account in the event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event. This share will be reduced if the eligible
account holder s or supplemental account holder s deposit balance falls below the amounts on the date of record and
will cease to exist if the account is closed. The liquidation account will never be increased despite any increase after conversion
in the related deposit balance. 

The Bank may not pay a dividend on its
capital stock, if the effect thereof would cause retained earnings to be reduced below the liquidation account amount or regulatory
capital requirements. In addition, the stock holding company will be subject to certain regulations related to the repurchase of
its capital stock. 

The Conversion was accounted for as a change
in corporate form with the historic basis of the Bank s assets, liabilities and equity unchanged as a result. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, include Best Hometown Bancorp, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial
statements as of December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 represent the Bank only, as the conversion
to stock form, including the formation of Best Hometown Bancorp, Inc. was completed on June 29, 2016. References herein to the
Company for periods prior to the completion of the stock conversion should be deemed to refer to the Bank. 

The accompanying condensed balance sheet
of the Bank as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include information
or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2015
included in the Registrant s Form S-1. Reference is made to the accounting policies of the Bank described in the Notes to
Financial Statements contained in the Form S-1. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been included to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations
and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All interim amounts have not been audited and the
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, herein are not necessarily indicative of the results
of operations to be expected for the entire year. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 

Table of Contents   

BEST HOMETOWN BANCORP, INC.  

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

  (Amounts in thousands, except share and per
share data)  

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

Material estimates that are particularly susceptible
to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed real estate, fair values
of financial instruments, measurement of defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans and valuation of deferred tax
assets. 

(2) NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

The Company is an emerging growth Company
and may elect to adopt new or revised accounting standards using the effective dates applicable to nonpublic companies (if the
standard is applicable to nonpublic companies). This could impact the implementation dates of the standards noted below. 

On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, to address
certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU affects public and
private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and employee benefit plans that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved amendments deferring the effective
date by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within that reporting period. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued final amendments (ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10)
to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations and the accounting
for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued final amendments (ASU-11) to clarify guidance related
to collectability, noncash considerations, presentation of sales tax, and transition. The amendments can be applied retrospectively
to each prior reporting period or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this Update recognized at the
date of initial application. Early application is permitted but not before the original public entity effective date, i.e., annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company continues to assess the impact of ASU 2014-09 on its accounting and
disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326)   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. The provisions of ASU 2016-13 were issued to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information
about the expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including
loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other commitments
to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized
cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable incurred loss recognition in current GAAP and reflect
an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the financial assets. 

For purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant
amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ) that are measured at amortized cost, the initial allowance
for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Subsequent changes in the
allowance for credit losses on PCD assets are recognized through the statement of income as a credit loss expense. 

Credit losses relating to available-for-sale
debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security. 

ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of ASU 2016-13 on its accounting and disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). The update provides guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments
for presentation in the statement of cash flows. The amendment is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective
transition method to each period presented unless

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

  (Amounts in thousands, except share and per
share data)  

impracticable. The Company does not believe that
this new guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Other accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 

(3) EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE   

Based on the accounting method used for the
recording of the common stock transaction, including the funding of Best Hometown Bancorp, Inc., on June 29, 2016, together with
the methods and computations for calculating the weighted-average number of related outstanding shares and loss per share for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the computation of loss per share would not provide meaningful information to readers
of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, such presentation is not included for such periods. 

(4) AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE
SECURITIES 

Debt and mortgage-backed securities have been
classified as available-for-sale securities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets according to management s
intent. U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities-residential consist of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies
and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Investment securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, investment securities with a carrying value of $0 and $995 were pledged for public deposits. 

Table of Contents   

BEST HOMETOWN BANCORP, INC.  

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

  (Amounts in thousands, except share and per
share data)  

The following tables show
the fair value and unrealized loss of securities that have been in unrealized loss positions for less than twelve months and for
more than twelve months at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The tables also show the number of securities in an unrealized
loss position for each category of investment security as of the respective dates. 

(1)       Actual
amounts. 

The Company evaluates securities for other-than-temporary
impairments ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such
evaluation. The Company considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Additionally, the Company considers its intent to sell or whether it will be more
likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to the security's anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing
an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by federal Government agencies, whether
downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition. 

None of the unrealized losses at September
30, 2016 were recognized into net income for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 because the issuers  bonds
are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the
securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The
fair value of these securities is expected to recover as they approach their maturity date or reset date. None of the unrealized
losses at December 31, 2015 were recognized as having OTTI during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Because the actual cash flows for mortgage-backed
securities may differ from their contractual maturities, a maturity table is not shown. At December 31, 2015, the amortized cost
and fair value of U.S. agency bonds with contractual maturities due from one to five years was $500 and $501, respectively and
the amortized cost and fair value of U.S. agency bonds with contractual maturities due after ten years was $500 and $494, respectively. 

The following table presents the gross proceeds
from sales of securities available-for-sale and gains or losses recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015:

The Company establishes the unallocated allowance
for loan losses due to uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component
of the allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover probable and incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but
not captured in the general component, such as historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to individual
loan portfolio segments and to uncertainties in economic conditions.

Impaired loans with identified losses have
been reduced by partial charge-offs and are carried at their estimated net realizable value. The Company believes no further allowance
for loan losses were necessary at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The following table presents
loans that have been modified as troubled debt restructurings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

No additional allowance has been specifically
reserved for these loans. Additionally, there were no commitments to lend any additional amounts under either loan or any payment
default on any loan after the modification. There were no troubled debt restructurings during the three or nine months ended September
30, 2016. There were no troubled restructurings that were restructured in the last 12 months that defaulted during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.

Loan Grades:  

The Company utilizes a grading system whereby
all loans are assigned a grade based on the risk profile of each loan. Loan grades are determined based on an evaluation of relevant
information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience,
credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. All loans, regardless of size, are
analyzed and are given a grade based upon the management s assessment of the ability of borrowers to service their debts. 

Pass:  Loan assets of this grade conform
to a preponderance of our underwriting criteria and are acceptable as a credit risk, based upon the current net worth and paying
capacity of the obligor. Loans in this category also include loans secured by liquid assets and secured loans to borrowers with
unblemished credit histories. 

Pass-Watch:  Loan assets of this grade
represent our minimum level of acceptable credit risk. This grade may also represent obligations previously rated  Pass ,
but with significantly deteriorating trends or previously rated. 

Special Mention: Loan assets of this grade
have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may
result in deterioration of repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard:  Loan assets of this grade
are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans
so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by
the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful:  Loans classified as doubtful
have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Portfolio Segments:  

One-to-four family, owner occupied, including construction and
land:  One-to-four family, owner occupied loans and construction and land loans are underwritten based on the applicant s
employment and credit history and the appraised value of the property. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal
income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment
can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties. Land loans are secured primarily by unimproved land
for future residential use. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large
number of borrowers. 

One-to-four family, non-owner occupied:  One-to-four family,
non-owner occupied loans carry greater inherent risks than one-to-four family, owner occupied loans, since the repayment ability
of the borrower is generally reliant on the success of the income generated from the property. 

Commercial and multi-family real estate:  Commercial real
estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, churches and various income-producing properties. Multi-family real estate
loans are secured by generally apartment complexes. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are underwritten based on the
economic viability of the property and creditworthiness of the borrower, with emphasis given to projected cash flow as a percentage
of debt service requirements. These loans carry increased risks as they involve larger balances concentrated with single borrowers
or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties depends on the successful operation of
the real estate and the economy. 

Commercial business:  Commercial business loans are primarily
based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash
flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial
business loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and
may include a personal guarantee. Short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis.

Commercial business loans carry significant
credit risks as they involve larger balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, repayment
of such loans depends on the successful operation of the business for which an operating loan is utilized. 

Consumer:  Consumer loans include automobile, personal and
other consumer loans. Potential credit risks include rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, which could adversely affect
the value of the collateral.

OWNERSHIP PLAN 

Employees participate in an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ( ESOP ). The ESOP borrowed from the Company to purchase 66,096 shares of the Company s common
stock at $10 per share on June 29, 2016. The Company may make discretionary contributions to the ESOP and pay dividends on unallocated
shares to the ESOP, the ESOP uses funds it receives to repay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to
participants based on relative compensation and expense is recorded. Any dividends on allocated shares increase participant accounts.
Participants receive the shares at the end of employment. 

No contributions to the ESOP were made during
the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. The expense recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $10 and is reported in salaries and wages.

for the defined benefit pension plan, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
segregated by the level of the inputs (as defined in Note 8) within the hierarchy used to measure fair value: 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, benefits paid, employer contributions and the actual return on plan assets for the defined benefit pension plan were $204,
$172 and $176, respectively. 

The Company s defined benefit pension
plan target allocations and weighted-average allocations by asset category are as follows: 

The Company s investment strategy is
to maintain a diversified investment portfolio. Rebalancing occurs on a periodic basis to maintain the target allocations, but
normal market activity may result in deviations. As a result of the percentage of equities held, actual return of plan assets for
any period may fluctuate significantly due to changes in the stock market.

(8) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Fair value is the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than
Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect
a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

Investment Securities:  

The fair values for investment securities are
determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are
calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar
securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3).

Impaired Loans:  

The fair value of impaired loans with specific
allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize
a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are
routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data
available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair
value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements,
or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the
time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a
Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 

Real Estate Owned:  

Assets acquired through or instead of loan
foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Fair value is
commonly based on recent real estate appraisals, which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize
a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are
routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and
income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs
for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted
accordingly. 

Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired
loans and real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential
appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once
received, management reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value
in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. On an annual basis, the Company
compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold to the most recent appraised value to determine what additional
adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. 

Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below:

Presented in the table below
are assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The Company's impaired loans at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were measured at fair value based primarily upon the estimated value of real estate collateral
less costs to sell. The carrying amounts of these loans were $10 and $281, respectively. Impairments are generally
charged off against the allowance for loan loss; therefore, there are no specific valuation allowances carried on these loans
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The amount charged off related to these impaired loans for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015 was $29 and $117, respectively. 

Real estate owned is carried at the lower
of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. The carrying value of real estate owned September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 were $24 and $667. The resulting write-downs for measuring real estate owned at the lower of carrying or fair value
less costs to sell for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $16.
There were no write downs of real estate owned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Many of the Company s assets and liabilities
are short-term financial instruments whose carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet approximate fair value and
are considered Level 1 assets and liabilities. These items include cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and payable
balances, variable rate loan and deposits that re-price frequently and fully. The estimated fair values of the Company s
remaining on-balance sheet financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below: 

(1) It is not practicable to determine fair value of restricted
equity securities due to restrictions placed on transferability. 

The following methods and
assumptions were used in estimating the fair values shown above: 

Loans:  

The fair value of loans is computed for each
loan category using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 

Deposits:  

Deposits with no defined maturities, such as
checking accounts, savings accounts and money market deposit accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand
at the balance sheet date. The fair values of certificate accounts are computed using interest rates currently being offered to
deposit customers. 

FHLB advances:  

FHLB advances are valued at current market
interest rates of FHLB advances.

The following factors, among
others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking
statements: 

general economic conditions, either nationally or in our
market areas, that are worse than expected; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;   

adverse changes in the securities markets; 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees
and capital requirements;

changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Registrant s Form S-1 as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015  

Our total assets increased $9.4 million, or
9.5%, to $108.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $98.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in total assets is reflective
of the net proceeds of $6.2 million from our common stock offering in connection with our conversion from a mutual savings bank
to a stock bank and an increase in our total deposits of $6.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. A portion
of the additional funds were used to increase our portfolio of commercial and multi-family loans. However, repayments of one-to-four
family, owner occupied loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 offset the increase of commercial and multi-family
loans. Additionally, the increase in funds from our stock offering proceeds and increased deposits were invested in high-quality
U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities during the period. 

Gross loans decreased $648,000, or 0.86%, to
$74.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $75.5 million at December 31, 2015. Our commercial and multi-family loans increased by
$2.3 million, or 15.8%, to $16.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $14.6 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in gross loans
reflected the decrease in our one-to-four family, owner occupied loans. One-to-four family, owner occupied loans decreased $3.6
million, or 7.0%, to $48.2 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $51.9 million at December 31, 2015. As part of our business
strategy, we intend to increase our emphasis on short-term commercial and multi-family real estate loans and to a lesser extent,
increase our commercial business loans and consumer loans and decrease our emphasis on lending for long-term one-to-four family
loans. 

Available-for-sale securities
increased $13.9 million, or 124.1%, to $25.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $11.2 million at December 31, 2015. The increase
reflected our investment of excess funds in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities. Management believes that mortgage-backed
securities will provide the best yield on available funds and a return of invested cash from principal pay-down until we are
able to deploy such additional funds into commercial and multi-family real estate loans. 

Real estate owned, net decreased $643,000,
or 96.4%, to $24,000 at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to the successful sale of properties 

Our deposits increased $6.7 million, or 8.4%,
to $86.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $80.0 million at December 31, 2015. The increase reflected the Company s strategy
in attracting primarily 4 and 5-year certificates of deposit to improve our long-term interest rate risk position. Certificates
of deposit increased to $63.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $59.2 million at December 31, 2015. Core deposits, which include
noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts, increased to $24.4 million at September
30, 2016 from $20.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase reflected our new interest-bearing checking and money market accounts.
We intend to increase our core deposits, in particular, checking and money market accounts, through our existing and new commercial
loan customers and aggressive marketing efforts. 

FHLB advances decreased to $6.0 million at
September 30, 2016 from $9.0 million at December 31, 2015. In January 2016, we repaid a matured $3.0 million advance with a cost
of 3.90%, using funds from cash and cash equivalents. During July 2016, we refinanced a maturing $5.0 million advance, with an
interest rate of 4.62% with $5.0 million of FHLB advances with an average rate of approximately 1.99%. 

Shareholders  equity increased to $12.8
million at September 30, 2016 from $6.9 million at December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the completion of the mutual to
stock conversion and resulting proceeds from the sale of common stock of $6.2 million and decrease in accumulated other
comprehensive losses, partially offset by a net loss of $408,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Interest income that would have been recorded
had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms and the actual amount collected for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,000 and $6,000, respectively. 

Interest income that would have been recorded
had our trouble debt restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $12,000 and $20,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Interest of $9,000 and $19,000 respectively, was recognized on these loans and is included
in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The decrease in nonperforming assets is a reflection

Comparison of Operating Results for the
Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General.   We reported a net loss of $123,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $107,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in net loss was primarily attributed to an increase in professional and supervisory fees and FDIC
deposit insurance. Professional and supervisory fees increased by $69,000, or 107.8%, to $133,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $64,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in professional and
supervisory fees is related to the increased costs associated with our conversion to a public company. FDIC deposit insurance
increased by $49,000, or 175.0%, to $21,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. FDIC premium expense decreased
substantially during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of a lower assessment rate due to our improved
risk category. 

Interest Income.   Interest income increased $10,000,
or 1.1%, to $883,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $873,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in interest income is reflective of an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets, which increased
to $104.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $92.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets is reflective of the increase in cash of $6.2 million in net proceeds
from of our stock offering in connection with our mutual-to-stock conversion and increasing deposit levels during 2016. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, the average balance of loans increased
to $74.5 million from $72.7 million, the average balance of investments increased to $20.6 million from $13.5 million, and the
average balance of interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased to $9.8 million from $6.0 million. These increases
in average balances offset the decrease in the overall yield for each interest-earning asset. The average yields on interest-earning
assets decreased 42 basis points to 3.37% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.79% for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Over these same periods, our loan yield decreased 18 basis points to 4.37% from 4.55%, and our investment
yield decreased 11 basis points to 1.14% from 1.25%. The decrease in yields on both loans and investments is reflective of the
sustained historically low interest rate environment and very competitive lending environment in our market area. 

Interest Expense .  Interest expense increased $11,000,
or 3.7%, to $311,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $300,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in interest expense was caused by both an increase in the average balances of deposits of $11.6 million, or 16.5%,
to $82.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $70.4 million for the same period ended September 30, 2015
and an increase in the average rate paid on deposits to 1.31% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.13% for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. This 18 basis point increase is reflective of our marketing strategy to attract new depositors
within our market area and retain existing customers post conversion. The increase in interest expense from deposits was offset,
partially, by a decrease in interest expense from FHLB advances, which is related to the maturity of $3.0 million of our advances
during the first quarter of 2016 and refinancing existing advances with lower rates. Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased
$58,000, or 56.9%, to $44,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 from $102,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. 

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income decreased
$1,000, or 0.17%, to $572,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease is reflective of the decrease
in our net interest margin of 30 basis points to 2.18% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.49% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing
liabilities. 

Provision for Loan Losses.    There was no provision
for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. Even though we have seen a nominal increase in nonperforming
loans, our level of impaired loans has declined from $1.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $914,000 at September 30, 2016, and
our total loans restructured have decreased from four loans in the amount of $488,000 to 1 loan for $89,000. Additionally, we
have seen a decline in our gross charge-offs as gross charge offs declined to $29,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $52,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Our total allowance for loans losses was 1.6%
of total gross loans at September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.7% at December 31, 2015. We do not have an allowance for specifically
identified impaired loans as we generally charge off identified impairments on impaired loans to the allowance for loan losses
to a net realizable value on those loans. We do maintain an unallocated portion in our general allowance that we believe represents
those probable incurred losses within our loan portfolio not specifically identified with any particular portfolio segment. We
believe that with our increased emphasis on commercial lending as opposed to mortgage lending there are inherent credit risks that
we have not yet quantified through historical experience.

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income increased $28,000,
or 87.5%, to $60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $32,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase is attributable to net gains realized on the sale of real estate owned properties of $20,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net gains realized of $8,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and an increase
in other noninterest income to $26,000 from $3,000 for the same periods ended. The increase in other noninterest income is primarily
attributable to an increase in miscellaneous loan administrative fees. 

Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest expense increased $43,000,
or 6.0%, to $755,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $712,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase is reflective of increases in professional and supervisory fees and FDIC deposit insurance. Professional and supervisory
fees increased by $69,000, or 107.8%, to $133,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $64,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in professional and supervisory fees is related to the increased costs associated with
our conversion to a public company. FDIC deposit insurance increased by $49,000, or 175.0%, to $21,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. FDIC premium expense decreased substantially during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a
result of a lower assessment rate due to our improved risk category. These increases in noninterest expenses more than
offset a decrease of $95,000, or 20.4%, in salaries and employee benefits to $370,000 from $465,000 for the same
periods ended. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits reflects several higher salaried employees that were employed by
the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2015 that were no longer employed during the same period in 2016. 

Income Tax Expense.   There was no provision
for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. A valuation allowance has been recorded against
all components of the net deferred tax asset, except for the unrealized loss on available for sale securities, based upon our cumulative
operating losses in recent years. 

The deferred tax asset will only be recognized
in future periods upon the Company s ability to realize and maintain profitable results of operations. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General.   We reported a net loss of $408,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $389,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in net loss was primarily attributed to a decrease in noninterest income of $85,000, or 44.7%, to $105,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $190,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which more than offset the increase
in net interest income before the provision for loan losses of $32,000 and the decrease in noninterest expense of
$16,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Income.   Interest income increased $125,000
or 5.0%, to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in interest income is reflective of an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets, which increased
to $99.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $90.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets is reflective of the increase in cash from the $6.2 million in
net proceeds from of our stock offering in connection with our mutual-to-stock conversion and an increase in total deposits of
$6.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was deployed into interest-earning assets. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the average balance of loans increased to $74.1
million from $69.0 million, the average balance of investments increased to $15.8 million from $12.9 million, and the average
balance of interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased to $9.5 million from $8.9 million. These increases in average
balances offset the decrease in the overall yield for each interest-earning asset. The average yields on interest-earning assets
decreased 15 basis points to 3.53% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.68% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Over these same periods, our loan yield decreased 16 basis points to 4.40% from 4.56%, and our investment yield decreased
9 basis points to 1.32% from 1.41%. The decrease in yields on both loans and investments is reflective of the sustained historically
low interest rate environment and very competitive lending environment in our market area. 

Interest Expense .  Interest expense increased $93,000,
or 10.9%, to $948,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $855,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in interest expense was caused by both an increase in the average balances of deposits of $10.6 million, or 15.3%,
to $80.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $69.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
and an increase in the average rate paid on deposits to 1.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.06% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This 21 basis point increase in the average rate paid is reflective of our marketing
strategy to attract new depositors within our market area and retain existing customers post conversion. The increase in interest
expense from deposits was offset, partially, by a decrease in interest expense from FHLB advances, which is related to the maturity
of $3.0 million of our advances during the first quarter of 2016 and refinancing existing FHLB advances with lower rates. Interest
expense on FHLB advances decreased $116,000, or 38.4%, to $186,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 from $302,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Table of Contents   

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased,
$32,000, or 1.9%, to $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The nominal increase is reflective of a consistent
average interest-earning assets to average interest-earning liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to September 30, 2015. 

Provision for Loan Losses.    We recorded no provision
for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $18,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Even though we have seen a nominal increase in nonperforming loans, our level of impaired loans has declined from $1.9 million
at December 31, 2015 to $914,000 at September 30, 2016, and our total loans restructured have decreased from four loans in the
amount of $488,000 to 1 loan for $89,000. 

Our total allowance for loans losses was 1.6%
of total gross loans at September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.7% at December 31, 2015. We do not have an allowance for specifically
identified impaired loans as we generally charge off identified impairments on impaired loans to the allowance for loan losses
to a net realizable value on those loans. We do maintain an unallocated portion in our general allowance that we believe represents
those probable incurred losses within our loan portfolio not specifically identified with any particular portfolio segment. We
believe that with our increased emphasis on commercial lending as opposed to mortgage lending there are inherent credit risks that
we have not yet quantified through historical experience. 

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income decreased $85,000,
or 44.7%, to $105,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $190,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease is due primarily to a larger gain on sale of real estate owned during the nine months ended September 2015 of $120,000
as compared to $10,000 for the nine months ended September 2016. We have successfully sold all but one real estate owned property
in the amount of $24,000 at September 30, 2016. 

Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest expense decreased modestly
by $16,000, or 0.72%, to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease reflected the decrease
in salaries and employee benefits of $115,000, or 9.4%, to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits reflects several higher salaried
employees that were employed by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 that were no longer employed during
the same period in 2016. The decrease in salaries and employee beneifts was offset partially by an increase in professional and
supervisory fees of $80,000, or 33.1%, to $322,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $242,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increaese in professional and supervisory fees reflects the increased cost with
being a public company. 

Income Tax Expense.  
There was no provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. A valuation allowance
has been recorded against all components of the net deferred tax asset, except for the unrealized loss on available for sale securities,
based upon our cumulative operating losses in recent years. 

The deferred tax asset
will only be recognized in future periods upon the Company s ability to realize and maintain profitable results of operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit
inflows, loan repayments, FHLB advances, and repayments, maturities and calls of investment securities. While maturities and scheduled
amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced
by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for establishing and
monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs
and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity
to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2016. 

We regularly monitor and adjust our investments
in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (i) expected loan demand; (ii) expected deposit flows; (iii) yields available on
interest-earning deposits and securities; and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets
are invested generally in interest-earning and non interest-earning deposits and short- and medium-term securities. 

Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term
function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist
with the FHLB, which provides an additional source of funds. Our FHLB advances totaled $6.0 million at September 30, 2016.
In addition, the Company had entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit with the FHLB of $3.2
million at September 30, 2016 to secure public deposits. At September 30, 2016, we had the ability to borrow up to
an additional $33.2 million from the FHLB, subject to pledging additional
collateral. We also have an unused open line of credit at The Independent BankersBank that would allow us to borrow up to $2.5
million at September 30, 2016. 

Table of Contents   

The Company is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital
and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk
categories. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Company
is considered  well capitalized  under regulatory guidelines. 

The net proceeds from the stock offering significantly
increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the
stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of new loans. Our results of operations will be enhanced
by the net proceeds from the stock offering, resulting in increased net interest income. However, due to the increase in equity
resulting from the net proceeds raised in the stock offering, our return on equity will be adversely affected. 

ITEM
3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

ITEM
4.  Controls and Procedures   

An evaluation was performed
under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bank s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September

Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
