corresponding benchmark. Each  Ultra  Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks investment
results (before fees and expenses), both over a single day and over time, that match the performance of its corresponding benchmark. Daily performance is measured from the calculation of one NAV to the next.  
 The Geared Funds do not seek to achieve their stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding
prevents the Geared Funds from achieving such results. Accordingly, results over periods of time greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple multiple (e.g., -1x, -2x or 2x) of the period return of the corresponding benchmark and
will likely differ significantly.    The Matching VIX Funds seek to achieve their stated investment objective both over a single day and over time.  
 Each of the Funds generally invests in Financial Instruments (i.e., instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, rate or index,
including futures contracts, swap agreements, forward contracts and other instruments) as a substitute for investing directly in commodities, currencies, or spot volatility products in order to gain exposure to its applicable underlying commodity
futures index, commodity, currency exchange rate or equity volatility index. Financial Instruments also are used to produce economically  inverse,   inverse leveraged  or  leveraged  investment results for the Geared
Funds.     Share Splits and Reverse Share Splits     The
table below includes Share splits and reverse Share splits for the Funds during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The ticker symbols for these Funds did not change, and each Fund continues to
trade on the NYSE Arca.      
   The reverse splits were applied retroactively for all periods presented, reducing the number of Shares outstanding for each of
the Funds, and resulted in a proportionate increase in the price per Share and per Share information of each such Fund. Therefore, the reverse splits did not change the aggregate net asset value of a shareholder s investment at the time of the
reverse split.    The splits were applied retroactively for all periods presented, increasing the number of Shares outstanding for each of the Funds, and
resulted in a proportionate decrease in the price per Share and per Share information of each such Fund. Therefore, the splits did not change the aggregate net asset value of a shareholder s investment at the time of the split.

   NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 Each Fund is an investment company, as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946  Financial
Services   Investment Companies.  As such, the Funds follow the investment company accounting and reporting guidance. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by each Fund, as applicable, in preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form
10-Q and the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been
made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Trust s and the Funds  financial statements included in
the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.     Use of
Estimates   Indemnifications     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in these financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    In the
normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Trust s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be known; however, the Trust expects any
risk of loss to be remote.     Basis of Presentation   
 Pursuant to rules and regulations of the SEC, financial statements are presented for the Trust as a whole, as the SEC registrant, and for each Fund
individually. The debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Fund shall be enforceable only against the assets of such Fund and not against the assets of the Trust
generally or any other Fund. Accordingly, the assets of one Fund of the Trust include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the Trust for the purchase of Shares in that Fund.  
  Statement of Cash Flows     The cash amount shown in the
Statements of Cash Flows is the amount reported as cash in the Statement of Financial Condition dated September 30, 2016, and represents non-segregated cash with the custodian and does not include short-term investments.  
  Final Net Asset Value for Fiscal Period     The cut-off
times and the times of the calculation of the Funds  final net asset value for creation and redemption of fund Shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows. All times are Eastern Standard Time:  

98  

Table of Contents  

* 
 Although the Funds  shares may continue to trade on secondary markets subsequent to the calculation of the final NAV, these times represent the final opportunity to transact in creation or redemption units for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Market value per Share is determined at the close of the NYSE Arca and may be later than when
the Funds  NAV per Share is calculated.    For financial reporting purposes, the Funds value transactions based upon the final closing price in their
primary markets. Accordingly, the investment valuations in these financial statements may differ from those used in the calculation of certain of the Funds  final creation/redemption NAV for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016.     Investment Valuation     Short-term investments
are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value for daily NAV purposes. For financial reporting purposes, short-term investments are valued at their market price using information provided by a third-party pricing service or market
quotations. In each of these situations, valuations are typically categorized as Level I in the fair value hierarchy.    Derivatives ( e.g. , futures
contracts, swap agreements, forward agreements and foreign currency forward contracts) are generally valued using independent sources and/or agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined by the Sponsor. Futures contracts, except
for those entered into by the Gold, Silver, Australian Dollar and Short Euro Funds, are generally valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades. Futures contracts entered into by the Gold, Silver, Australian
Dollar and Short Euro Funds are valued at the last sales price prior to the time at which the NAV per Share of a Fund is determined. For financial reporting purposes, all futures contracts are valued at the last settled price. Futures contracts
valuations are typically categorized as Level I in the fair value hierarchy. Swap agreements, forward agreements and foreign currency forward contracts valuations are typically categorized as Level II in the fair value hierarchy. If there was no
sale on that day, and for non-exchange-traded derivatives, the Sponsor may in its sole discretion choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market value of such position for such day. Such fair value prices would
generally be determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with
industry standards. When market closing prices are not available, the Sponsor may fair value an asset of a Fund pursuant to the policies the Sponsor has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. Depending on the source and
relevant significance of valuation inputs, these instruments may be classified as Level II or Level III in the fair value hierarchy.    Fair value pricing
may require subjective determinations about the value of an investment. While the Funds  policies are intended to result in a calculation of its respective Fund s NAV that fairly reflects investment values as of the time of pricing, such
Fund cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Sponsor or persons acting at their direction would accurately reflect the price that a Fund could obtain for an investment if it were to dispose of that investment as of the time of pricing (for
instance, in a forced or distressed sale). The prices used by such Fund may differ from the value that would be realized if the investments were sold and the differences could be material to the financial statements.

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 The Funds disclose the fair value of their investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
disclosure requirements establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Funds (observable inputs); and (2) the
Funds  own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The three levels defined by the disclosure requirements hierarchy are as follows:  
 Level I   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to
access at the measurement date.    Level II   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II assets include the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).  
 Level III   Unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure
fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.    In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
   Fair value measurements also require additional disclosure when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased,
as well as when circumstances indicate that a transaction is not orderly.    The following table summarizes the valuation of investments at
September 30, 2016 using the fair value hierarchy:

unobservable inputs were used to determine fair value.    The Funds  policy is to recognize transfers between valuation levels at the end of the
reporting period.    At September 30, 2016, there were no significant transfers in or out of Level I and Level II fair value measurements.  
 The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

  Investment Transactions and Related Income     Investment
transactions are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized appreciation/depreciation on open contracts are reflected in the Statements of Financial Condition
and changes in the unrealized appreciation/depreciation between periods are reflected in the Statements of Operations. Discounts on short-term securities purchased are amortized and reflected as Interest Income in the Statements of Operations.  
  Brokerage Commissions and Fees     Each Fund pays its
respective brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, National Futures Association ( NFA ) fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities
for each Fund s investment in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) regulated investments. The effects of trading spreads, financing costs/fees associated with Financial Instruments, and costs relating to the purchase of
U.S. Treasury securities or similar high credit quality short-term fixed-income or similar securities would also be borne by the Funds. Brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis (e.g., the first half is
recognized when the contract is purchased (opened) and the second half is recognized when the transaction is closed). Through July 30, 2014, the Sponsor paid brokerage commissions on VIX futures contracts for the Matching VIX Funds. On
July 31, 2014, the Sponsor began paying, and is currently paying, brokerage commissions on VIX futures contracts for the Matching VIX Funds that exceed variable create/redeem fees collected by more than 0.02% of the Matching VIX Fund s
average net assets annually.     Federal Income Tax   
 Each Fund is registered as a series of a Delaware statutory trust and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no Fund
expects to incur U.S. federal income tax liability; rather, each beneficial owner of a Fund s Shares is required to take into account its allocable share of its Fund s income, gain, loss, deductions and other items for its Fund s
taxable year ending with or within the beneficial owner s taxable year.  
      102  

Table of Contents  

  Management of the Funds has reviewed all open tax years and major jurisdictions ( i.e. , the last four tax
year ends and the interim tax period since then, as applicable) and concluded that there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns. The
Funds are also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. On an ongoing basis, management will monitor its tax positions
taken under the interpretation to determine if adjustments to conclusions are necessary based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of tax law, regulation, and interpretations thereof.  
  NOTE 3   INVESTMENTS      Short-Term Investments
    The Funds may purchase U.S. Treasury Bills, agency securities, and other high-credit quality short-term fixed income or similar securities with
original maturities of one year or less. A portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements and/or used as collateral for a Fund s trading in futures and forward contracts.  
  Accounting for Derivative Instruments     In seeking to
achieve each Fund s investment objective, the Sponsor uses a mathematical approach to investing. Using this approach, the Sponsor determines the type, quantity and mix of investment positions, including derivative positions, which the Sponsor
believes in combination, should produce returns consistent with a Fund s objective.    All open derivative positions at period end are reflected on
each respective Fund s Schedule of Investments. Certain Funds utilized a varying level of derivative instruments in conjunction with investment securities in seeking to meet their investment objective during the period. While the volume of open
positions may vary on a daily basis as each Fund transacts derivatives contracts in order to achieve the appropriate exposure to meet its investment objective, the volume of these open positions relative to the net assets of each respective Fund at
the date of this report is generally representative of open positions throughout the reporting period.    Following is a description of the derivative
instruments used by the Funds during the reporting period, including the primary underlying risk exposures related to each instrument type.     Futures
Contracts     The Funds enter into futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the value of, or as a substitute for investing directly in (or
shorting), an underlying index, currency or commodity. A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of asset at a specified time and place. The contractual
obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity, if applicable, or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange
before the designated date of delivery, or by cash settlement at expiration of contract.    Upon entering into a futures contract, each Fund is required to
deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the transaction is affected. The initial margin is segregated as cash and/or securities balances with brokers for futures contracts, as disclosed in
the Statements of Financial Condition, and is restricted as to its use. The Funds that enter into futures contracts maintain collateral at the broker in the form of cash and/or securities. Pursuant to the futures contract, each Fund generally agrees
to receive from or pay to the broker(s) an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by each Fund as unrealized gains or losses. Each Fund
will realize a gain or loss upon closing of a futures transaction.    Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically
commodity price risk or equity market volatility risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin. The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure each Fund has in the particular classes of instruments.
Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying index or commodity and the possibility of an illiquid market for a
futures contract. With futures contracts, there is minimal but some counterparty risk to the Funds since futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange s clearinghouse, as counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts,
guarantees the futures contracts against default. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a
 
      103  

Table of Contents  

particular contract, no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified times during the trading day. Futures contracts prices could move to the
limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting a Fund to substantial losses. If trading is not possible, or if a Fund determines not to
close a futures position in anticipation of adverse price movements, the Fund will be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin. The risk the Fund will be unable to close out a futures position will be minimized by entering into such
transactions on a national exchange with an active and liquid secondary market.     Swap Agreements   
 Certain of the Funds enter into swap agreements for purposes of pursuing their investment objectives or as a substitute for investing directly in (or shorting)
an underlying index, currency or commodity, or to create an economic hedge against a position. Swap agreements are two-party contracts that have traditionally been entered into primarily with institutional investors in over-the-counter
( OTC ) markets for a specified period, ranging from a day to more than one year. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) provides for significant reforms of the OTC
derivative markets, including a requirement to execute certain swap transactions on a CFTC-regulated market and/or to clear such transactions through a CFTC-regulated central clearing organization. In a standard swap transaction, two parties agree
to exchange the returns earned or realized on a particular predetermined investment, instrument or index in exchange for a fixed or floating rate of return in respect of a predetermined notional amount. Transaction or commission costs are reflected
in the benchmark level at which the transaction is entered into. The gross returns to be exchanged are calculated with respect to a notional amount and the benchmark returns to which the swap is linked. Swap agreements do not involve the delivery of
underlying instruments.    Generally, swap agreements entered into by the Funds calculate and settle the obligations of the parties to the agreement on a
 net basis  with a single payment. Consequently, each Fund s current obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values
of such obligations (or rights) (the  net amount ). In a typical swap agreement entered into by a Matching VIX Fund or an Ultra Fund, the Matching VIX Fund or Ultra Fund would be entitled to settlement payments in the event the level of
the benchmark increases and would be required to make payments to the swap counterparties in the event the level of the benchmark decreases, adjusted for any transaction costs or trading spreads on the notional amount the Funds may pay. In a typical
swap agreement entered into by a Short Fund or an UltraShort Fund, the Short Fund or UltraShort Fund would be required to make payments to the swap counterparties in the event the level of the benchmark increases and would be entitled to settlement
payments in the event the level of the benchmark decreases, adjusted for any transaction costs or trading spreads on the notional amount the Funds may pay.  
 The net amount of the excess, if any, of each Fund s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each uncleared swap agreement is accrued on a
daily basis and an amount of cash and/or securities having an aggregate value at least equal to such accrued excess is maintained for the benefit of the counterparty in a segregated account by the Funds  Custodian. The net amount of the excess,
if any, of each Fund s entitlements over its obligations with respect to each uncleared swap agreement is accrued on a daily basis and an amount of cash and/or securities having an aggregate value at least equal to such accrued excess is
maintained for the benefit of the Fund in a segregated account by the Fund s Custodian. Until a swap agreement is settled in cash, the gain or loss on the notional amount less any transaction costs or trading spreads payable by each Fund on the
notional amount are recorded as  unrealized appreciation or depreciation on swap agreements  and, when cash is exchanged, the gain or loss realized is recorded as  realized gains or losses on swap agreements.  Swap agreements are
generally valued at the last settled price of the benchmark referenced asset.    The Trust, on behalf of a Fund, may enter into agreements with certain
counterparties for derivative transactions. These agreements contain various conditions, events of default, termination events, covenants and representations. The triggering of certain events or the default on certain terms of the agreement could
allow a party to terminate a transaction under the agreement and request immediate payment in an amount equal to the net positions owed the party under the agreement. This could cause a Fund to have to enter into a new transaction with the same
counterparty, enter into a transaction with a different counterparty or seek to achieve its investment objective through any number of different investments or investment techniques.  
 Swap agreements involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk and exposure to loss in excess of the unrealized gain/loss reflected. The notional
amounts reflect the extent of the total investment exposure each Fund has under the swap agreement, which may exceed the NAV of each Fund. Additional risks associated with the use of swap agreements are imperfect correlations between movements in
the notional amount and the price of the underlying reference index and the inability of counterparties to perform. Each  
      104  

Table of Contents  

Fund bears the risk of loss of the amount expected to be received under a swap agreement in the event of the default or bankruptcy of a swap agreement counterparty. A Fund will typically enter
into swap agreements only with major global financial institutions. The creditworthiness of each of the firms that is a party to a swap agreement is monitored by the Sponsor. The Sponsor may use various techniques to minimize credit risk including
early termination and payment, using different counterparties, limiting the net amount due from any individual counterparty and generally requiring collateral to be posted by the counterparty in an amount approximately equal to that owed to the
Funds. All of the outstanding swap agreements at September 30, 2016 contractually terminate within one month but may be terminated without penalty by either party daily. Upon termination, the Fund is entitled to pay or receive the
 unrealized appreciation or depreciation  amount.    The Funds, as applicable, collateralize swap agreements by segregating or designating cash
and/or certain securities as indicated on the Statements of Financial Condition or Schedules of Investments. As noted above, collateral posted in connection with uncleared derivative transactions is held for the benefit of the counterparty in a
segregated tri-party account at the Custodian to protect the counterparty against non-payment by the Funds. In the event of a default by the counterparty, the Funds will seek withdrawal of this collateral from the segregated account and may incur
certain costs in exercising its right with respect to the collateral. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, the Funds may experience significant delays in obtaining any
recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganizational proceeding. The Funds may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.  
 The Funds remain subject to credit risk with respect to the amount they expect to receive from counterparties. However, the Funds have sought to mitigate
these risks in connection with uncleared swaps by generally requiring that the counterparties for each Fund agree to post collateral for the benefit of the Fund, marked to market daily, in an amount approximately equal to what the counterparty owes
the Fund, subject to certain minimum thresholds. In the event of the bankruptcy of a counterparty, the Fund will have direct access to the collateral received from the counterparty, generally as of the day prior to the bankruptcy, because there is a
one day time lag between the Fund s request for collateral and the delivery of such collateral. To the extent any such collateral is insufficient, the Funds will be exposed to counterparty risk as described above, including the possible delays
in recovering amounts as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. As of September 30, 2016, the collateral posted by counterparties consisted of cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities.  
 The counterparty/credit risk for cleared derivative transactions is generally lower than for uncleared OTC derivatives since generally a clearing organization
becomes substituted for each counterparty to a cleared derivative contract and, in effect, guarantees the parties  performance under the contract as each party to a trade looks only to the clearing organization for performance of financial
obligations. In addition, cleared derivative transactions benefit from daily marking-to-market and settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries.  
  Forward Contracts     Certain of the Funds enter into
forward contracts for purposes of pursuing their investment objectives and as a substitute for investing directly in (or shorting) commodities and/or currencies. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to purchase or sell a specified
quantity of an asset at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price. Forward contracts are typically traded in OTC markets and all details of the contract are negotiated between the counterparties to the agreement. Accordingly, the
forward contracts are valued by reference to the contracts traded in the OTC markets.    The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be
satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or currency, establishing an opposite position in the contract and recognizing the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date or, in some
instances, paying a cash settlement before the designated date of delivery. The forward contracts are adjusted by the daily fluctuation of the underlying commodity or currency and any gains or losses are recorded for financial statement purposes as
unrealized gains or losses until the contract settlement date.    Forward contracts have traditionally not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party. As a
result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC now regulates non-deliverable forwards (including deliverable forwards where the parties do not take delivery). Certain non-deliverable forward contracts, such as non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards, may
be subject to regulation as swap agreements, including mandatory clearing. Changes in the forward markets may entail increased costs and result in burdensome reporting requirements.  
      105  

Table of Contents  

  The Funds may collateralize uncleared forward commodity contracts by segregating or designating cash and/or
certain securities as indicated on their Statements of Financial Condition or Schedules of Investments. Such collateral is held for the benefit of the counterparty in a segregated tri-party account at the Custodian to protect the counterparty
against non-payment by the Funds. In the event of a default by the counterparty, the Funds will seek withdrawal of this collateral from the segregated account and may incur certain costs in exercising its right with respect to the collateral. If a
counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, the Funds may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganizational proceeding. The Funds may
obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.    The Funds remain subject to credit risk with respect to the amount they
expect to receive from counterparties. However, the Funds have sought to mitigate these risks by generally requiring that the counterparties for each Fund agree to post collateral for the benefit of the Fund, marked to market daily, in an amount
approximately equal to what the counterparty owes the Fund, subject to minimum thresholds. In the event of the bankruptcy of counterparty, the Fund will have direct access to the collateral received from the counterparty, generally as of the day
prior to the bankruptcy, because there is a one day time lag between the Fund s request for collateral and the delivery of such collateral. To the extent any such collateral is insufficient, the Fund will be exposed to counterparty risk as
described above, including the possible delays in recovering amounts as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. As of September 30, 2016, the collateral posted by counterparties consisted of cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities.  
 Participants in trading foreign exchange forward contracts often do not require margin deposits, but rely upon internal credit limitations and their judgments
regarding the creditworthiness of their counterparties. In recent years, however, many OTC market participants in foreign exchange trading have begun to require their counterparties to post margin.  
 A Fund will typically enter into forward contracts only with major global financial institutions. The creditworthiness of each of the firms that is a party to
a forward contract is monitored by the Sponsor.    The counterparty/credit risk for cleared derivative transactions is generally lower than for uncleared
OTC derivatives since generally a clearing organization becomes substituted for each counterparty to a cleared derivative contract and, in effect, guarantees the parties  performance under the contract as each party to a trade looks only to the
clearing organization for performance of financial obligations. In addition, cleared derivative transactions benefit from daily marking-to-market and settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries.

    Offsetting Assets and Liabilities   
 Each Fund is subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements that allow for amounts owed between each Fund and the counterparty to be netted upon
an early termination. The party that has the larger payable pays the excess of the larger amount over the smaller amount to the other party. The master netting agreements or similar arrangements do not apply to amounts owed to/from different
counterparties. As described above, the Funds utilize derivative instruments to achieve their investment objective during the year. The amounts shown in the Statements of Financial Condition do not take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements or similar arrangements.    For financial reporting purposes, the Funds do not offset derivative assets and derivative
liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements in the Statements of Financial Condition. The following table presents each Fund s derivatives by investment type and by counterparty net of amounts available for offset under a master
netting agreement and the related collateral received or pledged by the Funds as of September 30, 2016:

   NOTE 4   AGREEMENTS   
  Management Fee     Each Leveraged Fund, the Short Euro Fund
and each Geared VIX Fund pays the Sponsor a Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.95% per annum of its average daily NAV of such Fund. Each Matching VIX Fund pays the Sponsor a Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an
amount equal to 0.85% per annum of its average daily NAV of such Fund. The Sponsor did not and will not charge the Management Fee in the first year of operation of each Fund in an amount equal to the offering costs. The Sponsor reimbursed each
Fund, to the extent that its offering costs exceed the Management Fee, for the first year of operations.    The Management Fee is paid in consideration of
the Sponsor s services as commodity pool operator, and for managing the business and affairs of the Funds. From the Management Fee, the Sponsor pays all of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of each Fund,
generally as determined by the Sponsor, including but not limited to the Administrator, Custodian, Distributor, ProFunds Distributors, Inc. ( PDI ), an affiliated broker-dealer of the Sponsor, Transfer Agent, accounting and auditing fees
and expenses, any index licensors for the Funds, and the normal and expected expenses incurred in connection with the continuous offering of Shares of each Fund after the commencement of its trading operations, including, but not limited to,
expenses such as tax preparation expenses, legal fees not in excess of $100,000 per annum, ongoing SEC registration fees not exceeding 0.021% per annum of the NAV of a Fund and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) filing
fees, individual  Schedule K-1  preparation and mailing fees not exceeding 0.10% per annum of the net assets of a Fund, and report preparation and mailing expenses.  
  Non-Recurring Fees and Expenses     Each Fund pays all its
non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses, if any, as determined by the Sponsor. Non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses are fees and expenses which are unexpected or unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or
indemnification or other material expenses which are not currently anticipated obligations of the Funds. Such fees and expenses are those that are non-recurring, unexpected or unusual in nature.  
  The Administrator     The Sponsor and the Trust, for itself
and on behalf of each Fund, has appointed Brown Brothers Harriman   Co. ( BBH Co. ) as the Administrator of the Funds, and the Sponsor, and the Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Fund, and BBH Co. have entered
into an Administrative Agency Agreement (the  Administration Agreement ) in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement and under the supervision and direction of the Sponsor and the Trust, BBH Co.
prepares and files certain regulatory filings on behalf of the Funds. BBH Co. may also perform other services for the Funds pursuant to the Administration Agreement as mutually agreed upon by the Sponsor, the Trust and BBH Co. from time to
time. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, BBH Co. also serves as the Transfer Agent of the Funds. The Administrator s fees are paid on behalf of the Funds by the Sponsor.  
  The Custodian     BBH Co. serves as the Custodian of the
Funds, and the Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Fund, and BBH Co. have entered into a Custodian Agreement in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of the Custodian Agreement, BBH Co. is responsible for the holding and
safekeeping of assets delivered to it by the Funds, and performing various administrative duties in accordance with instructions delivered to BBH Co. by the Funds. The Custodian s fees are paid on behalf of the Funds by the Sponsor.  
      117

   The Distributor   
 SEI Investments Distribution Co. ( SEI ), serves as Distributor of the Funds and assists the Sponsor and the Administrator with certain functions and
duties relating to distribution and marketing, including taking creation and redemption orders, consulting with the marketing staff of the Sponsor and its affiliates with respect to compliance with the requirements of FINRA and/or the NFA in
connection with marketing efforts, and reviewing and filing of marketing materials with FINRA and/or the NFA. SEI retains all marketing materials separately for each Fund, at c/o SEI, One Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA 19456. The Sponsor, on behalf
of each Fund, has entered into a Distribution Services Agreement with SEI. The Sponsor pays SEI for performing its duties on behalf of the Funds.     NOTE
5   OFFERING COSTS     Offering costs will be amortized by the Funds over a twelve month period on a straight-line basis beginning once the fund
commences operations. The Sponsor will not charge its Management Fee in the first year of operations of a Fund in an amount equal to the offering costs. Normal and expected expenses incurred in connection with the continuous offering of Shares of a
Fund after the commencement of its trading operations will be paid by the Sponsor.     NOTE 6   CREATION AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS   
 Each Fund issues and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Units. A Creation Unit is a block of 50,000 Shares of a Geared Fund and
25,000 Shares of a Matching VIX Fund. Creation Units may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. As a result of the Share splits and reverse Share splits as described in Note 1, certain redemptions as disclosed in the Statements of
Changes in Shareholders  Equity reflect payment of fractional share balances on beneficial shareholder accounts.    Except when aggregated in Creation
Units, the Shares are not redeemable securities. Retail investors, therefore, generally will not be able to purchase or redeem Shares directly from or with a Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase or sell Shares in the secondary market
with the assistance of a broker. Thus, some of the information contained in these Notes to Financial Statements such as references to the Transaction Fees imposed on purchases and redemptions is not relevant to retail investors.  
  Transaction Fees on Creation and Redemption Transactions   
 The manner by which Creation Units are purchased or redeemed is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and Authorized Participant
Handbook. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to: (1) deposit cash with the Custodian; and (2) if permitted by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for an exchange of futures contract for
related position or block trade whereby the Authorized Participant would also transfer to such Fund a number and type of exchange-traded futures contracts at or near the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.  
 Authorized Participants may pay a fixed transaction fee of up to $500 in connection with each order to create or redeem a Creation Unit in order to compensate
BBH Co., as the Administrator, the Custodian and the Transfer Agent of each Fund and its Shares, for services in processing the creation and redemption of Creation Units and to offset the costs of increasing or decreasing derivative positions.
Authorized Participants also may pay a variable transaction fee to the Fund of up to 0.10% (and a variable transaction fee to the Matching VIX Funds of 0.05%) of the value of the Creation Unit that is purchased or redeemed unless the transaction fee
is waived or otherwise adjusted by the Sponsor. The Sponsor provides such Authorized Participant with prompt notice in advance of any such waiver or adjustment of the transaction fee. Authorized Participants may sell the Shares included in the
Creation Units they purchase from the Funds to other investors in the secondary market.    Transaction fees for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, which are included in the Addition and/or Redemption of Shares on the Statements of Changes in Shareholders  Equity, were as follows:

   NOTE 8   RISK   
  Correlation and Compounding Risk     The Geared Funds do not
seek to achieve their stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day (as measured from NAV calculation time to NAV calculation time). The return of a Geared Fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its
return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the inverse (-1x), two times the inverse (-2x), or two times (2x) of the return of the Geared Fund s benchmark for the period. A Fund will lose money if its
benchmark performance is flat over time, and it is possible for a Geared Fund to lose money over time even if the performance of its benchmark increases (or decreases in the case of Short and UltraShort Funds), as a result of daily rebalancing, the
benchmark s volatility and compounding. Longer holding periods, higher benchmark volatility, inverse exposure and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on a Fund s returns. Daily compounding of a Geared Fund s
investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as important to a Geared Fund s return for a period as the return of the Fund s underlying
benchmark. The Matching VIX Funds seek to achieve their stated investment objective both over a single day and over time.    Each Ultra and UltraShort Fund
uses leverage and should produce daily returns that are more volatile than that of its benchmark. For example, the daily return of an Ultra Fund with a 2x multiple should be approximately two times as volatile on a daily basis as is the return of a
fund with an objective of matching the same benchmark. The daily return of a Short or UltraShort Fund is designed to return the inverse (-1x) or two times the inverse (-2x) of the return that would be expected of a fund with an objective of matching
the same benchmark. The Geared Funds are not appropriate for all investors and present different risks than other funds. The Leveraged Funds use leverage and are riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that do not use leverage. An
investor should only consider an investment in a Geared Fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged, daily inverse or daily inverse leveraged investment results. Daily objective geared funds, if used properly and in
conjunction with the investor s view on the future direction and volatility of the markets, can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing to monitor and/or
periodically rebalance their portfolios. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.  
 While the Funds expect to meet their investment objectives, several factors may affect their ability to do so. Among these factors are: (1) the
Sponsor s ability to purchase and sell Financial Instruments in a manner that correlates to a Fund s objective; (2) an imperfect correlation between the performance of Financial Instruments held by a Fund and the performance of the
applicable benchmark; (3) bid-ask spreads on such Financial Instruments; (4) fees, expenses, transaction costs, financing costs associated with the use of Financial Instruments and commission costs; (5) holding instruments traded in a
market that has become illiquid or disrupted; (6) a Fund s Share prices being rounded to the nearest cent and/or valuation methodology; (7) changes to a benchmark index that are not disseminated in advance; (8) the need to
conform a Fund s portfolio holdings to comply with investment restrictions or policies or regulatory or tax law requirements; (9) early and unanticipated closings of the markets on which the holdings of a Fund trade, resulting in the
inability of the Fund to execute intended portfolio transactions; (10) accounting standards; and (11) differences caused by a Fund obtaining exposure to only a representative sample of the components of a benchmark, overweighting or
underweighting certain components of a benchmark or obtaining exposure to assets that are not included in a benchmark.    A number of factors may affect a
Geared Fund s ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with its benchmark, and there can be no guarantee that a Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation. Failure to achieve a high degree of correlation may prevent a Geared Fund
from achieving its investment objective. In order to achieve a high degree of correlation with their underlying benchmarks, the Geared Funds seek to rebalance their portfolios daily to keep exposure consistent with their investment objectives. Being
materially under- or over-exposed to the benchmark may prevent such Geared Funds from achieving a high degree of correlation with such benchmark. Market disruptions or closure, large amounts of assets into or out of the Geared Funds, regulatory
restrictions or extreme market volatility will adversely affect such Funds  ability to adjust exposure to requisite levels. The target amount of portfolio exposure is impacted dynamically by the benchmarks  movements during each day.
Because of this, it is unlikely that the Geared Funds will be perfectly exposed ( i.e.,  -1x, -2x or 2x, as applicable) to its benchmark at the end of each day, and the likelihood of being materially under- or over-exposed is higher on days
when the benchmark levels are volatile near the close of the trading day.  
      132  

Table of Contents  

  In addition, unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios as frequently, each Geared Fund may be
subject to increased trading costs associated with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks.  
  Counterparty Risk     Certain of the Funds will use swap
agreements and/or forward contracts as a means to achieve their respective investment objectives. Such Funds will use either swap agreements and/or forward contracts referencing their respective benchmarks. These Funds may also invest in other swap
agreements or forward contracts if such instruments tend to exhibit trading prices or returns that correlate with the benchmark or a component of the benchmark and will further the investment objective of the Fund. Certain Funds may invest in swap
agreements or forward contracts if position accountability rules or position limits are reached with respect to specific futures contracts or the market for a specific futures contract experiences emergencies ( e.g. , natural disaster,
terrorist attack or an act of God) or disruptions ( e.g. , a trading halt or a flash crash) that prevent the Funds from obtaining the appropriate amount of investment exposure to the affected futures contract or certain other futures contracts.
Although unlikely, those Funds, under these circumstances, could have 100% exposure to swap agreements or forward contracts.    Swap agreements and forward
contracts are generally traded in OTC markets and have only recently become subject to regulation by the CFTC. CFTC rules, however, do not cover all types of swap agreements and forward contracts. Investors, therefore, may not receive the protection
of CFTC regulation or the statutory scheme of the Commodity Exchange Act (the  CEA ) in connection with each Fund s swap agreements or forward contracts. The lack of regulation in these markets could expose investors to significant
losses under certain circumstances, including in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants.    The Funds will be subject to credit
risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivatives contracts (whether a clearing corporation in the case of cleared instruments or another third party in the case of OTC uncleared instruments). Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty
to uncleared swap agreements or forward contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, a Fund is subject to credit risk with respect
to the amount it expects to receive from counterparties to uncleared swaps and forward contracts entered into as part of that Fund s principal investment strategy. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations
due to financial difficulties, a Fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts and the value of an investor s investment in a Fund may decline.  
 The Funds have sought to mitigate these risks by generally requiring that the counterparties for each Fund agree to post collateral for the benefit of the
Fund, marked to market daily, subject to certain minimum thresholds; however there are no limitations on the percentage of its assets each Fund may invest in swap agreements or forward contracts with a particular counterparty. To the extent any such
collateral is insufficient or there are delays in accessing the collateral, the Funds will be exposed to counterparty risk as described above, including possible delays in recovering amounts as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. The Funds typically
enter into transactions only with major global financial institutions.    OTC swaps or forward contracts are less liquid than futures contracts because they
are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are generally entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, are not transferable
without the consent of the counterparty. If the level of the Fund s benchmark has a dramatic intraday move that would cause a material decline in the Fund s NAV, the terms of the swap may permit the counterparty to immediately close out
the transaction with the Fund. In that event, it may not be possible for the Fund to enter into another swap agreement or to invest in other Financial Instruments necessary to achieve the desired exposure consistent with the Fund s objective.
This, in turn, may prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective, particularly if the level of the Fund s benchmark reverses all or part of its intraday move by the end of the day. In addition, cleared derivative transactions benefit
from daily marking-to-market and settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries. Transactions entered into directly between two counterparties generally do not benefit from such protections. This exposes
the Funds to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus
causing the Funds to suffer a loss.  
      133  

Table of Contents  

  Each counterparty and/or any of its affiliates may be an Authorized Participant or shareholder of a Fund.  
 The counterparty risk for cleared derivative transactions is generally lower than for uncleared OTC derivatives since generally a clearing organization
becomes substituted for each counterparty to a cleared derivative contract and, in effect, guarantees the parties  performance under the contract as each party to a trade looks only to the clearing house for performance of financial
obligations. However, there can be no assurance that the clearing house, or its members, will satisfy its obligations to the Fund.     Leverage Risk
    The Leveraged Funds may utilize leverage in seeking to achieve their respective investment objectives and will lose more money in market environments
adverse to their respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not employ leverage. The use of leveraged and/or inverse leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an investor s investment.  
 For example, because the UltraShort Funds and Ultra Funds include a two times the inverse (-2x), or a two times (2x) multiplier, a single-day movement in
the relevant benchmark approaching 50% at any point in the day (for an UltraShort Fund or an UltraShort Fund) could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor s investment if that movement is contrary to the investment
objective of the Fund in which an investor has invested, even if such Fund s benchmark subsequently moves in an opposite direction, eliminating all or a portion of the movement. This would be the case with downward single-day or intraday
movements in the underlying benchmark of an Ultra Fund or upward single-day or intraday movements in the benchmark of an UltraShort Fund, even if the underlying benchmark maintains a level greater than zero at all times.  
  Liquidity Risk     Financial Instruments cannot always be
liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption can also make it difficult to liquidate a position or find a swap
or forward contract counterparty at a reasonable cost. Market illiquidity may cause losses for the Funds. The large size of the positions which the Funds may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making their positions more difficult to
liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the Funds will typically invest in Financial Instruments related to one benchmark, which
in many cases is highly concentrated.      Contango  and  Backwardation  Risk   
 In Funds that hold futures contracts, as the futures contracts near expiration, they are generally replaced by contracts that have a later expiration. Thus,
for example, a contract purchased and held in November 2015 may specify a January 2016 expiration. As that contract nears expiration, it may be replaced by selling the January 2016 contract and purchasing the contract expiring in March 2016. This
process is referred to as  rolling.  Rolling may have a positive or negative impact on performance. For example, historically, the prices of certain types of futures contracts have frequently been higher for contracts with shorter-term
expirations than for contracts with longer-term expirations, which is referred to as  backwardation.  In these circumstances, absent other factors, the sale of the January 2016 contract would take place at a price that is higher than the
price at which the March 2016 contract is purchased, thereby creating a gain in connection with rolling. While certain types of futures contracts have historically exhibited consistent periods of backwardation, backwardation will likely not exist in
these markets at all times. The presence of contango (where prices of contracts are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months due to the costs of long-term storage of a physical commodity prior to delivery or other
factors) in certain futures contracts at the time of rolling would be expected to adversely affect an Ultra Fund or a Matching VIX Fund that invests in such futures, and positively affect a Short Fund or an UltraShort Fund that invests in such
futures. Similarly, the presence of backwardation in certain futures contracts at the time of rolling such contracts would be expected to adversely affect the Short Funds and UltraShort Funds, and positively affect the Ultra Funds and Matching VIX
Funds.    Since the introduction of VIX futures contracts, there have frequently been periods where VIX futures prices reflect higher expected volatility
levels further out in time. This can result in a loss from  rolling  the VIX futures to maintain the constant weighted average maturity of the applicable VIX Futures Index. Losses from exchanging a lower priced VIX future for a higher
priced longer-term future in the rolling process would adversely affect the value of each VIX Futures Index and, accordingly, decrease the return of the Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and the Matching VIX Funds.  
      134

  Gold and silver historically exhibit persistent  contango  markets rather than backwardation. Natural
gas, like crude oil, moves in and out of backwardation and contango but historically has been in contango most commonly. It is generally believed this is because the market needs to build inventories for most of the year in order to have enough
storage to make it through a normal winter. Periods of backwardation are typically thought to be caused by demand shocks or supply shortages such as an unusually cold winter or a hurricane.  
  NOTE 9   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS     Management has evaluated

  Introduction     ProShares Trust II (formerly known as the
Commodities and Currencies Trust) (the  Trust ) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on October 9, 2007 and is currently organized into separate series (each, a  Fund  and collectively, the  Funds ). As of
September 30, 2016, the following eighteen series of the Trust have commenced investment operations: (i) ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF (each, a  Matching VIX Fund  and collectively,
the  Matching VIX Funds  (ii) ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (each, a  Geared VIX Fund  and collectively, the  Geared VIX Funds  (iii) ProShares
UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Australian Dollar, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra
Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares Ultra Euro and ProShares Ultra Yen (each, a  Leveraged Fund  and collectively, the  Leveraged Funds  and
(iv) ProShares Short Euro (the  Short Euro Fund ). Each of the Funds listed above issues common units of beneficial interest ( Shares ), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of
only that Fund. The Shares of each Fund are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Archipelago ( NYSE Arca ). The Leveraged Funds, the Short Euro Fund and the Geared VIX Funds, are collectively referred to as the  Geared Funds  in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Geared VIX Funds and the Matching VIX Funds are collectively referred to as the  VIX Funds  in this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q.   
 On February 18, 2016, the Trust announced plans to liquidate ProShares Managed Futures Strategy (ticker symbol: FUTS). ProShares Managed Futures Strategy
was closed to purchases and redemptions as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca on March 18, 2016. Beginning March 21, 2016, no secondary market for ProShares Managed Futures Strategy s Shares remained. Proceeds of the
liquidation were distributed to shareholders on March 30, 2016. Any shareholders remaining in the Fund on March 30, 2016 automatically had their shares redeemed for cash at ProShares Managed Futures Strategy s net asset value per
Share as of March 21, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 removing the listing of ProShares Managed Futures Strategy on the NYSE Arca. On April 11, 2016 a Form 15 was filed with the SEC terminating the registration
of ProShares Managed Futures Strategy.

  On July 25, 2016, the Trust announced plans to liquidate ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity (ticker symbol:
UCD) and ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity (ticker symbol: CMD). ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity and UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity were closed to purchases and redemptions as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca on
August 25, 2016. Beginning August 26, 2016, no secondary market for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity s and ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity s Shares remained. Proceeds of the liquidation were distributed to
shareholders on September 1, 2016. Any shareholders remaining in each liquidating Fund on September 1, 2016 automatically had their shares redeemed for cash at each liquidating Fund s net asset value per Share as of August 26,
2016. On September 2, 2016, the NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 removing the listing of ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity and UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity on the NYSE Arca.  
 The Trust had no operations prior to November 24, 2008, other than matters relating to its organization, the registration of each series under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the sale and issuance to ProShare Capital Management LLC (the  Sponsor ) of ten Shares at an aggregate purchase price of $350 in each of the following Funds: ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil,
ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares Ultra Euro and ProShares Ultra Yen.  
 ProShare Capital Management LLC serves as the Trust s Sponsor (the  Sponsor ) and commodity pool operator. Wilmington Trust Company serves as
the Trustee of the Trust (the  Trustee ). The Funds are commodity pools, as defined under the CEA and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ) and are operated by the Sponsor, a
commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  
 Groups of Funds are collectively referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in several different ways. References to  Short Funds, 
 UltraShort Funds,  or  Ultra Funds  refer to the different Funds based upon their investment objectives, but without distinguishing among the Funds  benchmarks. References to  Commodity Index Funds ,
 Commodity Funds  and  Currency Funds  refer to the different Funds according to their general benchmark categories without distinguishing among the Funds  investment objectives or Fund-specific benchmarks. References to
 VIX Funds  refer to the different Funds based upon their investment objective and their general benchmark categories.    Each of the Funds
generally invests in Financial Instruments ( i.e. , instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, rate or index, including futures contracts, swap agreements, forward contracts and other instruments) as a substitute
for investing directly in commodities, currencies, or spot volatility products in order to gain exposure to its applicable commodity futures index, commodity, currency exchange rate or equity volatility index. Financial Instruments also are used to
produce economically  inverse,   inverse leveraged  or  leveraged  investment results for the Geared Funds.    Each
 Short  Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each  UltraShort  Fund seeks daily investment results (before
fees and expenses) that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each  Ultra  Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times
(2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks investment results (before fees and expenses), both over a single day and over time, that match the performance of its corresponding benchmark. Daily
performance is measured from the calculation of one NAV to the next.    Each Geared Fund seeks investment results for a single day only, not for longer
periods. A  single day  is measured from the time a Fund calculates its respective net asset value per Share ( NAV ) to the time of the Fund s next NAV calculation. This is different from most exchange-traded funds and means
that the return of such Fund for a period longer than a single trading day will be the result of each day s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -1x, -2x or 2x of the return of the index to which such Fund is
benchmarked for that period. In periods of higher market volatility, the volatility of the benchmark may be at least as important to a Geared Fund s return for the period as the return of the benchmark. Geared Funds are riskier than similarly
benchmarked exchange-

traded funds that are not geared. Accordingly, these Funds may not be suitable for all investors and should be used only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of
seeking daily leveraged, inverse or inverse leveraged investment results. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. The Geared VIX Funds do not seek to achieve their stated
objective over a period greater than a single day. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks results (before fees and expenses), both over a single day and over time, that match the performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index (the
 Short-Term VIX Index ) or the S P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index (the  Mid-Term VIX Index ) (each a  VIX Futures Index ). Each Geared VIX Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that
correspond to a multiple or the inverse of the daily performance of the Short-Term VIX Index. Each VIX Fund intends to obtain exposure to its benchmark by investing primarily in futures contracts ( VIX futures contracts ) based on the
Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) Volatility Index (the  VIX ).    ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort
Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas each have a benchmark that is an index designed to track the performance of commodity futures contracts, as applicable. The daily performance of
these indexes and the corresponding Funds will likely be very different from the daily performance of the price of the related physical commodities.    Each
Geared Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 50,000 Shares and each Matching VIX Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 25,000 Shares (each such block a  Creation Unit ). Only Authorized
Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from a Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with one or more of the Funds. Shares of the Funds are offered
to Authorized Participants in Creation Units at each Fund s respective NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share market price that varies depending on,
among other factors, the trading price of the Shares of each Fund on the NYSE Arca, the NAV and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares from the same Creation Unit may be offered at different times and may have
different offering prices based upon the above factors. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a
Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from any Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any underwriting fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     In order to
collateralize derivatives positions in indices, commodities or currencies, a significant portion of the net assets of each Fund is held in cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, or other high credit quality short-term fixed-income
or similar securities (such as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank money market accounts, certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities, whether denominated in U.S. dollars or the
applicable foreign currency with respect to a Currency Fund). A portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements and each Fund s trading in futures and forward contracts. The percentage that U.S.
Treasury bills and other short-term fixed-income securities bear to the shareholders  equity of each Fund varies from period to period as the market values of the underlying swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts change. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 each of the Funds earned interest income as follows:

Each Fund s underlying swaps, futures, forward contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, as applicable, may be
subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, swaps and forward contracts are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and in general are not
transferable without the consent of the counterparty. In the case of futures contracts, commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily limits.  During
a single day, no futures trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in such futures contracts can neither be taken nor
liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent a Fund
from promptly liquidating its futures positions.    Entry into swap agreements or forward contracts may further impact liquidity because these contractual
agreements are executed  off-exchange  between private parties and, therefore, the time required to offset or  unwind  these positions may be greater than that for exchange-traded instruments. This potential delay could be
exacerbated to the extent a counterparty is not a United States person.    The large size of the positions in which a Fund may acquire increases the risk of
illiquidity by both making their positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the Funds will typically
invest in Financial Investments related to one benchmark, which in many cases is highly concentrated.    Because each Fund may enter into swaps and may
trade futures and forward contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk).  
  Market Risk     Trading in derivatives contracts involves
each Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a commodity, currency or spot volatility product underlying the Fund s benchmark at a specified date and price, should it hold such derivatives contract into the deliverable
period. Should a Fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity, currency or spot volatility product, it would be required to make delivery of that commodity, currency or spot volatility product at the contract price and then
repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which the value of a commodity, currency or spot volatility product can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities, currencies
or spot volatility products would expose a Fund to theoretically unlimited risk.    For more information, see  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk  in this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q.      Credit Risk   
 When a Fund enters into swap agreements, futures contracts or forward contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will
not meet its obligations.  
      138  

Table of Contents  

  The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges as well as
certain swaps is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their
members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges, which may become applicable in the future), it may be backed by a consortium
of banks or other financial institutions.    Certain swap and forward agreements are contracted for directly with counterparties. There can be no assurance
that any counterparty, clearing member or clearing house will meet its obligations to a Fund.    Swap agreements do not generally involve the delivery of
underlying assets either at the outset of a transaction or upon settlement. Accordingly, if the counterparty to an uncleared swap agreement defaults, the Fund s risk of loss typically consists of the net amount of payments that the Fund is
contractually entitled to receive, if any. Swap counterparty risk is generally limited to the amount of any unrealized gains, although in the event of a counterparty bankruptcy, there could be delays and costs associated with recovery collateral
posted in segregated tri-party accounts at the Fund s custodian bank.    Forward agreements do not involve the delivery of assets at the onset of a
transaction, but may be settled physically in the underlying asset if such contracts are held to expiration, particularly in the case of currency forwards. Thus, prior to settlement, if the counterparty to a forward contract defaults, a Fund s
risk of loss will generally consist of the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive, if any. However, if physically settled forwards are held until expiration (presently, there is no plan to do this), at the time of
settlement, a Fund may be at risk for the full notional value of the forward contracts depending on the type of settlement procedures used.    The Sponsor
attempts to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally:      

executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor;        

limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties to the Funds;        

not posting margin directly with a counterparty;        

requiring that the counterparty posts collateral in amounts approximately equal to that owed to the Funds, as marked to market daily, subject to certain minimum thresholds;    

limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at a futures commission merchant ( FCM  and        

ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of the underlying asset could be called for.    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   
 As of November 2, 2016, the Funds have not used, nor do they expect to use in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing
arrangements and have no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service
providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Funds. While each Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a
material impact on a Fund s financial position.    Management fee payments made to the Sponsor are calculated as a fixed percentage of each Fund s
NAV. As such, the Sponsor cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs are not known until a future date. The agreement with the Sponsor may be terminated by either party upon 30
days written notice to the other party.

   Critical Accounting Policies   
 The Trust s and the Funds  critical accounting policies are as follows:  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For financial reporting purposes, the Funds value transactions based upon
the final closing price in their primary markets. Accordingly, the investment valuations in these financial statements may differ from those used in the calculation of certain Funds  final creation/redemption NAV ( daily NAV ) for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    Short-term investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value for daily NAV purposes.
For financial reporting purposes, short-term investments are valued at their market price using information provided by a third-party pricing service or market quotations.  
 Derivatives ( e.g. , futures contracts, swap agreements, forward agreements and foreign currency forward contracts) are generally valued using
independent sources and/or agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined by the Sponsor. For daily NAV purposes, futures contracts, except for those entered into by the Gold, Silver, Australian Dollar and Short Euro Funds, are
generally valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades. Futures contracts entered into by the Gold, Silver, Australian Dollar and Short Euro Funds are valued at the last sales price prior to the time at
which the NAV per Share of a Fund is determined. For financial reporting purposes, all futures contracts are valued at last settled price. If there was no sale on that day, and for non-exchange-traded derivatives, the Sponsor may in its sole
discretion choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market value of such position for such day. Such fair value prices would be generally determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying
financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. When market closing prices are not available, the Sponsor may fair
value an asset of a Fund pursuant to the policies the Sponsor has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards.    The use of fair value to
measure Financial Instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Trust s and the Funds  financial statements. The fair value of a Financial Instrument is the amount that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).  
      140  

Table of Contents  

  Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an investment. While the Funds 
policies are intended to result in a calculation of its respective Fund s NAV that fairly reflects investment values as of the time of pricing, such Fund cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Sponsor or persons acting at their
direction would accurately reflect the price a Fund could obtain for an investment if it were to dispose of that investment as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). The prices used by such Fund may differ from the
value that would be realized if the investments were sold and the differences could be material to the financial statements.

   Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2015      ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF*   
  Fund Performance     The following table provides summary
performance information for the Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the increase in the Fund s NAV resulted from an increase from
4,229,962 outstanding Shares at June 30, 2016 to 7,984,451 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2016. The increase in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results (before fees and
expenses) that correspond to the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. By comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the decrease in the Fund s NAV resulted from a decrease from 2,509,962
outstanding Shares at June 30, 2015 to 1,284,962 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2015. The decrease in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that
correspond to the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s
daily performance had a statistical correlation over 0.99 of the daily performance of its benchmark. The Fund s per Share NAV decrease of 36.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV
increase of 27.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a depreciation in the value of the assets of the Fund during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s per Share NAV reached its high for the period on July 5, 2016 at $44.95 per Share
and reached its low for the period on September 28, 2016 at $27.72 per Share. By comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Fund s per Share NAV reached its high for the period on September 1, 2015 at
$101.25 per Share and reached its low for the period on August 10, 2015 at $51.75 per Share.    The benchmark s decline of 36.8% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the benchmark s rise of 27.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, can be attributed to a decline in the prices of the near-term futures contracts on the VIX futures curve
during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

    The following table provides summary performance information for the Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  
   
   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the increase in the Fund s NAV resulted from an increase from
812,403 outstanding Shares at June 30, 2016 to 1,287,403 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2016. The increase in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results (before fees and
expenses) that correspond to the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index. By comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the increase in the Fund s NAV resulted from the cumulative effect of the
Fund seeking daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index. There was no net change in the Fund s outstanding Shares from June 30, 2015 to
September 30, 2015.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s daily performance had a statistical correlation over 0.99 of
the daily performance of its benchmark. The Fund s per Share NAV decrease of 12.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV increase of 16.2% for the three months ended September 30,
2015, was primarily due to a depreciation in the value of the assets of the Fund during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Performance     The following table provides summary performance information for the Fund for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:
     
   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the decrease in the Fund s NAV resulted primarily from a decrease
from 13,800,000 outstanding Shares at June 30, 2016 to 6,950,000 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2016. The decrease in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results (before fees
and expenses) that correspond to the inverse of the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. By comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the increase in the Fund s NAV resulted from an
increase from 2,400,040 outstanding Shares at June 30, 2015 to 13,350,040 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2015. The increase in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results

  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s daily performance had a statistical
correlation over 0.99 of the inverse of the daily performance of its benchmark. The Fund s per Share NAV increase of 45.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV decrease of 40.2% for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to an appreciation in the value of the assets of the Fund during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s per Share NAV reached its high for the period on September 7, 2016 at $79.16 per

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increase in the Fund s NAV resulted from an
increase from 2,699,294 outstanding Shares at December 31, 2015 to 4,349,290 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2016. The increase in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results
(before fees and expenses) that correspond to 2x of the inverse of the daily performance of the spot price of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. By comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the decrease in the
Fund s NAV resulted primarily from a decrease from 5,949,294 outstanding Shares at December 31, 2014 to 3,449,294 outstanding Shares at September 30, 2015. The decrease in the Fund s NAV also resulted in part from the cumulative
effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to 2x of the inverse of the daily performance of the spot price of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s daily performance had a statistical correlation over 0.99 to 2x of the inverse of the daily

primarily due to a greater depreciation in the value of the assets of the Fund during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund s per Share NAV reached its high for the period on January 29, 2016 at $88.99 per Share and reached its low for the period on August 18, 2016 at $59.02 per Share. By comparison, during

 The benchmark s rise of 18.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the benchmark s decline of 0.2% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, can be attributed to a rise in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

to any such subsequent increases (decreases) in notional values, before accounting for spreads or transaction or financing costs. The Fund will generally attempt to adjust its positions in Financial Instruments  each day  to match the
performance of the Index. While the above information properly represents the then current equity price risk and is adequate for estimating the following day s gains or losses, estimates of future values over longer periods should take the

 As described above in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, it is the investment objective of each Geared Fund to seek daily investment results,
before fees and expenses, which correspond to a multiple, the inverse or an inverse multiple of the daily performance, whether positive or negative, of its corresponding benchmark. Each Short Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and
expenses) that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each UltraShort Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily
performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Ultra Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks
investment results (before fees and expenses), both over a single day and over time, that match the performance of a benchmark. The Geared Funds do not seek to achieve these stated investment objectives over a period of time greater than a single
day because mathematical compounding prevents the Geared Funds from achieving such results. Performance over longer periods of time will be influenced not only by the cumulative period performance of the corresponding benchmark but equally by the
intervening volatility of the benchmark as well as fees and expenses, including costs associated with the use of Financial Instruments such as financing costs and trading spreads. Future  period  returns, before fees and expenses, cannot be
estimated simply by estimating the percent change in the corresponding benchmark and multiplying by two or negative two. Each Matching VIX Fund seek investment results (before fees and expenses), both over a single day and over time, that match the
performance of a benchmark. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Form 10-K for additional information regarding performance
for periods longer than a single day. The Matching VIX Funds seek to achieve their stated objectives both over a single day and over time.     Primary
Market Risk Exposure     The primary market risks that the Funds are exposed to depend on each Fund s investment objective and corresponding
benchmark. For example, the primary market risk that the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil and the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil Funds are exposed to are inverse and direct exposure, respectively, to the price of crude oil as measured
by the return of holding and periodically rolling crude oil futures contracts (the Bloomberg Commodity Index and its sub-indexes are based on the price of rolling futures positions, rather than on the cash price for immediate delivery of the
corresponding commodity).    Each Fund s exposure to market risk is further influenced by a number of factors, including the liquidity of the markets
in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of each Fund s trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially
all of investors  capital.    As described above in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, trading in certain futures contracts or forward
agreements involves each Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a commodity underlying a Fund s benchmark at a specified date and price, should it hold such futures contracts or forward agreements into the deliverable
period. Should a Fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity, it is required to make delivery of that commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the
repurchase price to which the value of a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities would expose a Fund to theoretically unlimited risk.  
  Commodity Price Sensitivity     As further described in
 Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Form 10-K, the value of the Shares of each Fund relates directly to the value of, and realized profit or loss from, the Financial Instruments and other assets held by the Fund and fluctuations in the price of
these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. With regard to the Commodity Index Funds or the Commodity Funds, several factors may affect the price of a commodity underlying a Commodity Index Fund or a Commodity Fund,
and in turn, the Financial Instruments and other assets, if any, owned by such a Fund. The impact of changes in the price of a physical commodity or of a commodity index (comprised of commodity futures contracts) will affect investors differently
depending upon the Fund in which investors invest. Daily increases in the price of an underlying commodity or commodity index will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of an UltraShort Fund and daily decreases in the price of an
underlying commodity or commodity index will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of an Ultra Fund.  
      204

  Additionally, performance over time is a cumulative effect of geometrically linking each day s leveraged or
inverse leveraged returns. For instance, if a corresponding benchmark was up 10% and then down 10%, which would result in a (1.1*0.9)-1 = -1% period benchmark return, the two-day period return for a theoretical two-times fund would be equal to a
(1.2 *0.8)-1 = -4% period Fund return (rather than simply two times the period return of the benchmark).     Exchange Rate Sensitivity   
 As further described in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Form 10-K, the value of the Shares of each Fund relates directly to the value of, and realized
profit or loss from, the Financial Instruments and other assets held by the Fund and fluctuations in the price of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. With regard to the Currency Funds, several factors may
affect the value of the foreign currencies or the U.S. dollar, and, in turn, the Financial Instruments and other assets, if any, owned by a Fund. The impact of changes in the price of a currency will affect investors differently depending upon the
Fund in which investors invest. Daily increases in the price of a currency will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of a Short Fund or an UltraShort Fund and daily decreases in the price of a currency will negatively impact the daily
performance of Shares of an Ultra Fund.    Additionally, performance over time is a cumulative effect of geometrically linking each day s leveraged or
inverse leveraged returns. For instance, if a corresponding benchmark was up 10% and then down 10%, which would result in a (1.1*0.9)-1 = -1% period benchmark return, the two-day period return for a theoretical two-times fund would be equal to a
(1.2 *0.8)-1 = -4% period Fund return (rather than simply two times the period return of the benchmark).     Equity Market Volatility Sensitivity   
 As further described in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Form 10-K, the value of the Shares of each VIX Fund relates directly to the value of, and
realized profit or loss from, the Financial Instruments and other assets held by the Fund and fluctuations in the price of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Several factors may affect the price and/or
liquidity of VIX futures contracts and other assets, if any, owned by a VIX Fund. The impact of changes in the price of these assets will affect investors differently depending upon the Fund in which investors invest.  
  Managing Market Risks     Each Fund seeks to remain fully
exposed to the corresponding benchmark at the levels implied by the relevant investment objective (-1x, -2x, or 2x), regardless of market direction or sentiment. At the close of the relevant markets each trading day (see NAV calculation times), each
Fund will seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to its benchmark is consistent with its investment objective. As described above in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, these adjustments are done through the use of
various Financial Instruments. No attempt is made to adjust market exposure in order to avoid changes to the benchmark that would cause the Funds to lose value. Factors common to all Funds that may require portfolio re-positioning are create/redeem
activity and index rebalances.    For Geared Funds, the impact of the Index s movements during the day also affects whether the Fund s portfolio
needs to be re-positioned. For example, if the index for an Ultra Fund has risen on a given day, net assets of the Fund should rise. As a result, the Fund s long exposure will need to be increased to the extent there are not offsetting factors
such as redemption activity. Conversely, if the index has fallen on a given day, net assets of an Ultra Fund should fall. As a result, the Fund s long exposure will generally need to be decreased. Net assets for Short Funds or UltraShort Funds
will generally decrease when the index rises on a given day. As a result, the Fund s short exposure may need to be decreased. Conversely, if the index has fallen on a given day, a Short Fund s or an UltraShort Fund s assets should
rise. As a result, the Fund s short exposure may need to be increased.    The use of certain Financial Instruments introduces counterparty risk. A Fund
will be subject to credit risk with respect to the amount it expects to receive from counterparties to Financial Instruments entered into by the Fund. A Fund may be negatively impacted if a counterparty fails to perform its obligations. Each Fund
intends to enter into swap and forward agreements only with major global financial institutions that meet certain credit quality standards and monitoring policies. Each Fund may use various techniques to minimize credit risk including early
termination or reset and payment, limiting the net amount due from any individual counterparty, and generally requiring that the counterparty post collateral with respect to amounts owed to the Funds, marked to market daily.  
      205

  Most Financial Instruments held by the Funds are  unfunded  meaning that the Fund will obtain exposure
to the corresponding benchmark while still being in possession of its original cash assets. The cash positions that result from use of such Financial Instruments are held in a manner to minimize both interest rate and credit risk. During the
reporting period, cash positions were maintained in a non-interest bearing demand deposit account. The Funds also invest a portion of this cash in cash equivalents (such as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank money market accounts,
certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities).

  Controls and Procedures.        Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust, Trust management has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s and the Funds  disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust and the Funds (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  1934 Act )) were effective, as of September 30, 2016, including providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits
under the 1934 Act on behalf of the Trust and the Funds is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the duly
authorized officers of the Trust as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting     There were no changes in the Trust s or the Funds  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or the Funds  internal control over financial reporting.  
  Certifications     The certifications by the Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Trust required by Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which are filed or furnished as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, apply both to the
Trust taken as a whole and each Fund, and the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Trust are certifying both as to the Trust taken as a whole and each Fund

  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.         

(a) 
 None.      (b) The Trust initially registered Shares on its Registration Statement on Form S-1
(File No. 333-146801), which was declared effective on November 21, 2008, and registered additional Shares on its Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-156888), which was declared effective on February 13, 2009. The
Trust terminated these two offerings before the sale of all registered Shares and re-allocated the remaining amount of the registered Shares among the Funds listed on its Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-163511), which became
effective on December 4, 2009. It then registered additional Shares and/or added Funds pursuant to post-effective amendments to that Registration Statement on Form S-3, which became effective on May 28, 2010, November 5,
2010, December 23, 2010 and April 13, 2011, as well as on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-178707), which became effective on June 25, 2012. On June 26, 2012, a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-163511) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil and terminated the offerings for certain publicly offered Funds and certain Funds that
had never been publicly offered. New offerings for those Funds that had been publicly offered were registered on an accompanying Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-176878), which was also declared effective on June 26, 2012.
On September 24, 2012, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-183672) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares

Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-183674) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil and ProShares UltraShort Euro. This registration statement
was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-3 (File No. 333-163511). On September 28, 2012, a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-178707) was declared
effective, terminating the proposed offerings of several unlaunched currency funds. On January 30, 2013, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-185288) was declared effective. That registration statement, which registered
additional Shares to ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, acted as a combined prospectus and post-effective amendment to the Trust s Form S-1 Registration Statements (File Nos. 333-183672 and 333-178707).  
 Also, on January 30, 2013, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-185289) was declared effective. That registration
statement, which registered additional Shares to ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, acted as a combined prospectus and post-effective
amendment to the Trust s Form S-1 Registration Statement (File No. 333-193672) and Form S-3 Registration Statement (File No. 333-183674). On April 24, 2013, a post-effective amendment to the

registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF. That registration statement was a combined
prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-1 (File No. 333-185288). On July 30, 2013, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-189967) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for
ProShares Bloomberg Crude Oil and ProShares UltraShort Yen and partially terminated registered and unissued Shares of ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro and ProShares
VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. That registration statement was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-3 (File No. 333-187820). On May 6, 2014, a post-effective amendment to the Form S-1 Registration
Statement (File No. 333-188215) was declared effective, updating the Form S-1 Registration Statement by, among other things, incorporating by reference the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The
post-effective amendment did not register any additional shares. On July 30, 2014, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-196884) was declared effective, which partially terminated registered and unissued Shares of ProShares
VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity, ProShares Ultra Euro, ProShares Ultra Yen and ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity. That registration statement was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to
two Form S-1 registration statements (File Nos. 333-188215 and 333-185288). On July 30, 2014, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-196885) was also declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra
Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil and ProShares UltraShort Euro and partially terminated registered and unissued Shares of ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver and ProShares UltraShort Silver. That Registration
Statement also was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-3 (File No. 333-189967). Through the July 30, 2014 filings, ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF was transferred from the Form S-1 to the
Form S-3. On September 29, 2014, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-198189) was declared effective, which registered a new offering of the Managed Futures Fund and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-1
Registration Statement (File No. 333-196884). On November 25, 2014, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-199642) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas,
ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas and ProShares UltraShort Silver. That registration statement was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-1 registration statement (File No. 333-198189) and the Form
S-3 registration statement (333-196885). On November 25, 2014, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-199641) was also declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares
Ultra Gold, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. That
Registration Statement also was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-3 (File No. 333-196885). Through the November 25, 2014 filings, ProShares UltraShort Silver was transferred from the Form S-3 to
the Form S-1. On March 31, 2015, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-202724) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF, ProShares Managed Futures Strategy, ProShares
Ultra Bloomberg Commodity, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar, ProShares UltraShort Australian Dollar, ProShares Ultra Euro, ProShares

Form S-3 (File No. 333- 
      209  

Table of Contents  

202725) was also declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares
UltraShort Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. That Registration
Statement also was a combined prospectus and acted as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-3 (File No. 333-199641). On August 11, 2015, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-202724) was declared effective which
removed ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar from the Form S-1; no additional shares were registered with that filing. That registration statement was a combined prospectus and acted as a pre-effective amendment to post-effective amendment No. 1
of the Form S-1. On March 30, 2016, Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-202725) was declared effective, which removed from registration all of the Shares that remained unsold
thereunder as of the close of business on March 30, 2016. On March 30, 2016, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-210024) was declared effective, which registered additional Shares for ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude
Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF, ProShares Short VIX Short-Term
Futures ETF, ProShares VIX Short Term Futures ETF. Thus, as of September 30, 2016, the Trust had two effective registration statements outstanding: 1) a Form S-1 Registration Statement (No. 333-202724); and 2) a Form S-3 Registration Statement
(No. 333-210024).    Substantially all of the proceeds received by each Fund from the issuance and sale of Shares to Authorized Participants are used by
each Fund to enter into Financial Instruments relating to that Fund s benchmark in combination with cash or cash equivalents and/or U.S. Treasury securities or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities (such as
shares of money market funds and collateralized repurchase agreements) that may in part be used for direct investment or deposited with the FCMs as margin in connection with futures contracts or in segregated accounts at the Funds  custodian
bank as collateral for swap agreements or forward contracts, as applicable. Each Geared Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 50,000 Shares, and each Matching VIX Fund continuously offers and redeems Shares in blocks of 25,000
Shares.
