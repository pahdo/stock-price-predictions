Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)   (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)    1. Nature of Business and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    Arvana Inc. ( our ,  we , us  and the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of   Nevada as Turinco, Inc. on September 16, 1977. On July 24, 2006, the shareholders approved a change of   the Company s name from Turinco, Inc. to Arvana Inc.   These condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016,   include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary Arvana Networks Inc. (including its wholly-   owned subsidiaries, Arvana Participa  es S.A. and Arvana Comunica  es do Brasil S. A. The Company   has ceased all operations in its subsidiary companies, and has written-off or disposed of all assets in the   subsidiary companies, consequently they are now all considered to be inactive subsidiaries.   Our reporting currency and functional currency is the United States dollar ( US Dollar ) and the   accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US Dollars.   These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which   assumes the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine   month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a net loss of $115,602 as a result of   general administrative expenses and foreign exchange losses. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a   working capital deficiency of $2,364,679. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s   ability to continue as a going concern.   Accordingly, the Company will require continued financial support from its shareholders and creditors   until it is able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations on a sustained basis. There is substantial   doubt that the Company will be successful at achieving these results. Failure to obtain the ongoing   support of its shareholders and creditors may make the going concern basis of accounting inappropriate,   in which case the Company s assets and liabilities would need to be recognized at their liquidation values.   These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification   of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might arise from this uncertainty.   7          Arvana Inc.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)   (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)    2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     Basis of presentation    The Company is in the process of transacting a business opportunity and has minimal operating levels.   The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. The accompanying condensed interim consolidated   financial statements of Arvana Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been   prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP )   for financial information with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Results are not   necessarily indicative of results which may be achieved in the future. Although they are unaudited, in the   opinion of management, they include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items,   necessary for a fair presentation. Results are not necessarily indicative of results which may be achieved   in the future. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements and notes appearing in this report   should be read in conjunction with our consolidated audited financial statements and related notes thereto,   together with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,   contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with   the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 14, 2016.    Use of Estimates    The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management   to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure   of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of   revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These   estimates include the recognition of deferred tax assets based on the change in unrecognized deductible   temporary tax differences.    Financial instruments    The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of each class of   financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate such values:   Cash - the carrying amount approximates fair value because the amounts consist of cash held at a bank.   Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and loans payable - the carrying amount approximates fair value   due to the short-term nature of the obligations.   8          Arvana Inc.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)   (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)    2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)     Financial instruments (continued)    The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December   31, 2015 follows:      September 30,     December 31,       2016     2015       Carrying     Fair     Carrying     Fair       Amount     Value     Amount     Value      Cash   $10,456   $10,456   $53   $53     Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   1,069,084   1,069,084   1,018,963   1,018,963     Convertible loan   50,000   50,000   -   -     Loans payable to stockholders   631,084   631,084   619,671   619,671     Loans payable to related party   30,042   30,042   28,941   28,941     Loans payable   147,624   147,624   147,225   147,225     Amounts due to related parties   447,301   447,301   434,330   434,330   The following table presents information about the assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring   basis as of September 30, 2016, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the   Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize   quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs   utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values   determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and included   situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset:      Quoted     Significant       Prices     Other     Significant       September     in Active     Observable     Unobservable       30,     Markets     Inputs     Inputs       2016     (Level 1)     (Level 2)     (Level 3)    Assets:     Cash   $   10,456   $   10,456   $       $       The fair value of cash is determined through market, observable and corroborated sources.   9          Arvana Inc.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)   (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)    2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)     Recent accounting pronouncements    In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards   Update 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The standard requires the recognition of lease assets and lease   liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Leases will be classified as either   finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. The standard   requires lessors to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating. A sales-type lease occurs if the   lessor transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If   risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as a financing lease. If   the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. The standard will   become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the   impact adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition,   cash flows, and financial statement disclosures.   In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Updates   (ASU) 2014-15 requiring an entity s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,   considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about entity s ability to continue as a going concern   within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that   the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The amendments to (ASU) 2014-15   are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim   periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the   prospective impact that (ASU) 2014-15 will have on its consolidated balance sheet.   10          Arvana Inc.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)   (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)    3. Amounts Due to Related Parties and Loans Payable to Stockholders    From February, 2007, until September 30, 2016, the Company received a number of loans from   stockholders, related parties and unrelated third parties.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had   received loans of $631,084 (Euro 225,000; CAD$ 72,300; $323,107) (December 31, 2015 - $619,671:   Euro 225,000; CAD$ 72,300; $323,107) from stockholders, loans of $30,042 (CAD$ 27,600; $9,000)   (December 31, 2015   $28,941: CAD$ 27,600; $9,000) from a related party and loans of $147,624   (CAD$ 10,000; $140,000) (December 31, 2015   $147,225: CAD$10,000; $140,000) from unrelated   third parties. All of the loans bear interest at 6% per annum.  The loans were made in 3 different   currencies, Euros, Canadian Dollars and US Dollars.  All amounts reflected on these consolidated   financial statements are expressed in US Dollars.  Repayment of the loans is due on closing of any future   financing arrangement by the Company. The balance of accrued interest of $372,900 and $330,536 is   included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015,   respectively.  Interest expense recognized on these loans was $12,132 and $36,409 for the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $12,084 and $36,151 for the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company also received a convertible loan of   $50,000 from CaiE Food Partnership Ltd. as per Note 7 below.   At September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had amounts due to related parties of   $447,301 and $434,330, respectively.  This amount includes $136,100 at September 30, 2016, and   December 31, 2015, payable to two former directors and a current director for services rendered during   2007. This amount is to be paid part in cash and part in stock at a future date with the number of common   shares determined by the fair value of the shares on the settlement date. The amounts owing bear no   interest, are unsecured, and have no fixed terms of repayment.    4. Common stock    We have a stock option plan in place under which we are authorized to grant options to executive officers   and directors, employees and consultants enabling them to acquire up to 10% of our issued and   outstanding common stock. Under the plan, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of   our stock as calculated on the date of grant. The options can be granted for a maximum term of 10 years.   Vesting terms are determined at the time of grant.   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no stock options outstanding.  No options   were granted, exercised or expired during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 or the year   ended December 31, 2015.    5.

Memorandum of Understanding    On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU )   with CaiE Food Partnership Ltd. ( CaiE ) for the purpose of acquiring CaiE as a wholly owned   subsidiary. The MOU anticipates that the Company will issue, subject to shareholder approval, a fully   diluted 67% interest in its common stock in exchange for CaiE. The MOU also provides that the   Company enter into debt settlement agreements with certain of its existing creditors (see Note 8),   whereby the Company will issue shares of its common stock in order to settle certain historical debt. It is   anticipated that the shares will be issued at a deemed value of $0.50 per share pursuant to the debt   settlement agreements. Concurrently, the Company will increase the number of its authorized common   shares, elect a new Board of Directors and change its name to reflect the new business.   The MOU further provides that CaiE lend the Company $50,000 on a convertible basis prior to the   consummation of the transaction. The terms and conditions of the conversion of this loan have not been   agreed, though the intention of each party is that the conversion be effected at the same price as that of   Debt Settlement Agreements discussed above. CaiE has loaned the Company $50,000 as of the filing date   of this report, which has been accounted for as a liability as at September 30, 2016, but will be reassessed   for a beneficial conversion feature once the terms of the loan have been finalized.    8. Subsequent Events    On October 25, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release dated effective   September 30, 2016, in connection with satisfying a debt in the amount of $74,450, comprised of a loan   and accrued interest, in exchange for 148,900 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the   exemptions from registration provided under Section 4(2) and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933,   as amended ( Securities Act ). No commissions or fees were paid in connection with this offering.   13               Item 2.      Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations.    This  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and other   parts of this quarterly report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.   Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as  anticipates,   expects,   believes,     plans,   predicts,  and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future   performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-   looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to those   discussed in the subsection entitled  Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future     Results and Financial Condition  below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our   financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Our fiscal year end is December 31. All   information presented herein is based on the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2015.    Overview    On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU )   with CaiE Food Partnership Ltd. ( CaiE ) for the purpose of acquiring CaiE as a wholly owned   subsidiary. CaiE is in the business of manufacturing and distributing fresh Dim Sum food products from a   facility based in Sparks Nevada. The MOU anticipates that the Company will issue, subject to shareholder   approval, a fully diluted sixty-seven percent (67%) interest in its common stock in exchange for CaiE.   The MOU further provides that CaiE lend the Company fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) on a convertible   basis prior to the consummation of the transaction. The anticipated transaction will require the Company   to convert existing debt into shares of its common stock, increase the number of authorized common   shares, elect a new Board of Directors and change its name to reflect the new business. CaiE had loaned   the Company $50,000 as of the filing date of this report and the Company is working with CaiE to   finalize a definitive transaction.   In the event that the Company does not complete the acquisition of CaiE, its intention will be to identify   and evaluate alternative business opportunities that might be a good match for the Company. We will not   be able to develop any identified business opportunities without additional financing. Our board of   directors and management are actively pursuing financing in order to maintain operations but are not   currently evaluating potential businesses pending the anticipated transaction with CaiE.    Our Plan of Operation    The Company s plan of operation over the next twelve months is to acquire CaiE as a wholly owned   subsidiary on those terms to be provided within definitive agreements based on the MOU and thereafter to   focus on CaiE s business model. We will require a minimum of $50,000 in funding over the next 12   months to maintain operations and acquire CaiE. On completing the acquisition of CaiE the Company   may need additional capital to grow CaiE s business. The amount of funding that may be required for this   purpose is not determinable at this time.   Should the Company not complete the anticipated transaction with CaiE then it will seek to identify an   alternative business opportunity for which purpose it will require a minimum of $25,000 in funding over   the next 12 months. The Company will most likely need additional funding to complete any alternative   transaction that might be identified within this time frame.   14        
    We anticipate that the required prospective funding in the near term will be in the form of convertible   debt financing from CaiE. Should the Company not complete the anticipated transaction with CaiE, then   requisite funding may come from the sale of our common shares or unsecured shareholder loans. The   Company does not have any alternative financing arranged and cannot be certain that it will be able to   realize funding from the sale of equity or that shareholders will continue to provide loans. Accordingly,   we will require continued financial support from our shareholders and creditors until the Company is able   to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain operations on a sustained basis. There is substantial doubt that   the Company will be successful in maintaining operations unless it completes the acquisition of CaiE.    Results of Operations    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company (i) entered into a non-binding MOU   with CaiE; and (ii) satisfied continuous public disclosure requirements.   Our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below.     Three months   Three months   Nine months   Nine months     Ended   Ended   Ended   Ended     September 30,   September 30,   September 30,   September 30,     2016   2015   2016   2015   Expenses:     General and administration   ($3,976)   ($2,926)   ($12,510)   ($9,302)     Professional fees   (3,380)   (5,066)   (12,257)   (13,052)     Interest   (12,132)   (12,084)   (36,409)   (36,151)     Foreign exchange gain (loss)   278   47,581   (54,426)   144,616   Net income (loss) and   comprehensive income (loss) for     the period   ($19,210)   $27,505   ($115,602)   $86,111     Net Income (Losses)     Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $19,210 as compared to net income of   $27,505 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The recognition of a net loss over the three   month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015,   can be attributed to a decrease in foreign exchange gain, relative consistency in general and administrative   expenses, professional fees, and interest expense over the comparable three month periods.   Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $115,602 as compared to net income of   $86,111 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The transition to net losses over the nine month   period ended September 30, 2016, can be primarily attributed to the loss on foreign exchange in the   current nine month period as compared to a foreign exchange gain in the comparable nine month period.   The loss on foreign exchange in the current nine month period is due to an increase in the value of foreign   currencies against the US dollar, which increase has negatively impacted the cost of those expenses that   are payable in foreign currencies.   We did not generate revenue during this period and expect to continue to incur losses over the next twelve   months at a rate comparable to the prior annual period presented here or until such time as we are able to   conclude the acquisition or development of a new business opportunity that produces net income.   15        
      Capital Expenditures     The Company expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the nine month period ended September   30, 2016.     Income Tax Expense (Benefit)     The Company has a prospective income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carry-forward and   start up costs that will offset any future operating profit.     Impact of Inflation     The Company believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past three years.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Since inception, the Company has experienced significant changes in liquidity, capital resources, and   stockholders  deficiency.   The Company had current and total assets of $10,456 as of September 30, 2016, consisting solely of cash   and a working capital deficit of $2,364,679, as compared to current and total assets of $53, consisting   solely of cash and a working capital deficit of $2,249,077 as of December 31, 2015. Net stockholders'   deficiency in the Company was $2,364,679 at September 30, 2016, as compared to a net stockholder s   deficiency in the Company of $2,249,077 at December 31, 2015.     Cash Used in Operating Activities     Net cash flow used in operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was   $39,597 as compared to $9,711 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, which differences   reflect the comparative changes in unrealized foreign exchange and changes in working capital in the   current period. Net cash flow used in operating activities in the prior period can also be primarily   attributed to general and administrative expenses, and changes in working capital.  General and   administrative expenses include but are not limited to, personnel costs, accounting fees and consulting   expenses while changes in working capital include accounts payable and amounts due to related parties.   We expect to continue to use net cash flow in operating activities over the next twelve months or until   such time as the Company can generate revenue to offset expenses in order to transition to providing net   cash flow from operations.     Cash Used in Investing Activities     We do expect to use net cash flow in investing activities in connection with the prospective acquisition of   CaiE. However, until such time as such transaction is concluded, we do not expect to use net cash flows   in investing activities.     Cash Flows from Financing Activities     Cash flow provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased to   $50,000 as compared to $10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cash   flow provided from financing activities over the comparative nine month periods can be attributed to a   convertible loan received from CaiE.   16          We expect to continue to use cash flow provided by financing activities to procure sufficient funds to   maintain operations, acquire CaiE and alternatively, in the event that our shareholders do not approve the   acquisition of CaiE, to seek out suitable business opportunities.   The Company s current assets are insufficient to conduct its plan of operation over the next twelve (12)   months as we will need at least $50,000 to maintain operations. The Company has secured a non-binding   commitment from CaiE in the form of a convertible loan of $50,000 to maintain operations and undertake   the acquisition detailed in the MOU. The Company has no alternative commitments or arrangements with   respect to, or immediate sources of funding. The Company s shareholders remain the most likely source   of new funding in the form of loans or equity placements though none have made any commitment for   future investment and the Company has no agreement formal or otherwise. The Company s inability to   obtain sufficient funding to maintain operations will have a material adverse affect on its ability to fulfill   its plan of operation.   The Company does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   The Company had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016.   The Company had no commitments for future capital expenditures that were material at September 30,   2016.   The Company has no defined benefit plan or contractual commitment with any of its officers or directors.   The Company has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment.   The Company has no current plans to make any changes in the number of employees.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     As of September 30, 2016, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are   reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial   condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources   that are material to stockholders.     Future Financings     We anticipate continuing to rely on debt or equity sales of our shares of common stock in order to   continue to fund our business operations. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales   of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.     Critical Accounting Policies     In Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and   2014, included in our Form 10-K, the Company discusses those accounting policies that are considered to   be significant in determining the results of operations and its financial position.  The Company believes   that the accounting principles utilized by it conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the   United States.   17          The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Company management to make significant   estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. By   their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an on-going basis, the   Company evaluates estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other facts   and circumstances that are believed to be reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments   about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.  The actual results may differ from these estimates under   different assumptions or conditions.     Going Concern     Management of the Company has expressed an opinion as to the Company s ability to continue as a going   concern as a result of an accumulated deficit of $ 23,528,847 since inception and      negative cash flows    from    operating activities     as of September 30, 2016.  The Company s ability to continue as a going    concern is subject to the ability of the Company to obtain funding from outside sources.  Management s   plan to address the Company s ability to continue as a going concern includes obtaining funding from the   private placement of equity or through debt financing.  Management believes that it will be able to obtain   funding to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, though   there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.     Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition     The statements contained in the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this current report, with the exception of historical   facts, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and   beliefs regarding our future results of operations, performance, and achievements. These statements are   subject to risks and uncertainties and are based upon assumptions and beliefs that may or may not   materialize. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning:          our anticipated financial performance and business plan;           the sufficiency of existing capital resources;           our ability to raise capital to fund cash requirements for future operations;           uncertainties related to the Company s future business prospects;           the volatility of the stock market and;           general economic conditions.    We wish to caution readers that our operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that   could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed or anticipated. We also wish to   advise readers not to place any undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this report,   which reflect our beliefs and expectations only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to   update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances or any changes   in our beliefs or expectations, other than as required by law.     Stock-Based Compensation     We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC ) 718, Share-Based Payment, which   addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee   services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair   value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity   instruments.   18          We account for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than   employees in accordance with ASC 505. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the   consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more   reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee   services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the   provider of goods or services.      Item 3.      Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Not required for smaller reporting companies.      Item 4.      Controls  and Procedures      Disclosure Controls and Procedures     In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the   Company s management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and the acting chief   financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in   Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required   to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,   and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such   information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and   the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by   this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective in recording,   processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods   specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and such information was not accumulated and   communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to   allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of   the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are   reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.   19           PART II       Item 1.      Legal  Proceedings.    None.      Item 1A.      Risk  Factors    Not required.      Item 2.      Unregistered  Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    None.      Item 3.      Defaults  Upon Senior Securities    None.      Item 4.      Mine  Safety Disclosures    Not applicable.      Item 5.      Other  Information    None.      Item 6.
