1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (together, the "Company" or "Qorvo") have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which could differ materially from actual results.  In addition, certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed, or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments (which are of a normal and recurring nature) necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Qorvo s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 2, 2016  . 
    
  On February 22, 2014, RF Micro Devices, Inc. ( RFMD ) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization as subsequently amended on July 15, 2014 (the "Merger Agreement"), with TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. ("TriQuint") providing for the combination of RFMD and TriQuint in a merger of equals (the "Business Combination") under a new holding company named Qorvo, Inc.  The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were consummated on January 1, 2015. 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year.  The first fiscal quarter of each year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30, the second fiscal quarter of each year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and the third fiscal quarter of each year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31.  Fiscal 2017 is a 52-week year and the three and six months ended October 1, 2016 included 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. Comparatively, fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year and the three and six months ended October 3, 2015 included 14 and 27 weeks, respectively.  

2. NET INCOME PER SHARE 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share data): 

In the computation of diluted net income per share for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , outstanding options to purchase less than 0.1 million shares were excluded because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average market price of the underlying common stock and the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  In the computation of diluted net income per share for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , outstanding options to

purchase approximately   0.2 million   shares and   0.1 million   shares, respectively, were excluded because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average market price of the underlying common stock and the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The acquisition expanded the Company's offerings to include integrated RF solutions and systems-on-a-chip ("SoCs") for the connected home and the Internet of Things ("IoT").

The Notes were sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.  The carrying value of issuance costs related to the Notes is   $11.4 million   as of   October 1, 2016   and   $11.9 million   as of   April 2, 2016  , and is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction of Long-term debt.

Credit Agreement 
  On April 7, 2015, the Company and the Guarantors entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the  Administrative Agent ), swing line lender, and L/C issuer, and a syndicate of lenders (the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement includes a   $300.0 million   revolving credit facility, which includes a   $25.0 million   sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a   $10.0 million   sublimit for swing line loans. The Company may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed   $150.0 million  .  The revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.  The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Guarantors.  During the   six months ended     October 1, 2016  , there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  The Company had no outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement as of   October 1, 2016   and   April 2, 2016  .  
    
  At the Company s option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (i) the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Applicable Rate plus a rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%  , (b) the prime rate of the Administrative Agent, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate plus   1.0%   (the  Base Rate ).  All swing line loans will bear interest at a rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus the Base Rate.  The Eurodollar Base Rate is the rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, as published by Bloomberg, for dollar deposits for interest periods of one, two, three or six months, as selected by the Company.  The Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate loans ranges from   1.50%   per annum to   2.00%   per annum.  The Applicable Rate for Base Rate loans ranges from   0.50%   per annum to   1.00%   per annum.  Interest for Eurodollar Rate loans will be payable at the end of each applicable interest period or at three-month intervals, if such interest period exceeds three months.  Interest for Base Rate loans will be payable quarterly in arrears.  The Company will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Rate multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit, a fronting fee, and any customary documentary and processing charges for any letter of credit issued under the Credit Agreement.  
    
  The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which the Company must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default, including financial covenants that the Company must maintain.  On November 12, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the size of certain of the negative covenant baskets and the threshold for certain negative covenant incurrence-based permissions and to raise the consolidated leverage ratio test from   2.50   to   1.00   to   3.00   to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  The Company must also maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than   3.00   to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  
    
  The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, and the occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by   2.00%   and could result in the termination of commitments under the revolving credit facility, the declaration that all outstanding loans are due and payable in whole or in part and the requirement of cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit.  Outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of April 7, 2020 (with amounts borrowed under the swing line option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made).  

6. INCOME TAXES  
    
  Income Tax Expense 
  The Company s provision for income taxes for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   has been calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  ordinary  income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . 
    
  The Company s income tax   expense   was   $17.9 million   and   $13.9 million   for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, and the Company's income tax   expense   was   $13.8 million   and   $14.4 million   for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , respectively.  The Company s effective tax rate was   60.1%   and   69.2%   for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, and   75.7%   and   69.0%   for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , respectively.  The Company's effective tax rate for both the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   and the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax rate differences in foreign jurisdictions, state income taxes, domestic tax credits generated, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.

Deferred Taxes 
  A valuation allowance remained against certain domestic and foreign net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized.   
    
  The Company has domestic federal and state tax net operating loss ( NOLs ) carry-forwards that expire in fiscal years 2017 to 2036 if unused.  The use of the NOLs that were acquired in prior year acquisitions is subject to certain annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state income tax provisions.   
    
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
  The Company s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from   $69.1 million   as of the end of fiscal 2016 to   $79.4 million   as of the end of the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , due to a   $10.3 million     increase   related to tax positions taken with respect to the current fiscal year.

  On August 4, 2015, the Company invested   $25.0 million   to acquire shares of Series F Preferred Stock of Cavendish Kinetics Limited, a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales.  This investment is accounted for as a cost method investment and classified in "Long-term investments" on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.    No   impairment was recognized on the Company's cost-method investment during the   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  On a quarterly basis, the Company measures the fair value of its marketable securities, which are comprised of U.S. government/agency securities, corporate debt, auction rate securities (ARS), and money market funds.  Marketable securities are reported at fair value in "Cash and cash equivalents," "Short-term investments" and "Long-term investments" on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The related unrealized gains and losses are included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss," a component of stockholders  equity, net of tax.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The fair value of the financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis was determined using the following levels of inputs as of   October 1, 2016   and   April 2, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) ARS are debt instruments with interest rates that reset through periodic short-term auctions.  The Company s Level 2 ARS are valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active.  
  (2) Corporate debt includes corporate bonds and commercial paper that are valued using observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. 
  (3) The Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan provides eligible employees and members of the Board of Directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation.  The Company includes the assets deferred by the participants in the  Other current assets  and  Other non-current assets  line items of its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Company's obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the "Other current liabilities" and  Other long-term liabilities  line items of its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Other Fair Value Disclosures 
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities approximate fair values because of the relatively short-term maturities of these instruments.  See Note 5 for the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.

8. STOCK REPURCHASES 
    
  During the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company completed share repurchases under two programs approved by its Board of Directors under which it repurchased on the open market approximately   2.4 million   shares for   $150.0 million   and approximately   7.3 million   shares for   $400.0 million  . 
    
  On November 5, 2015, the Company announced a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to   $1.0 billion   of the Company's outstanding stock through November 4, 2016.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased approximately   4.6 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $250 million   and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased approximately   10.0 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $500.0 million  .  The amounts for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 reflect shares repurchased pursuant to variable maturity accelerated shares repurchase ("ASR") agreements that the Company entered into with Bank of America, N.A. on February 16, 2016 as part of the   $1.0 billion   share repurchase program described above.  Final settlements of the ASR agreements were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with an additional   0.4 million   shares received.   
    
  During the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased approximately   1.6 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $91.4 million  .  

9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective 
    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-16,   "  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory"  , which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.  The new standard will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force."    The new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."    The new guidance introduces an approach based on current expected losses over the life of the exposure to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments.  It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."    The new guidance will simplify certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards on the balance sheet and presentation on the statement of cash flows.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842)."    The new standard will revise the current guidance for lessees, lessors and sale-leaseback transactions.  Under the new guidance, substantially all lessees will now recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all of their leases with terms greater than 12 months even if the lease is an operating lease. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flow arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The new guidance becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

  (Unaudited) 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurements of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."    This new standard will affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities measured under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the assessment of valuation allowances when recognizing deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.  The new standard is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."    Entities that measure their inventory other than pursuant to the last-in, last-out and retail inventory methods will measure their inventory at the lower of cost or net realized value.  Net realized value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs to completion, transportation, or disposal.  Currently, inventory is required to be measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be the replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximated normal profit margin.  The Company will adopt the provisions of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.   
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"   that amends existing guidance on revenue recognition.  The new guidance is based on principles that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services.  The guidance requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows and both qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers and applied significant judgments.  The FASB has issued several amendments to the new guidance.  In August 2015, they delayed the effective date for adoption by one year.  In March 2016, additional guidance was issued that clarifies the principal versus agent considerations within the new revenue standard.  In April, 2016, additional guidance was issued that clarifies the identification of distinct performance obligations in a contract as well as clarifies the accounting for licenses of intellectual property.  In May 2016, additional guidance was issued related to transition, collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.  The new amended guidance will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, using one of two retrospective methods of adoption.  The Company has not determined which method it will adopt and is evaluating the effects the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05  , "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  " which provided additional guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  Under this guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license, customers should account for the license element of the arrangement in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If the arrangement does not contain a software license, customers should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  The Company adopted the provisions of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and there was no impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."    This standard requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, as a result of the change in provisional amounts, are to be included in the same period s financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amendments in this update became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and will be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur in the future.

The acquisition expanded the Company's offerings to include integrated RF solutions and SoCs for the connected home and the IoT. 
    
  The  All other  category includes operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, intellectual property rights (IPR) litigation settlement (costs), restructuring and disposal costs, start-up costs, gain (loss) on assets and other miscellaneous corporate overhead expenses that the Company does not allocate to its reportable segments because these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by the Company s CODM.  The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.  The Company s operating segments do not record intercompany revenue.  The Company does not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments.  Except as discussed above regarding the  All other  category, the Company s accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

our ability to procure, commercialize and enforce intellectual property rights (IPR) and to operate our business without infringing on the unlicensed IPR of others; 

the risks associated with security breaches and other similar disruptions, which could compromise our information and expose us to liability and could cause our business and reputation to suffer; 

currency fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers, tax and export license requirements and health and security issues associated with our foreign operations;  

the impact of  stringent environmental regulations; 

the adverse impact of any future decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings;

SECOND   QUARTER FISCAL   2017   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS: 

Quarterly revenue   increased     22.1%   as compared to the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2016  , due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions for smartphones, wireless infrastructure and WiFi products, as well as the addition of GreenPeak revenue. 

Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was   36.6%   as compared to   40.2%   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2016  .  Although year-over-year revenue   increased   substantially, gross margin was adversely impacted by several factors, including an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin products, average selling price erosion and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to quality issues and lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on a high volume part.  

Operating   income   was   $45.4 million   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2017   as compared to operating   income   of   $18.0 million   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2016  .  This improvement was primarily due to increased gross profit, lower stock-based compensation expense and lower intangible asset amortization expense.  These increases in operating income were partially offset by higher personnel expense primarily driven by increased manufacturing and research and development headcount. 

Cash flow from operations was   $250.0 million   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2017   as compared to   $168.8 million   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2016  .  This year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to changes in working capital and higher profitability.  

Capital expenditures were   $120.0 million   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2017   as compared to   $80.3 million   for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2016  .  This year-over-year increase was primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and projects for manufacturing cost savings initiatives. 

During the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded interest expense of   $17.3 million   (which was offset by   $2.4 million   of capitalized interest) on the   $1.0 billion   of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately   1.6 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $91.4 million  .

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Consolidated 
    
  The following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   (in thousands, except percentages):    

Revenue increased for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions for smartphones, wireless infrastructure and WiFi products, as well as the addition of GreenPeak revenue. 
    
  Gross margin for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   was   36.6%   and   38.0%  , respectively, as compared to   40.2%   and   40.8%  , respectively, for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  .  Although year-over-year revenue increased substantially, gross margin was adversely impacted by several factors, including an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin products, average selling price erosion and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to quality issues and lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on a high volume part.  
    
  Operating income increased for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , primarily due to increased gross profit, lower stock-based compensation expense and lower intangible asset amortization expense.  These increases in operating income were partially offset by higher personnel expense primarily driven by increased manufacturing and research and development headcount. 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense included in operating expense for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   included post-combination service award expense related to the Business Combination.  As the requisite service periods roll-off, the stock-based compensation expense associated with the Business Combination will continue to decline. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Research and development expense   increased   for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel expense associated with the

     Table of Contents  

design and development of high-performance filter based products as well as the addition of GreenPeak expenses, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.   
    
  Marketing and selling expense   increased   slightly for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  . 
    
  General and administrative expense   increased   slightly for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   months ended   October 3, 2015  .  General and administrative expense   decreased   slightly for the   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  .   
    
  Other operating expense   decreased   for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , primarily due to lower restructuring and integration costs associated with the Business Combination, as well as lower start-up costs. 
    
  Segment Product Revenue, Operating Income and Operating Income as a Percentage of Revenue 
    
  Mobile Products 

MP revenue increased for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , primarily due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions for smartphones.   
    
  The decrease in MP operating income as a percentage of revenue for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015   was primarily due to lower gross margin resulting from an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin products, average selling price erosion, unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to quality issues and lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on a high volume part and increased personnel expense primarily related to the design and development of high-performance filter based products.

Infrastructure and Defense Products   

Revenue increased for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , primarily due to improved global demand for our wireless infrastructure and WiFi products, as well as the inclusion of GreenPeak revenue in the three and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  The increase in IDP operating income as a percentage of revenue for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   three   months ended   October 3, 2015   was primarily due to increased revenue and lower unfavorable inventory adjustments.  
    
  The increase in IDP operating income as a percentage of revenue for the   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   as compared to the   six   months ended   October 3, 2015   was primarily due to increased revenue, favorable factory utilization, lower unfavorable inventory adjustments and favorable product mix. 
    
  See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the consolidated operating income (loss) for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . 

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME AND INCOME TAXES 

Interest Expense  
  During the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recorded interest expense of   $17.3 million   and   $34.8 million  , respectively, related to the   $1.0 billion   of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  Interest expense in the preceding table for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   is net of capitalized interest of   $2.4 million   and   $5.4 million  , respectively.  
    
  Other (Expense) Income  
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold equity securities and recognized a gain of approximately   $4.0 million  . 
    
  Income Taxes  
  Our provision for income taxes for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   has been calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  ordinary  income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the   three   and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . 
    
  For the three and   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , we had an income tax expense of   $17.9 million   and   $13.9 million  , respectively, which was comprised primarily of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax

     Table of Contents  

book income offset by a tax benefit related to international operations generating pre-tax book losses.  For the three and   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  , income tax expense was   $13.8 million   and   $14.4 million  , respectively, which was comprised primarily of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book income offset by a tax benefit related to international operations generating pre-tax book losses. 
    
  A valuation allowance remained against certain domestic and foreign net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  We have funded our operations to date through revenue from product sales, sales of equity and debt securities, bank borrowings and capital equipment leases.  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had working capital of approximately   $1,025.1 million  , including   $469.2 million   in cash and cash equivalents, compared to working capital of approximately   $1,135.4 million   at   April 2, 2016  , including   $425.9 million   in cash and cash equivalents.  
    
  Our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were   $469.2 million   as of   October 1, 2016  .  This balance includes approximately   $273.9 million   held by our foreign subsidiaries.  If the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate.  Our current plans are to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.  
    
  Stock Repurchases 
  On November 5, 2015, we announced a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to   $1.0 billion   of our outstanding stock through November 4, 2016.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately   4.6 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $250.0 million   and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately   10.0 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $500.0 million  .  The amounts for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 reflect shares repurchased pursuant to variable maturity accelerated shares repurchase ("ASR") agreements that we entered into with Bank of America, N.A. on February 16, 2016 as part of the   $1.0 billion   share repurchase program described above.  Final settlements of the ASR agreements were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with an additional 0.4 million shares received.   
    
  During the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately   1.6 million   shares of our common stock pursuant to this authorization for approximately   $91.4 million  .  
    
  On November 3, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to   $500.0 million   of our outstanding stock.  The new repurchase program includes approximately   $158.6 million   authorized on a prior program that was set to expire on November 4, 2016.  Under the share repurchase program, share repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The extent to which we repurchase our shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.  The program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares and does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.   
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Operating activities for the   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   generated cash of   $309.4 million  , compared to   $310.2 million   for the   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  .  
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
  Net cash   used in   investing activities for the   six   months ended   October 1, 2016   was   $187.0 million   as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of   $25.5 million   for the   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  .  This year over year increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the acquisition of GreenPeak and increased capital expenditures (primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and projects for manufacturing cost savings initiatives).   
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash   used in   financing activities was   $79.0 million   for the   six   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to   $465.9 million   for the   six   months ended   October 3, 2015  .  This year over year decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by lower share repurchase activity, which was partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Credit Agreement      On April 7, 2015, we and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ) entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender, and L/C issuer, and a syndicate of lenders (the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement includes a   $300.0 million   revolving credit facility, which includes a   $25.0 million   sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a   $10.0 million   sublimit for swing line loans.  We may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed   $150.0 million  .  The revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Guarantors.  We had no outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement as of   October 1, 2016  .  
    
  The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default, including financial covenants that we must maintain.  On November 12, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the size of certain of the negative covenant baskets and the threshold for certain negative covenant incurrence-based permissions and to raise the consolidated leverage ratio test from 2.50 to 1.00 to   3.00   to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  We must also maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than   3.00   to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  At   October 1, 2016  , we were in full compliance with these covenants. 
    
  Notes Offering      On November 19, 2015, we completed an offering of   $450.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   senior notes due December 1, 2023 and   $550.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   7.00%   senior notes due December 1, 2025 (collectively the  Notes ).  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our revolving credit facility.  Interest on both series of the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year and commenced on June 1, 2016. 
    
  The indenture governing the Notes contains customary events of default, including among other things, payment default, exchange default, failure to provide certain notices thereunder and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events.  The indenture also contains customary negative covenants. 
    
  We completed an exchange offer on September 19, 2016 under which substantially all of the Notes were exchanged for senior notes registered under the Securities Act (see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
    
  Capital Commitments    At   October 1, 2016  , we had capital commitments of approximately   $124.3 million   primarily related to projects increasing premium filter capacity, projects for manufacturing cost savings initiatives, constructing a new office and design center, equipment replacements and general corporate purposes.  
    
  Future Sources of Funding    Our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, market acceptance of and demand for our products, acquisition opportunities, technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers.  Based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations, coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our short-term and long-term cash requirements.  However, if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products, or in the event that growth is faster than we had anticipated, operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs.  If existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable, we may seek additional debt or equity financing.  We cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will not be dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Further, we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing, if required, will be available on favorable terms, if at all. 
    
  Legal    We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business that have not been fully adjudicated.  These actions, when finally concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
    
  Taxes    We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions.  Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  We are subject to audits by tax authorities.  While we endeavor to comply with all applicable tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law than we do or that we will comply in all respects with applicable tax laws, which could result in additional taxes.  There can be no assurance that the outcomes from tax audits will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period during which the review is conducted.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
    
  There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures during the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2017  .  For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  contained in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 2, 2016  . 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of   October 1, 2016  , of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   October 1, 2016  , as we cannot conclude that the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for income taxes described in Part II, Item 9A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016 has been fully remediated as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Update on Remediation Plan 
    
  During the quarter ended   October 1, 2016  , we made substantial progress toward remediating the material weakness that existed in accounting for income taxes as of April 2, 2016.  Our remediation plan is subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight.  As part of such plan, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: 

We have implemented a single income tax provision model in conjunction with completing our move to a single integrated ERP system. 
                
    We have filled three open positions within the tax department.  We will continue to evaluate the structure of our tax organization and add resources as needed. 
                
    With the assistance of a qualified outside party, we have undergone a review and assessment of our internal controls over accounting for income taxes and the tax provision process.  Based on that review and assessment, we are in process of redesigning and enhancing our procedures to improve the effectiveness of the internal controls related to accounting for income taxes. 
       
  The Company believes that the remediation steps completed to date have significantly improved our internal control over the accounting for income taxes.  However, the Company expects to continue to further strengthen internal controls over accounting for income taxes and make additional improvements in the tax provision process during the remainder of fiscal 2017.  Until these remediation steps are fully implemented and tested, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
    
  Other than the remediation steps described above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report and in our other reports and statements that we file with the SEC, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.,  Risk Factors  in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 2, 2016  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  The risks described in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
    
  (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  
    
  Purchases of Equity Securities 

On November 5, 2015, the Company announced a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to   $1.0 billion   of the Company's outstanding stock through November 4, 2016.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of its common stock for approximately $250.0 million and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 10.0 million shares of its common stock for approximately $500.0 million.  The amounts for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 reflect shares repurchased pursuant to variable maturity accelerated shares repurchase ("ASR") agreements that the Company entered into with Bank of America, N.A. on February 16, 2016 as part of the   $1.0 billion   share repurchase program described above.  Final settlements of the ASR agreements were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with an additional 0.4 million shares received.   
    
  During the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased approximately   1.6 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $91.4 million  . 
    
  On November 3, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to   $500.0 million   of the Company's outstanding stock.  The new repurchase program includes approximately   $158.6 million   authorized on a prior program that was set to expire on November 4, 2016.  Under the share repurchase program, share repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.  The program does not require the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares and does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.

QORVO, INC. 
  CASH BONUS PLAN 
  (As Amended and Restated Through June 9, 2016) 
    
           1. 
    Purpose; Plan Background 
     The purpose of the Qorvo, Inc. Cash Bonus Plan, as previously amended and as it may be further amended (the "Plan"), is to provide selected employees of Qorvo, Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively, the "Company") with the opportunity to earn awards in the form of cash bonuses based upon attainment of preestablished, objective performance goals, thereby promoting a closer identification of the participating employees' interests with the interests of the Company and its stockholders, and further stimulating such employees' efforts to enhance the efficiency, profitability, growth and value of the Company.  
           2. 
    Plan Administration     
     (a)        Administration  :  The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company or a subcommittee of the Committee.  To the extent required by   Section   162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Committee shall be comprised of at least two members and each member of the Committee (or subcommittee of the Committee) shall be an "outside director" as defined in Code   Section   162(m) and related regulations.  In addition, the members of the Compensation Committee shall be deemed independent if and to the extent required under Section 10C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and applicable rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or other applicable stock exchange or national securities association.  In addition to action by meeting in accordance with applicable laws, any action of the Committee with respect to the Plan may be taken by a written instrument signed (including any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000) by all of the members of the Committee, and any such action so taken by written consent shall be as fully effective as if it had been taken by a majority of the members at a meeting duly held and called.  
  (b)        Administrator Authority  :  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have full authority in its discretion to take any action with respect to the Plan, including, but not limited to, the authority to (i) determine all matters relating to awards, including selection of individuals to be granted awards and all terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations of an award; and (ii) construe and interpret the Plan and any instruments evidencing awards granted under the Plan, to establish and interpret rules and regulations for administering the Plan and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.  The Committee's authority to grant awards and authorize payments under the Plan shall not in any way restrict the authority of the Committee to grant compensation to employees under any other compensation plan or program of the Company.  The Committee also shall have the authority and discretion to establish terms and conditions of awards (including but not limited to the establishment of subplans) as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to the applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions outside of the United States.  Any decision made, or action taken, by the Committee in connection with the administration of the Plan shall be final, binding and conclusive.   

(c)        Delegation of Authority  :  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may delegate the administration of the Plan to one or more of its designees (subject to any conditions imposed by the Committee), but only with respect to matters which would not affect the deductibility under Code Section 162(m) of compensation paid under the Plan to "covered employees" (as such term is defined in Code Section 162(m) and related regulations) to the extent such compensation is intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), or as may otherwise be permitted under applicable laws, rules or regulations.  In the case of any such delegation, references to the "Committee" herein shall include such designee or designees, unless the context otherwise requires.  No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any action, determination or decision made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award paid under it.  The members of the Board and the Committee shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner and to the fullest extent provided in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.  
           3. 
    Eligibility 
     The participants in the Plan (individually, a "participant," and collectively, the "participants") shall be those employees of the Company who are designated from time to time by the Committee or its designees as being eligible to participate under the Plan based on criteria established from time to time by or at the direction of the Committee.  Participation in the Plan for any one performance period does not guarantee that an employee will be entitled to participate in any other performance period.  For the purposes of the Plan, "performance period" shall mean a period established by the Committee during which performance shall be measured to determine if any payment will be made under the Plan. A performance period may be coincident with one or more fiscal years or fiscal quarters of the Company, or any portion thereof, and performance periods may be overlapping.   
           4. 
    Nature of Awards 
     Awards granted under the Plan shall be in the form of cash bonuses. 
   (a)        Grant of Awards:    At the time performance objectives are established for a performance period as provided in Section 5(b) herein, the Committee also shall assign to each participant a target cash bonus award applicable for the particular performance period (each, a "target bonus").  A participant's award, if any, shall be earned based on the attainment of written performance objectives approved by the Committee for a specified performance period, as provided in Section 5(b) herein.  In the case of awards granted to covered employees that are intended to comply with Code Section 162(m), designation of such covered employees and such performance objectives shall be established by the Committee (i) while the outcome for the performance period is substantially uncertain, and (ii) (A) no more than 90 days after the commencement of the performance period to which the performance objective relates and (B) before 25% of the relevant performance period has elapsed (or otherwise at such time and upon such terms as to ensure that the award will, to the extent practicable, qualify as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Code   Section   162(m)).  During any fiscal year of the Company, no participant may be granted more than the maximum award limitation stated in Section 5(d) herein.  The Committee may adjust awards as appropriate for partial achievement of goals, exemplary effort on the part of a participant and/or other external, extraordinary or mitigating circumstances and may also interpret and make necessary and appropriate adjustments to performance  
  
   2 

goals and the manner in which such performance goals are evaluated; provided, however, that, except as may be otherwise provided in Section 6 or Section 7, no such adjustment shall be made with respect to an award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) and granted under the Plan to a participant who is a "covered employee" if such adjustment would cause the award to fail to qualify as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Code   Section   162(m).   
  (b)        Performance Objectives  :  For each performance period, the Committee shall establish one or more specific performance measures and specific goals for each participant, for each group of participants or for all participants.  The performance objectives established by the Committee shall be based on one or more performance measures that apply to the individual participant ("individual performance"), to a business unit or function at the Company ("business unit/function performance"), to the Company as a whole ("corporate performance"), or to any combination of individual performance, business unit/function performance or corporate performance.  Without limiting the foregoing, performance goals for business unit/function performance may be set for an identifiable business group, division, segment, unit, affiliate, facility, product line, product or function (such as sales, manufacturing or research and development).  If a participant's performance goals are based on a combination of individual performance, business unit/function performance and/or corporate performance, the Committee may weight the importance of each type of performance that applies to such participant by assigning a percentage to it.  In the case of awards granted to participants that are intended to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception under Code Section 162(m), the performance objectives shall be objective and shall be based upon one or more of the following criteria, as determined by the Committee:  (i) revenues or sales; (ii) gross margins, operating margins or profit margins; (iii) earnings (including net income or loss, operating profit; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before or after taxes;; and earnings before special or extraordinary items) or earnings, income or loss per share; (iv) net bookings; (v) product production or shipments; (vi) income, net income, operating income, net operating income, net operating profit, controllable profits, pre-tax profit or operating margin; (vii) book value per share; (viii) return on stockholders' equity, return on investment, return on assets or net assets, return on capital, return on invested capital, return on sales or return on revenues; (ix) improvements in capital structure; (x) expense management; (xi) debt reduction or debt levels; (xii) maintenance or improvement of gross margins, operating margins or profit margins; (xiii) stock price or total stockholder return; (xiv) market share; (xv) profitability; (xvi) costs; (xvii) cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow return on investment (discounted or otherwise), net cash provided by operations, or cash flow in excess of cost of capital; (xviii) working capital; (xix) economic wealth created; (xx) operational performance, including orders, backlog, deferred revenues, revenue per employee, overhead, days sales outstanding, inventory turns, or other expense levels; (xxi) minimum cash balances, (xxii) asset turns; (xxiii) product or technological developments; and/or (xxiv) strategic business criteria, based on meeting specified goals or objectives related to market penetration, new products, design wins, geographic business expansion, cost targets, reductions and savings, improvement in or attainment of working capital levels, productivity and efficiencies, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, management of employment practices and employee benefits, workforce diversity, management of litigation, management of information technology, goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures of products, product lines, subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures, quality matrices, customer service matrices, negotiation of transactions, formation of joint ventures, research or development collaborations, completion of corporate transactions and/or execution of pre-approved corporate strategy.  In addition, with respect to awards granted to participants that are not intended to qualify for  
  
   3 

the performance-based compensation exception under Code Section 162(m), the Committee may approve performance objectives based on other criteria, which may or may not be objective.  The foregoing criteria may relate to the Company, one or more of its affiliates or one or more of its divisions, units, partnerships, joint venturers or minority investments, facilities, product lines or products or any combination of the foregoing.  The targeted level or levels of performance with respect to such business criteria may be established at such levels and on such terms as the Committee may determine, in its discretion, including but not limited to on an absolute basis, in relation to performance in a prior performance period, and/or relative to one or more peer group companies or indices, or any combination thereof. In addition, the performance measures may be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 11(i) herein. 
  (c)        Earning of Awards:    As soon as practicable after the end of the performance period, the Committee shall determine whether the performance goals for the performance period were achieved and, if so, at what level of achievement under specific formulae established for the performance period.   If the performance goals were met for the performance period, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, of the award earned by each participant and such award shall be paid in accordance with Section 5(e) herein (subject, however, to the limitation on awards stated in Section 5(d) herein). 
  (d)        Maximum Award Payable to Any One Participant  :  Other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the maximum amount of cash bonus awards that may be granted under the Plan to any one participant in any one fiscal year shall not exceed $5,000,000. 
  (e)        Payment of Awards:    An award earned by a participant with respect to a performance period shall be paid to him following the determination of the amount, if any, of the award and, with respect to participants who are covered employees, the Committee's written certification (which may be by approval of the minutes from the meeting in which the certification was made or by a written certification signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company who attended the Committee meeting of the certifications made by the Committee in its meeting, or other approval made in accordance with Code Section 162(m)) that the participant achieved his performance goals.  Without limiting the foregoing, awards payable under the Plan shall be paid no later than the later of (i) the 15   th    day of the third month following the end of the participant's first taxable year in which the right to payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or (ii) the 15   th    day of the third month following the end of the Company's first taxable year in which the right to payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or shall otherwise be structured in a manner to be exempt from, or in compliance with, Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the Company reasonably anticipates that any deduction for its payment would be limited or eliminated by Code Section 162(m), such payment may be delayed until the earlier of the following: (i) the date which is as soon as reasonably practicable following the first date on which the Company reasonably anticipates that the deduction will not be limited or eliminated by Code Section 162(m), or (ii) the date which is as soon as reasonably practicable following the end of the calendar year in which the participant separates from service, or such payment shall be otherwise structured so as to comply with Code Section 409A, related regulations and other guidance. The Committee shall not have any discretion to increase the amount of an award earned and payable pursuant to the terms of the Plan, to the extent such compensation is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) (except to the extent otherwise provided pursuant to Section 7 herein in the event of a change of control).  The Committee shall have the unilateral discretion to reduce or eliminate the amount of an award granted to any participant, including an award otherwise earned and payable pursuant to the terms of the Plan.   
  
   4 

6. 
    Termination of Employment and Other Events; Covenants 
     The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of employment by the participant or other event prior to the end of a performance period or prior to payment of such awards. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a participant dies, retires, is granted a leave of absence, or if the participant's employment is otherwise terminated (except for cause by the Company): (a) during a performance period, then a pro rata share of the participant's award based on the period of actual participation may, at the Committee's discretion, be paid to the participant after the end of the performance period if and to the extent that it would have become earned and payable had the participant's employment status not changed, and (b) after the completion of a performance period in which an award has been earned, but prior to the date of payment of such award, then such award shall be paid to the former employee participant. The Committee may require a participant, as a condition to the grant or payment of an award, to enter or have entered into agreements or covenants with the Company obligating the participant to not compete, to not interfere with the relationships of the Company with customers, suppliers or employees in any way, to refrain from disclosing or misusing confidential or proprietary information of the Company, and to take or refrain from taking such other actions adverse to the Company as the Committee may specify.  The form of such agreements or covenants shall be specified by the Committee, which may vary such form from time to time and require renewal of the agreements or covenants, as then specified by the Committee, in connection with the allocation or payout of any award.  For the purposes herein, termination for "cause" shall mean termination for cause under the terms of any employment, consulting, change in control or similar agreement, plan or program, if any, between the Company and the participant, or, if the participant has not entered into any such agreement, plan or program (or if any such agreement, plan or program does not define "cause"), "cause" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term under Qorvo, Inc.'s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (as it may be further amended, or any successor to such stock incentive plan, the "Stock Plan"). 
           7. 
    Change of Control 
     (a)        Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, and except as may be otherwise provided in Section 7(b) herein, in the event of a "change of control" (as defined in   Section   7(c)), all outstanding awards under the Plan shall be deemed to be earned at target bonus based on the assumption that any applicable performance goals were met in full; provided, however, that the amount of any such target bonus shall be reduced on a pro rata basis, so that the participant shall only receive a pro rata portion of the target bonus for each completed month of the applicable performance period which had elapsed when the change of control occurred.  By way of example (and not limitation), if (i) a participant would have been entitled to a $100,000 target bonus based on attainment of applicable performance goals during a 12-month performance period, and (ii) a change of control occurs during the seventh month of the performance period, the participant shall be entitled to a $50,000 bonus (one-half of the $100,000 target bonus that would otherwise have been payable if the full performance period had elapsed), treating any applicable performance goals as being fully met. In the event of a change of control, any bonuses payable under Section 7 shall be immediately due and payable, without regard to whether such bonuses are deductible under Code Section 162(m) and without regard to whether the participant continues in service in the same position following the change of control, has a change in position or responsibility, or is terminated from employment with the Company (or successor or surviving corporation). In addition, without in any way limiting the preceding, in the event that a participant has entered into an employment agreement, change in control agreement or similar agreement, plan or  
  
   5 

program with or of the Company, the participant shall be entitled to the greater of the benefits payable upon a change of control of the Company pursuant to Section 7 herein or the respective employment agreement, change in control agreement or similar agreement, plan or program, and such employment agreement, change in control agreement or similar agreement, plan or program shall not be construed to reduce in any way the benefits otherwise payable to a participant upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the Plan.  
  (b)        Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7(a), in the event that a change of control occurs, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine that any or all awards granted pursuant to the Plan shall be deemed to be earned in an amount greater than the amount of pro rata bonus payments that would otherwise be payable under Section 7(a) herein, up to the maximum bonus opportunity. In the event of a change of control, the Company or the surviving or acquiring corporation shall not take any action to reduce the awards granted pursuant to the Plan below the amount of pro rata payments that would otherwise be payable under Section 7(a) herein. 
  (c)        For the purposes herein, for each participant, a "change of control" shall have the definition given the term "change in control" in the participant's change in control agreement with the Company, or, if the participant has not entered into a change in control agreement with the Company, then a "change of control" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term under the Stock Plan. 
           8. 
    No Right to Employment  
     Nothing contained in this Plan or any action taken pursuant to the Plan shall be construed as conferring upon any participant the right or imposing upon him the obligation to continue in the employment of or service to the Company, nor shall it be construed as imposing upon the Company the obligation to continue the employment or service of a participant.  Except as may be otherwise provided in the Plan or determined by the Committee, all rights of a participant with respect to an award and distribution of any cash payment subject to an award shall terminate and be forfeited upon a participant's termination of employment or service with the Company.  
           9. 
    Amendment and Termination     
     The Board of Directors of the Company may amend, discontinue or terminate the Plan in whole or in part at any time, provided that (a) approval of an amendment to the Plan by the stockholders of the Company shall be required to the extent, if any, that stockholder approval of such amendment is required by applicable laws, rules or regulations; and (b) except as otherwise provided in Section 5(e), no such amendment, discontinuance or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect any award earned and payable under the Plan as of the date of such amendment or termination without the participant's consent.  However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and any award (without participant consent) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or changes to applicable laws, rules or regulations (including but in no way limited to Code Section 162(m) and Code Section 409A, related regulations and other guidance), and to reduce or eliminate the amount of an award, as provided in Section 5(e). 
   The Plan became effective on June 1, 2006, following approval by the Board and the stockholders of the Company as required by Code   Section   162(m) and related regulations.  The Plan was amended  
  
   6 

and restated effective June 20, 2011, January 1, 2015 and June 9, 2016, subject to stockholder approval as required by Code Section 162(m).  To the extent required under Code Section 162(m), awards under the Plan granted prior to any required stockholder approval shall be conditioned upon and shall be payable only upon approval of such performance criteria by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 162(m).   
   (a)        Taxes; Offset  : Any tax required to be withheld by any government authority shall be deducted from each award.  The Company has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for the participant or any other person.  Participants are solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may arise in connection with awards (including any taxes arising under Code Section 409A), and the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold any participant harmless from any or all of such taxes.  The Committee, in its sole discretion (but subject to applicable law), may apply any amounts payable to any participant hereunder as a setoff to satisfy any liabilities owed to the Company by the participant.   
  (b)        Nonassignability  : Unless the Committee determines otherwise, awards and any other rights under the Plan shall not be subject to anticipation, alienation, pledge, transfer or assignment by any person entitled thereto, except by designation of a beneficiary or by will or the laws of intestate succession. 
  (c)        No Trust; Unfunded Plan  :  The obligation of the Company to make payments hereunder shall constitute a liability of the Company to the participants.  Such payments shall be made from the general funds of the Company, and the Company shall not be required to establish or maintain any special or separate fund, or otherwise to segregate assets to assure that such payments shall be made, and neither the participants nor their beneficiaries shall have any interest in any particular assets of the Company by reason of its obligations hereunder.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall create or be construed as creating a trust of any kind or any other fiduciary relationship between the Company and the participants or any other person or constitute a guarantee that the assets of the Company shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Company.   
  (d)        Impact of Plan Award on other Plans:    Awards granted pursuant to the Plan shall not be treated as compensation for purposes of any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company, unless either (i) such other plan, program or arrangement provides that compensation in the form of awards payable under the Plan are to be considered as compensation thereunder, or (ii) the Committee so determines.  The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other incentive or other compensation plans or programs in effect for the Company, nor shall the Plan preclude the Company from establishing any other forms of incentive or other compensation for employees of the Company. 
  (e)        Facility of Payments  : If a participant or any other person entitled to receive an award under this Plan (the "recipient") shall, at the time payment of any such amount is due, be incapacitated so that such recipient cannot legally receive or acknowledge receipt of the payment, then the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may direct that the payment be made to the legal guardian, attorney- 
  
   7 

in-fact or person with whom such recipient is residing, and such payment shall be in full satisfaction of the Company's obligation under the Plan with respect to such amount. 
  (f)        Beneficiary Designation  : The Committee may permit a participant to designate in writing a person or persons as beneficiary, which beneficiary shall be entitled to receive settlement of awards, if any, to which the participant is otherwise entitled in the event of death. In the absence of such designation by a participant, and in the event of the participant's death, the estate of the participant shall be treated as beneficiary for purposes of the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise.  The Committee shall have sole discretion to approve and interpret the form or forms of such beneficiary designation. 
  (g)        Governing Law  : The Plan shall be construed and its provisions enforced and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws, and in accordance with applicable federal laws. 
  (h)        Compliance with Code   Section   162(m)  : The Company intends that compensation under the Plan payable to covered employees will, to the extent practicable, constitute qualified "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Code   Section   162(m) and related regulations, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Accordingly, the provisions of the Plan shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with Code   Section   162(m) and related regulations if and to the extent required.  If any provision of the Plan or any award that is granted to a covered employee (in each case, other than payments to be made pursuant to Section 6 and/or Section 7 herein) does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Code   Section   162(m) or related regulations, such provision shall, to the extent practicable, be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. 
  (i)        Adjustments  : The Committee is authorized at any time before, during or after the completion of a performance period, in its sole discretion, to adjust or modify the terms of awards or performance objectives, or specify new awards, due to extraordinary items, transactions, events or developments, or in recognition of any other unusual, nonrecurring or infrequent events affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company, or in response to changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations, accounting principles, tax rates (and interpretations thereof), business conditions or the Committee's assessment of the business strategy of the Company, in each case as determined by the Committee (provided that any adjustment or modification involving covered employees for compensation that is intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m) shall be made in an objectively determinable manner and shall be subject to any applicable Code Section 162(m) restrictions).  To the extent that an award is not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), the Committee may make any other adjustments or modifications to the terms of awards or performance objectives selected by the Committee.  By way of example but not limitation, the Committee may provide with respect to any award that any evaluation of performance shall exclude or otherwise adjust for any specified circumstance or event that occurs during a performance period, including but not limited to circumstances or events such as the following:  currency fluctuations; discontinued operations; non-cash items, such as amortization, depreciation or reserves; asset impairment; significant litigation or claim judgments or settlements; any recapitalization, restructuring, reorganization, merger, acquisition, divestiture, consolidation, spin-off, split-up, combination, liquidation, dissolution, sale of assets, or other similar corporate transaction or event; the  
  
   8 

effects of stock-based compensation (including any modification charges) or other compensation; and/or any other specific unusual or infrequent events or objectively determinable category thereof.  
  (j)        Compliance with Code Section 409A:    Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or an award to the contrary, if and to the extent that Code Section 409A is deemed to apply to the Plan or any award granted under the Plan, it is the general intention of the Company that the Plan and any such award shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith.  Deferrals pursuant to an award otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A in a manner that would cause Code Section 409A to apply shall not be permitted unless such deferrals are permitted by the Committee and structured to be in compliance with or exempt from Code Section 409A.  Without in any way limiting the effect of the foregoing, (i) in the event that Code Section 409A requires that any special terms, provision or conditions be included in the Plan or any award, then such terms, provisions and conditions shall, to the extent practicable, be deemed to be made a part of the Plan and/or award, as applicable, and (ii) terms used in the Plan or an award shall be construed in accordance with Code Section 409A if and to the extent required.  Further, in the event that the Plan or any award shall be deemed not to comply with Code Section 409A, then neither the Company, the Board, the Committee nor its or their designees or agents shall be liable to any participant or other persons for actions, decisions or determinations made in good faith.  
  (k)        Restrictions on Awards:    Notwithstanding any other Plan provision to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to make any distribution of benefits under the Plan or take any other action, unless such distribution or action is in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to applicable requirements of the Code).   
  (l)        Gender and Number:    Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and words in the plural shall include the singular. 
  (m)        Severability:    If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

Exhibit 

SEVERANCE AGREEMENT 
  AND RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS 

This Severance Agreement and Release of All Claims (this  Agreement ) is made by and between Steven J. Buhaly ( Employee ) and Qorvo US, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. ( Qorvo ). 
    
  Reference is made to the Change of Control Policy, as amended and restated as of May 13, 2014 (the  Policy ), executed by the Parties and attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement. The terms of the Policy, as modified by this Agreement, are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Employee has provided notice of his resignation as an officer and retirement from Employer and by executing this Agreement, the Employee confirms that he has resigned as an officer, director or any other position or capacity with Employer as of the Termination Date. 
    
  This Agreement constitutes the  Release  described in Section 5 of the Policy and must be fully executed and not revoked by the Employee no later than September 29, 2016 for the provisions of this Agreement and the Policy to be enforceable by either Party. 
    
  In consideration of the mutual promises herein, the Parties agree as follows: 

(a) 
    As used in this Agreement,  Employee  shall mean Steven J. Buhaly and any spouse, heirs, executors, representatives, administrators, agents, attorneys and assigns, and any other person or entity acting with or on behalf of Steven J. Buhaly, and any other person claiming by, through or under Steven J. Buhaly.   
       
           (b) 
    As used in this Agreement,  Employer  shall mean Qorvo, its parent corporation Qorvo, Inc., and any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliated entities, successors and assigns. 
       
           (c) 
    As used in this Agreement,  Parties  shall mean Employee and Employer. 
       
           2. 
    Termination of Employment and Policy Payments  . 
       
           (a) 
    Employee s final termination date with Employer is July 30, 2016 (the  Termination Date ). 
       
           (b) 
    Employee will be paid a lump sum cash amount, payable no later than the next scheduled payroll period following the Termination Date, equal to the sum of (i) any accrued but unpaid base salary through the Termination Date, plus (ii) any accrued but unpaid paid time off (PTO) and vacation pay (collectively, the  Cash Payment ).  This lump sum Cash Payment, which we calculate to be a gross total of $46,092.62, will be subject to reduction to the extent you take PTO prior to your Termination Date and to applicable tax withholdings. 
       
           (c) 
    As consideration for this Agreement and for the Policy, the severance payments, the COBRA payments, and the acceleration of options and restricted stock awards set out in Section 4 of the Policy shall occur in accordance with the terms of the Policy and in accordance with the following additional terms: 
       
           1. 
    The Change of Control Effective Date under both this Agreement and the Policy shall be January 1, 2015. 

2. 
    The base salary to be paid to Employee pursuant to Section 4(a)(i) of the Policy in twenty-six (26) equal payments shall be $16,355.78 per two week pay period, with the first payment to be made on the first payroll date after the  Release Effective Date  (as defined in the Policy), and the total amount of the twenty-six (26) payments over twelve (12) months will be $425,250.18. 
       
           3. 
    The additional cash severance payment to be paid to Employee pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) of the Policy shall be a total payment of $340,200.14 to be paid in twenty-six (26) equal installments of $13,084.62, with the first payment to be made on the first payroll date after the Release Effective Date. 
       
           4. 
    Employee s medical and dental coverage under Employer s group health plans   (United Healthcare, Delta Dental/Moda Health, Tufts, Assurant, Kaiser NW, and Kaiser CA, as applicable)   will continue until July 31, 2016. Under a federal law known as COBRA, effective as of August 1, 2016, Employee and his covered dependents will be entitled to elect to continue medical and dental coverage for up to eighteen months (the  COBRA Period ).  COBRA is administered through Discovery Benefits, which will mail enrollment forms and instructions to Employee s home address following the Termination Date. To elect COBRA coverage, Employee must complete, sign and mail the application form to Discovery Benefits within 60 days of the Termination Date. Employee s medical and dental insurance providers will be notified and Employee s coverage will be reinstated retroactively to the group health plan termination date upon their receipt of your enrollment election and first payment. Enclosed is a COBRA rate sheet for medical and dental benefits.  To the extent the Employee timely elects COBRA continuation coverage under the Employer s group health plans, as set forth in Section 4(b) of the Policy the Employer will reimburse the Employee for the premiums paid by the Employee to continue Employee s current coverage (which is Employee plus spouse) for the period specified in Section 4(b) of the Policy.  The current rate of reimbursement is $549.39 per each bi-weekly pay period. Such reimbursement will commence following the commencement of Employee s COBRA coverage and will be made as specified in Section 4(b) of the Policy. 
       
           5. 
    All stock options granted by TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. prior to the Change of Control Effective Date shall accelerate and vest and become exercisable in full as of Release Effective Date.  Employee may exercise any such vested options until the original expiration date applicable to the options.  Outstanding vested options must be exercised through Employee s Fidelity account.  Employee may elect to do a same day sale, sell to cover, or exercise and hold. If Employee wants to exercise and hold the shares, Employee must deposit funds ahead of time into Employee s Fidelity account to cover the cost of the exercise. If the option is a non-qualified stock option, Employee will also need to pay tax at the time of exercise. 
       
           6. 
    All unvested restricted stock unit awards granted to Employee by TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. prior to the Change of Control Effective Date will accelerate and vest in full as of the Release Effective Date.  These shares will be net settled for payment of applicable taxes. 
       
  Employee agrees and acknowledges that the payments to be made to Employee in consideration for this Agreement and the Policy are in in lieu of any other severance payment under any other severance plan of Employer.  Employee acknowledges that Employee received full payment for all wages and salary due to Employee for Employee s services to the Employer up to and including the Termination Date and that Employee is not otherwise owed any additional wages, salary or other amounts except as specified in this Agreement, the Policy and the Consulting Agreement referenced below.  Employee also acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been properly provided all leaves of absence required by law and by the Employer s policies. 

3.      Qorvo Equity Awards.    All restricted stock unit awards granted to Employee by Qorvo, Inc. after the Change in Control Effective Date contain post-termination vesting provisions under which the awards would continue to vest following the Termination Date, subject to satisfaction by Employee of certain conditions both initially and on an ongoing basis.  To be eligible for such post-termination vesting, Employee must execute and deliver this Agreement and Employee must satisfy the other conditions specified in the applicable award agreements, including the  Post-Employment Condition  (as defined in the applicable award agreements).  Please note that restricted stock unit awards that vest following the Termination Date pursuant to these post-termination vesting provisions are subject to so-called  clawback  provisions under which you may become obligated to forfeit unvested awards, return vested shares without compensation and repay any  Gain  realized on vested shares under certain circumstances.  Employee should refer to his individual Fidelity account, the stock incentive plan under which his restricted stock awards were granted and his individual award agreements.   
    
  4.      Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Payments  .    As of July 1, 2016, Employee had a vested balance of approximately $1,126,447.11 under Employer s Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended (the  NQDC Plan ). Commencing on March 30, 2015 and in accordance with the NQDC Plan, a portion of Employee s vested balance under the NQDC Plan became subject to distributions to Employee in 60 quarterly installments; at July 1, 2016, approximately $592,232.49 of Employee s vested balance remained to be distributed over the 54 remaining quarterly installments. As a result of Employee s termination of employment, the remaining portion of Employee s vested balance under the NQDC Plan (approximately $534,214.16 at July, 1, 2016) will be distributed in 60 quarterly installments commencing six months after the Termination Date. 

5.      Other Benefit Matters.      As a result of Employee s termination of employment, please note the following:

If Employee is enrolled in a Healthcare FSA, the COBRA notification will be mailed directly to Employee from Discovery Benefits.  If Employee wants to accept coverage, Employee must complete, sign and mail the application form to Discovery Benefits within 60 days of the Termination Date. 

401(k) Plan  .  Assuming it exceeds $5,000, Employee s account balance in Qorvo s 401(k) Plan may remain in such Plan or be transferred to another qualified plan or IRA at Employee s election.

In consideration of receiving the severance benefits described above, the Employee, for Employee s self, heirs, spouse, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, hereby knowingly and voluntarily releases Employer, its subsidiaries, affiliates, parents, predecessors and successors, and all officers, directors, agents and employees, and all persons, corporations, or other entities who might be claimed to be jointly or severally liable with it from any and all charges, complaints, grievances, causes of action, claims, and liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether actual or potential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected ( claims ), which Employee or anyone claiming by, through or under Employee may have or claim to have, and specifically but not exclusively, all claims regarding offenses that have occurred as of the date of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all claims relating to Employee s employment or termination from employment with Employer.

  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
    
  The following is a summary of compensation paid to the directors of Qorvo, Inc. (the  Company ) effective August 4, 2016.   
    
  Compensation of Non-Employee Directors 
    
  The Company maintains a non-employee director compensation program pursuant to which our non-employee directors are paid as follows: 

Annual cash retainer of $80,000 payable quarterly in arrears; 
                
    Additional annual retainer of $68,000 for the Non-Employee Chairman; 
                 
    Additional annual retainer for Committee Chairs: 
                o

  The annual restricted stock unit awards are granted on the date of the annual stockholders meeting at which directors are elected, or as soon as practicable thereafter. Newly elected non-employee directors appointed to the Board other than at an annual stockholders meeting would receive a pro rata annual restricted stock unit award based on the number of full months remaining until the first annual stockholders meeting following the director s initial appointment to the Board. Each award vests and becomes non-forfeitable as to 100% of the shares subject to the award on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the director s continued service from the date of grant until the vesting date. Directors may defer their annual restricted stock unit awards pursuant to the Qorvo, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. 
    
  Directors may defer all or a portion of their cash retainers by participating in our Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.  
    
  Directors are eligible to participate in our group medical and dental plans. 
    
  Directors are reimbursed for customary expenses for attending Board and committee meetings. 
    
  Compensation of Directors who are Employees of the Company
