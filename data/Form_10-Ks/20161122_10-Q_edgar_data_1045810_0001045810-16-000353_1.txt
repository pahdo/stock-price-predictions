Note 1   - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The   January 31, 2016   consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016  , as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016  .    
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  For a description of significant accounting policies, see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016  . There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Fiscal Year 
    
  We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year   2017   is a 52-week year and fiscal year   2016   was a 53-week year. The   third   quarter of fiscal years   2017   and   2016   were both 13-week quarters. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update which simplifies certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting. Among other elements, the new guidance eliminates additional paid in capital, or APIC, pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The new standard is effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of February 1, 2016.  
    
  Early adoption of this guidance resulted in the following: 

We recorded excess tax benefits within income tax expense, rather than in APIC, of   $12 million  ,   $8 million   and   $42 million   for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal year 2017, respectively. 

We recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of February 1, 2016 to increase retained earnings by   $353 million  , with a corresponding increase to deferred tax assets, to recognize the net operating loss and federal research tax credit carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation that had not been previously recognized in APIC. 

The excess tax benefits are now included in net operating cash rather than net financing cash in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We elected to apply this change in presentation prospectively and thus prior periods have not been adjusted. 
       
  We elected not to change our policy on accounting for forfeitures, although the new guidance provides an option for us to account for forfeitures as they occur, and thus continued to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.  
    
  The adoption of this new guidance impacted our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal year 2017 as follows:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months. The update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. Under existing guidance, operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  The FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries, effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019, although we are permitted to adopt the standard one year earlier. We will adopt this guidance either by using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption, or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply. 

Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.  
    
  Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized as inventory, as follows:

Equity Award Activity 
    
  The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: 

(1) 
    Includes PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest if the corporate financial performance maximum target level for fiscal year 2017 is achieved. Depending on the actual level of achievement of the corporate performance target at the end of fiscal year 2017, the PSUs issued could range from   0   to   2 million   shares. 
       
           (2) 
    Includes market-based PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum target for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to the respective TSRs of the companies comprising the Standard   Poor s 500 Index during a 3-year measurement period, the market-based PSUs issued could range from   0   to   0.3 million   shares. 
     Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the three and nine months ended October 30, 2016, the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was   $72 million   and   $89 million  , respectively. Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015, the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was   $34 million   and   $43 million  , respectively. 
    
  The following summarizes the aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense and estimated weighted average amortization period as of   October 30, 2016   and   January 31, 2016  :

Note 3   Net Income Per Share 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: 

(1) 
    Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares. 
       
           (2) 
    Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. 
       
  The   1.00%   Convertible Senior Notes, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of   $20.0780   per share. The Warrants outstanding are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Warrants have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of   $27.0281   per share. For the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , our average stock price was   $63.83   and   $47.82  , respectively, which exceeded both the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted strike price, causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a dilutive impact for these periods. 
    
  The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transactions, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Convertible Notes, the shares delivered to us under the Note Hedges will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Convertible Notes. Please refer to    Note 11    of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes.

Note 4     Income Taxes 
    
  We recognized income tax expense of   $79 million   and   $168 million   for the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $83 million   for the nine months ended   October 25, 2015  . We recognized income tax benefit of   $1 million   for the three months ended   October 25, 2015  . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was   12.8%   and   14.2%   for the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , respectively, and   16.9%   for the   nine months ended     October 25, 2015  . Income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was   0.5%   for the three months ended   October 25, 2015  . Our income tax expense includes   $42 million   and   $62 million   of tax benefit for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2016, respectively, from the early adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. Please refer to    Note    1 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  The increase in our effective tax rate in the three months ended   October 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the absence of the tax benefit related to the restructuring associated with the wind-down of our Icera operations. The decrease in our effective tax rate in the nine months ended October 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, which was permanently enacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, and our early adoption of an accounting standard, partially offset by the absence of the Icera restructuring tax benefit and an increase in the amount of our earnings subject to U.S. tax. 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     October 30, 2016   of   14.2%   was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, as well as tax benefits recognized in the period in which they occur for early adoption of an accounting standard and expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016  , other than the closure of our state income tax position in the three months ended July 31, 2016 and the aforementioned recognition of tax benefits upon the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in the   nine months ended     October 30, 2016  . 
    
  While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of   October 30, 2016  , we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Note 5 - Marketable Securities 
    
  All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as  available-for-sale  securities. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders  equity, net of tax, and net realized gains and losses recorded in other income and expense, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of   October 30, 2016  . Based on our quarterly impairment review, we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of   October 30, 2016  .   
    
  The following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of   October 30, 2016   and   January 31, 2016  :  

The following table provides the breakdown of the investments with unrealized losses as of   October 30, 2016  :  

The gross unrealized losses as of   October 30, 2016   related to fixed income securities due to changes in interest rates and are temporary in nature. We have the intent and ability to hold our investments with impairment indicators until maturity. 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities, which are primarily debt instruments, are classified as available-for-sale as of   October 30, 2016   and   January 31, 2016   and are shown below by contractual maturity:   

Net realized gains and losses were not significant for the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016   and   October 25, 2015  .

Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  In August 2015 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building that entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates. The objective of this interest rate swap is to mitigate variability in the benchmark interest rate on the first   $200 million   of existing operating lease financing payments. This interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge, will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, and will terminate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gains or losses on this swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and will subsequently be recorded in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occur. 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of   $64 million   and   $160 million  , respectively, to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts as of   October 30, 2016   was not significant. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended   October 30, 2016  , we also entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of   $54 million   and   $67 million  , respectively, to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency. These foreign currency forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income or expense, net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense, net. 
    
    Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts, we are allowed to net settle transactions with the same counterparty, subject to applicable requirements. However, we present our derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. 
    
  As of   October 30, 2016  , the maturities of the designated foreign currency forward contracts were three months or less. 
    
  We formally assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment are highly effective. For the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , all derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment were determined to be highly effective and there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness. 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , we recognized a net change in unrealized gains (losses) on derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment of   $2 million   and   $(3) million  , respectively, net of tax, in other comprehensive income. 
    
  We expect to realize all gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months. However, we do not expect to reclassify any amount from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss into earnings related to the interest rate swap as the underlying operating lease financing payments for our new headquarters building will not start within the next twelve months.

Note 10 - Guarantees 
    
  U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of the changes of the entity s product warranty liabilities. 
     
  Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities 
    
  We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  
    
  On July 31, 2015, we announced a voluntary recall and replacement of our SHIELD 8-inch tablets that were sold between July 2014 and July 2015. We have determined that the battery in these tablets can overheat, posing a fire hazard. The recall does not affect any other NVIDIA products. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2016, we recorded a   $26 million   charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and other associated costs. 
    
  The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities as of and for the nine and twelve months ended   October 30, 2016   and   January 31, 2016   were as follows:  

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered into in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Note 11 - Debt 
  Convertible Debt 
  1.00 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 
  On December 2, 2013, we issued   $1.50 billion   of 1.00% convertible senior notes, or the Convertible Notes, due 2018. The Convertible Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually at a rate of   1.00%   per annum. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date. The Convertible Notes were initially convertible at a rate of   49.5958   shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of   $20.1630   per share of common stock). The conversion rate and conversion price are adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including our cash dividends or distributions exceeding   $0.085   per share. Accordingly, as of   October 30, 2016  , the conversion rate has been adjusted to   49.8058   shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of   $20.0780   per share of common stock) for dividend increases. 
    
  We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes at issuance and the value assigned to the debt component was the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value represented the value assigned to the equity component and was recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method from the origination date through its stated contractual maturity date. 
    
  The initial debt component of the Convertible Notes was valued at   $1.35 billion   based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate for a non-convertible debt at the date of issuance, which was determined to be   3.15%  . The initial carrying value of the permanent equity component reported in additional paid-in-capital was valued at   $126 million   and recorded as a debt discount. This amount, together with the   $23 million   purchaser's discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, represented the total unamortized debt discount of   $148 million   we recorded at the time of issuance of the Convertible Notes. The aggregate debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method using an interest rate of   3.15%  . 
    
  The following table presents the carrying value of the Convertible Notes: 

(1) As of   October 30, 2016  , the remaining period over which the unamortized debt discount will be amortized is   2.1   years.

Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after August 1, 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions.    
    
  The Convertible Notes first became convertible as of February 1, 2016. As of October 30, 2016, the Convertible Notes continued to be convertible at the holders  option through January 29, 2017 as the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to   130%   of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our fiscal quarter ended October 30, 2016. As such, the   $1,011 million   carrying value of the Convertible Notes continued to be classified as a current liability and the   $45 million   difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes continued to be classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, and will remain there for as long as the Convertible Notes are convertible. The determination of whether or not the Convertible Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis. Consequently, the Convertible Notes may be reclassified as long-term debt and the convertible debt conversion obligation may be reclassified within shareholders' equity if the conversion threshold is not met in future quarters. 
    
  Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We may pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. Based on the closing price of our common stock on   October 28, 2016   (the last trading day of the third quarter of fiscal year 2017) of   $70.56  , the if-converted value of our Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately   $2.66 billion  . 
    
  During both the three and nine months ended October 30, 2016, we paid cash to settle   $444 million   in principal amount, issued   15 million   shares of our common stock with respect to the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount, and recognized a loss of   $15 million   on early conversions, of the Convertible Notes. Further, we received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of   $229 million   in principal amount of the Convertible Notes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Settlements of these conversion requests are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
    
  Note Hedges and Warrants 
    
  Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction, or the Note Hedges, with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes, or   $20.1630   per share. Adjusting for dividends paid through October 30, 2016, the strike price of the Note Hedges has been adjusted to   $20.0780   per share. The Note Hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. Through October 30, 2016, we had received   15 million   shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of an aggregate of   $444 million   in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. 
    
  In addition, concurrent with the offering of the Convertible Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges, we entered into a separate warrant transaction, or the Warrants, with an initial strike price to the holders of the Warrants of   $27.1425   per share. Under the terms of the Warrants, the strike price is adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including our cash dividends or distributions that deviate from $0.085 per share. Accordingly, as of October 30, 2016, the strike price was adjusted to   $27.0281   per share, reflecting adjustments for our dividend increases made to that date. The Warrants are net share settled and cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments,   75 million   shares of our common stock. As of October 30, 2016, the Warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding. The value of the Warrants was initially recorded in equity and continues to be classified as equity.

Long-Term Debt 
  2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 
  On September 16, 2016, we issued   $1.00 billion   of   2.20%   notes due September 16, 2021 and   $1.00 billion   of   3.20%   notes due September 16, 2026 (collectively, the Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. 
  The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes. 
    
  The net proceeds from the Notes were   $1.99 billion  , after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Notes to prefund the repayment of the principal amount of our Convertible Notes and for general corporate purposes such as dividend payments or share repurchases. 
  The carrying value of our long-term debt and the associated interest rates were as follows: 

Revolving Credit Facility 
  On October 7, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to   $575 million  , for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021, on which all outstanding obligations would be due and payable. The Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments up to   $425 million  , subject to certain conditions. As of October 30, 2016, we had not borrowed any amounts under the Credit Agreement.

  Operating Lease Financing Arrangement 
    
  In fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are financing this construction under an off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease arrangement. As a part of this arrangement, we leased the real property we own where the building will be constructed under a   99   year ground lease to a syndicate of banks and concurrently leased back the building under a real property lease. 
    
  Under the real property lease, we pay rent, taxes, maintenance costs, utilities, insurance and other property related costs. The lease has an initial   7.5   year term expiring on December 19, 2022, consisting of an approximately   2.5   year construction period followed by a   5   year lease term. We have the option to renew this lease for up to   three   additional   5   year periods, subject to approval by the banks. 
    
  We will oversee the construction of the headquarters building. The banks have committed to fund up to   $380 million   of costs relating to construction. Advances will be made periodically to reimburse us for construction costs we incur. Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction, we will pay rent in the form of interest. We have guaranteed the obligations under the lease held by our subsidiary. 
    
  During the term of the lease, we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks  investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent. At the end of the lease term, we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than   87.5%   of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building. However, under certain default circumstances, the lease guarantee may be 100% of the banks  investment in the building plus any and all accrued but unpaid interest and all other rent due and payable under the operative agreements. 
    
  The operative agreements are subject to customary default provisions, including, for example, those relating to payment and performance defaults, and events of bankruptcy. We are also subject to financial covenants including a covenant to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio not to exceed   3.0   to   1.0   and a minimum interest coverage ratio in excess of   3.5   to   1.0   during the term. If certain events of default occur and are continuing under the operative agreements, the banks may accelerate repayment of their investment under the lease. 
    
  Patent Infringement Cases 
    
  In September 2014, NVIDIA filed complaints against Qualcomm, Inc. and various Samsung entities in both the United States International Trade Commission, or ITC, and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of certain patents relating to graphics processing. In November 2014, Samsung filed complaints against NVIDIA in the ITC and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that NVIDIA infringed certain patents. 
    
  NVIDIA and Samsung, and NVIDIA and Qualcomm, also challenged the validity of certain of each other s patents through inter partes review before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 
    
  On April 28, 2016, NVIDIA and Samsung entered a binding memorandum of understanding which resolved all existing intellectual property disputes between the parties, and requires the immediate dismissal of all pending litigation between them. As a result of this agreement, on May 5, 2016, Samsung filed a Stipulation of Dismissal in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On May 11, 2016, NVIDIA voluntarily dismissed its petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review the ITC s decision in Investigation No. 337-TA-932. On May 12, 2016, NVIDIA voluntarily dismissed its Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On May 19, 2016, Samsung filed a Corrected Joint Motion to Terminate Investigation No. 337-TA-941. On June 16, 2016, the ITC granted the joint motion and terminated the ITC investigation. The parties have also moved to dismiss all pending inter partes reviews. Also as part of this agreement, NVIDIA and Samsung each received a license to a small number of patents of the other, but no portfolio license was granted nor was any compensation paid by either party. On June 28, 2016, NVIDIA and Samsung executed a settlement agreement based on the April 28, 2016 memorandum of understanding.

  In December 2015, Advanced Silicon Technologies LLC filed complaints in the ITC and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of certain patents relating to graphics processing and memory management. NVIDIA and Advanced Silicon Technologies resolved this litigation on April 22, 2016 and NVIDIA agreed to license the patents asserted and other patents owned and controlled by Advanced Silicon Technologies and certain of its affiliates. On April 27, 2016, NVIDIA and Advanced Silicon Technologies jointly moved to terminate the investigation as to NVIDIA. The Office of Unfair Import Investigations supported the motion, and none of the other parties opposed it. On May 10, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Determination granting the joint request to terminate the investigation as to NVIDIA. On June 1, 2016, the ITC issued a Notice determining not to review the Administrative Law Judge s determination, thereby finalizing termination of the investigation as to NVIDIA. Pursuant to the license agreement,   $10 million   was recorded as a charge to cost of revenue during the three months ended May 1, 2016.

Note 13 - Shareholders  Equity 
    
  Capital Return Program    
    
  Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. On November 7, 2016, the Board authorized an additional   $2.00 billion   under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020. 
    
  In March 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement with an investment bank, under which we made an upfront payment of   $500 million   to purchase shares of our common stock and received an initial delivery of   12 million   shares. The shares delivered resulted in a reduction, on the delivery date, of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. The ASR agreement was settled in July 2016 with a cash payment of   $9 million   to the investment bank. As a result, a total of   12 million   shares were repurchased under the ASR transaction for   $509 million  , or an average price of   $42.06   per share.  
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , we also paid   $61 million   and   $185 million  , respectively, in cash dividends to our shareholders, equivalent to   $0.1150   per share. As a result, we returned   $61 million   and   $694 million   to shareholders during the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , respectively, in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.   
    
  Through   October 30, 2016  , we have repurchased an aggregate of   243 million   shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of   $4.36 billion  . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of November 7, 2016, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to   $2.96 billion   through December 2020. 
    
  We intend to return   $1.00 billion   to our shareholders in fiscal year 2017 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return   $1.25 billion   to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We also declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to   $0.14   per share from   $0.1150   per share, to be paid with our next quarterly cash dividend on December 19, 2016, to all shareholders of record on November 28, 2016.

Note 14 - Segment Information 
    
  Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.    
    
  We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a unified underlying graphics architecture.    
    
  Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers and data scientists focused on artificial intelligence and big-data analytics; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.   Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, incorporating GPUs and multi-core CPUs aimed at online gaming and entertainment devices, as well as autonomous robots, drones and cars.    
    
  We have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors. This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. 
    
  The  All Other  category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other charges, contributions, product warranty charge, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.    
    
  Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.   The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the  All Other  category.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges 
    
  Third   Quarter of Fiscal Year 2017 Summary 

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 increased 54% year over year and 40% sequentially to $2.00 billion. Growth from a year ago was driven by gaming, datacenter, professional visualization, and automotive systems. GPU business revenue was $1.70 billion, up 53% from a year earlier and up 42% sequentially, led by growth in GeForce gaming GPUs and datacenter. GeForce gaming GPU revenue was fueled by strong adoption of our recent Pascal architecture. Datacenter revenue (including Tesla, NVIDIA GRID and NVIDIA DGX-1) was $240 million, up 193% from a year earlier and up 59% sequentially. This reflects strong demand for deep learning and high performance computing, Tesla and GRID for cloud and virtualized computing, and initial DGX-1 sales. Tegra business revenue, which included gaming development platforms and services, was $241 million, up 87% from a year earlier and up 45% sequentially. Also included was automotive revenue of $127 million, primarily from infotainment modules, which was up 61% from a year earlier and up 7% sequentially.  
    
  Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 was 59.0%, reflecting the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning. 
    
  Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $544 million, up 11% from a year earlier and up 7% sequentially. This reflects headcount related costs for our growth initiatives, as well as investments in sales and marketing. 
    
  Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $639 million, up 161% from a year earlier and up 102% sequentially. Net income and net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $542 million and $0.83, respectively, up 120% and 89%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting. This accounting standard requires adjustments to be reflected beginning in fiscal year 2017, including all fiscal quarters within the year. Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
    
  During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we paid $509 million for share repurchases and $185 million in cash dividends.  As a result, we have returned an aggregate of $694 million to shareholders in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. Our board of directors has authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our stock repurchase program for a total of $2.96 billion available through the end of December 2020. 
    
  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $6.67 billion as of October 30, 2016, compared with $4.88 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily related to cash received from our issuance of $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026 (collectively, the Notes) during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. 

Revenue 
    
  NVIDIA s products and services are built for three computing platforms - PC, Datacenter/Cloud, and Mobile. For the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, approximately   73%   and   77%   of our revenue, respectively, was associated with the PC computing platform, of which GPUs for the gaming and professional visualization markets comprised approximately   92%   and   87%  , respectively, while PC OEM represented approximately   8%   and   13%  , respectively. 
    
  Revenue by Reportable Segments 

GPU Business  . GPU business revenue increased by   53%   for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. This increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming, which increased 59%, reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and strong demand for our recent Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX-1, increased 193%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training, Tesla and GRID for cloud and virtualized computing, and initial DGX-1 sales. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 9% due primarily to higher sales in both desktop and mobile workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year. 

31 

GPU business revenue increased by   32%   in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. This increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming, which increased 36%, reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and strong demand for our recent Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla and NVIDIA GRID and DGX-1, increased 120%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training, Tesla and GRID for cloud and virtualized computing, and initial DGX-1 sales. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 11% due primarily to higher sales in both desktop and mobile workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year. 
    
  Tegra Processor Business.   Tegra Processor business revenue increased by   87%   for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by an increase of 61% in sales of Tegra products serving automotive systems and an increase in gaming development platforms and services compared to last year. 
    
  Tegra Processor business revenue increased by   41%   in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by an increase of 58% in sales of Tegra products serving automotive systems compared to last year. 
    
  All Other.   We recognized   $66 million   in revenue during the third quarter of both fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and   $198 million   in revenue during the first nine months of both fiscal years 2017 and 2016, from the patent cross licensing arrangement with Intel. 
    
  Concentration of Revenue  
    
  Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for   78%     of total revenue for both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 80% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and 78% of total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. 
    
  Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue for the respective dates, is summarized as follows: 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
    
  Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with operations. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. 
  Our overall gross margin was   59.0%   and   56.3%   for the   third   quarter of   fiscal years 2017 and 2016  , respectively, and   58.3%     and   56.0%   for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively. These increases were driven primarily by product mix in our GPU business, partially offset by lower gross margins in our Tegra business. 
  Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $13 million and $40 million for the   third   quarter of   fiscal years 2017 and 2016  , respectively, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 0.7% and 3.1%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $19 million and $6 million for the   third   quarter of   fiscal years 2017 and 2016  , respectively, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions and sales of items previously written-off or written-down was a 0.2% favorable impact for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a 2.6% unfavorable impact for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. 

32 

Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $40 million and $71 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 0.9% and 2.0%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $39 million and $26 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions and sales of items previously written-off or written-down was a 0.1% unfavorable impact for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 and a 1.3% unfavorable impact for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. 
    
  A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: 
    
  GPU Business  . The gross margin of our GPU business increased during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2016. GPU margins increased primarily due to strong demand for Tesla products for deep learning and high performance computing and the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs. 
      
  Tegra Processor Business  . The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2016. The increase in Tegra margins was primarily due to the inventory provisions we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 related primarily to older generation Tegra products and the warranty charge we recorded during the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 associated with the SHIELD tablet product recall. 
    
  Operating Expenses    

Research and Development 
    
  Research and development expenses increased by   13%   during the   third quarter   of   fiscal year 2017   compared to the   third quarter   of   fiscal year 2016  . Compensation and benefits increased by $38 million primarily driven by employee additions and an increase in related compensation and benefit costs, including stock-based compensation expense. 
    
  Research and development expenses increased by   8%   during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. Compensation and benefits increased by $68 million primarily driven by employee additions and an increase in related compensation and benefit costs, including stock-based compensation expense. 

33 

Sales, General and Administrative 
    
  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by   13%   during the   third quarter   of   fiscal year 2017   compared to the   third quarter   of   fiscal year 2016  . Compensation and benefits increased by $28 million primarily driven by employee additions and an increase in related compensation and benefit costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in outside professional fees of $16 million resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm. 
    
  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by   10%   during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. Compensation and benefits increased by $65 million primarily driven by employee additions and an increase in related compensation and benefit costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Marketing expense increased by $10 million mainly due to the introduction of our new Pascal family of GPUs. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in outside professional fees of $42 million resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm. 
    
  Restructuring and Other Charges 
    
  In the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we began the wind-down of our Icera operations. Our operating expenses for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 included $3 million of restructuring and other charges. No restructuring charges were recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
    
  Interest Income and Interest Expense 
    
  Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018, or the Convertible Notes, issued in December 2013 and the Notes issued in September 2016.  
    
  Interest income was $14 million and $9 million during the   third   quarter of   fiscal years 2017 and 2016  , respectively, and $37 million and $28 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities, as well as higher purchased yields.  
    
  Interest expense was $16 million and $12 million during the   third   quarter of   fiscal years 2017 and 2016  , respectively, and $39 million and $35 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, consisting primarily of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013 and the Notes issued in September 2016. 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
    
  Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early debt conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other expense, net, was $16 million and $19 million during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017 consisting primarily of $15 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Other income (expense), net, was not significant during the third quarter or the first nine months of fiscal year 2016.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We recognized income tax expense of $79 million and $168 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017, respectively, and $83 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. We recognized income tax benefit of $1 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 12.8% and 14.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017, respectively, and was 16.9% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. Income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.5% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our income tax expense includes $42 million and $62 million of tax benefit for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017, respectively, from the early adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. Please refer to    Note    1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

34 

The increase in our effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the absence of the tax benefit related to the restructuring associated with the wind-down of our Icera operations. The decrease in our effective tax rate in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, which was permanently enacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, and early adoption of an accounting standard, partially offset by the absence of the Icera restructuring tax benefit and an increase in the amount of our earnings subject to U.S. tax. 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 of 14.2% was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, as well as tax benefits recognized in the period in which they occur for early adoption of an accounting standard and expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
    
  Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

As of   October 30, 2016  , we had   $6.67 billion   in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $1.63 billion from the end of fiscal year 2016. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions. Our portfolio managers are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset types, and certain limits on our portfolio duration. 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year   2017   compared to the first nine months of fiscal year   2016  , primarily due to higher net income resulting from revenue growing at a faster rate than operating expenses and gross margin improvements.  
    
  Cash used by investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year   2017   compared to the first nine months of fiscal year   2016  , primarily due to higher purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment and intangible assets than proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. 
    
  Cash was provided by financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, primarily due to the $2.00 billion of Notes we issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, partially offset by $444 million of repayments of convertible debt and $694 million of share repurchases and dividend payments. Cash was used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal year   2016  , primarily due to $604 million of share repurchases and dividend payments. 

35 

Liquidity 
    
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations. Our investment portfolio consists principally of cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt securities, debt securities of United States government agencies, debt securities issued by United States Treasury, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprises, foreign government bonds and money market funds. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. As of   October 30, 2016  , we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. 
    
  Please refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  As of   October 30, 2016   and   January 31, 2016  , we had   $6.67 billion   and   $5.04 billion  , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities and the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. As of   October 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our investment policy. As of   October 30, 2016  , our investments in government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises represented 39% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for 25% of our total investment portfolio.  All of our investments are in A/A3 or better rated securities. 
  Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States. Most of the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States. However, if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the United States, we would incur U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 35% less utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards, and further offset by any applicable research and foreign tax credits, plus any state income taxes on such income. Repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws. 
  Dividend payments and any share repurchases must be made from cash held in the United States. In the   third quarter   and first nine months of fiscal year   2017  , we made total cash dividend payments of   $61 million   and   $185 million  , respectively, and repurchased   $509 million   of our common stock in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, utilizing a significant amount of our U.S. cash balance previously taxed as of   October 30, 2016  . We did not enter into any structured share repurchase transactions during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  Convertible Notes  
    
  On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes and concurrently entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date. The Convertible Notes were convertible during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 and are currently convertible at the holders  option in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we paid cash to settle $444 million in principal amount, issued 15 million shares of our common stock with respect to the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount, and recognized a loss of $15 million on early conversions, of the Convertible Notes. We have received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $229 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Settlements of these conversion requests are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
    
  Given the current price of our common stock, we expect to receive additional notices of early conversion, which could require us to use a substantial amount of our cash in the United States to settle. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 
  On September 16, 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Notes to prefund the repayment of the principal amount of our Convertible Notes and for general corporate purposes such as dividend payments or share repurchases. 

36 

Revolving Credit Facility 
  On October 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575 million, for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021, on which date all outstanding obligations would be due and payable. The Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments and/or commitments to issue letters of credit of up to $425 million, subject to certain conditions. As of October 30, 2016, we had not borrowed any amounts under the Credit Agreement.  
    
  Capital Return to Shareholders 
    
  In March 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement with an investment bank, under which we made an upfront payment of   $500 million   to purchase shares of our common stock and received an initial delivery of   12 million   shares. The shares delivered resulted in a reduction, on the delivery date, of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. The ASR agreement was settled in July 2016 with a cash payment of   $9 million   to the investment bank. As a result, a total of   12 million   shares were repurchased under the ASR transaction for   $509 million  , or an average price of   $42.06   per share.  
    
  During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we also paid   $61 million   and   $185 million  , respectively, in cash dividends to our shareholders, equivalent to   $0.1150   per share. As a result, we returned   $61 million   and   $694 million   to shareholders during the   three and nine months ended     October 30, 2016  , respectively, in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.  
    
  We intend to return   $1.00 billion   to our shareholders in fiscal year 2017 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. On November 7, 2016, the Board authorized an additional   $2.00 billion   under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020. We also declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.1400 per share from   $0.1150   per share, to be paid with our next quarterly cash dividend on December 19, 2016, to all shareholders of record on November 28, 2016. 
    
  Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. 
    
  Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements 
    
  We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  During fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. We are financing this construction under an off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease arrangement. The banks have committed to fund up to $380 million of costs relating to construction. Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction, we will pay rent in the form of interest. The lease has an initial 7.5 year term expiring on December 19, 2022, consisting of an approximately 2.5 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term. We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods, subject to approval by the banks. During the term of the lease, we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks  investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent. At the end of the lease term, we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 87.5% of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building. Please refer to    Note 12    of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our operating lease financing arrangement. 
  
    37 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  As of   October 30, 2016  , we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling   $908 million  . Except as described above with respect to the Convertible Notes and the Notes, there were no other material changes in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016  . 
    
  Please see Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016   for a description of our contractual obligations. 

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Please see Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Investment and Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of   October 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to the financial market risks described as of   January 31, 2016  . 
    
  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk    
    
  During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. 
    
  During the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2017, we also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency. The change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income or expense, net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense, net. 
    
  Please see Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Based on their evaluation as of   October 30, 2016  , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  None. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  Please refer to the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016  . There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016   with the exception of the risks identified below. 
    
  Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016   and any additional risks set forth below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. 
    
  We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. 
    
  In December 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026. In October 2016, we also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575 million. We may obtain additional revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. While the facility is currently undrawn, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. 
    
  Additionally, our obligation to make payments related to the Convertible Notes when converted or due, or related to the Notes when due, could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes. 
    
  The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, dilute our net income per share and the exercise of the Warrants would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. 
    
  When the average trading price of our common stock for a fiscal quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of the Warrants, the number of diluted weighted average shares used in our net income per share calculation increases, which dilutes our net income per share. For example, our average trading price for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2017 was $46.57 and   $63.83  , respectively, which contributed approximately 31 million and   43 million   weighted average shares, respectively, to our net income per share calculation. 
    
  The Warrants will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between March 2019 and June 2019, unless the Warrant holder notifies us otherwise. Any issuance by us of shares upon exercise or any other settlement of the Warrants may dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. 

40 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. On November 7, 2016, the Board authorized an additional   $2.00 billion   under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020. 
    
  Through   October 30, 2016  , we have repurchased an aggregate of   243 million   shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of   $4.36 billion  . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of November 7, 2016, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to   $2.96 billion   through December 2020. We intend to return   $1.00 billion   to our shareholders in fiscal year 2017 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.  
    
  The repurchases will be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement. 
    
  Transactions Related to our Convertible Notes and Note Hedges 
    
  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we issued an aggregate of   15 million   shares of our common stock upon settlement of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an  affiliated purchaser  and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option.  
    
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we expect to settle at least an aggregate of   $229 million   in principal amount, and issue shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value, related to the Convertible Notes that were submitted for conversion. The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes. We expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note Hedges. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges. 
    
  Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding 
    
  We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive program. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we withheld approximately   5 million   shares at a total cost of   $176 million   through net share settlements. Please refer to    Note 2    of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.
