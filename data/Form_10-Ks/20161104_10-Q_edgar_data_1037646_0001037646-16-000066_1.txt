1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Mettler-Toledo International Inc. ("Mettler-Toledo" or the "Company") is a leading global supplier of precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, packaging, logistics and food retailing applications.  The Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development.  In addition, the Company manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging and provides solutions for use in certain process analytics applications.  The Company's primary manufacturing facilities are located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  The Company's principal executive offices are located in Columbus, Ohio and Greifensee, Switzerland. 
  The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and include all entities in which the Company has control, which are its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented. Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.  A discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 
   
           2. 
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     Trade Accounts Receivable 
  Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s best estimate of probable credit losses in its existing trade accounts receivable.  The Company determines the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio.

Inventories 
  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing.  Adjustments to the cost basis of the Company s inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required. 
  Inventories consisted of the following:   

  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.  
  Other intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets and assets subject to amortization.  Where applicable, amortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company assesses the initial acquisition of intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805 "Business Combinations" and the continued accounting for previously recognized intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 "Intangible - Goodwill and Other" and ASC 360 "Property, Plant and Equipment".  
  Other intangible assets consisted of the following:

The Company recognized amortization expense associated with the above intangible assets of   $2.2 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $5.8 million   and   $4.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The annual aggregate amortization expense based on the current balance of other intangible assets is estimated at   $8.2 million   for   2016  ,   $9.8 million   for   2017  ,   $9.4 million   for   2018  ,   $9.0 million   for   2019  ,   $8.7 million   for   2020   and   $8.1 million   for   2021  .  Purchased intangible amortization was   $2.0 million  ,   $1.3 million   after tax, and   $1.3 million  ,   $0.9 million   after tax, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $5.2 million  ,   $3.5 million   after tax, and   $4.2 million  ,   $2.9 million   after tax, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In addition to the above amortization, the Company recorded amortization expense associated with capitalized software of   $6.8 million   and   $6.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $20.2 million   and   $18.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled. Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most countries and, accordingly, title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment. In countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery, the Company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. The Company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented. Other than a few small software applications, the Company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument. The Company s products typically require no significant production, modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products. To the extent the Company s solutions have a post-shipment obligation, revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed. The Company defers product revenue where installation is required, unless such installation is deemed perfunctory. The Company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods and/or services.  These deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the Company's control.  The allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates, time to install and geographic location.   
  Further, certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer.  Revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to its distributors.  Distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized.  
  Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed. Spare parts sold on a stand-alone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment.  Revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period. These contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification and preventative maintenance on a customer s pre-defined equipment over the contract period.  Service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period. 
  Warranty 
  The Company generally offers   one  -year warranties on most of its products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized.  While the Company engages in extensive product quality

programs and processes, its warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates, material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. 
  Employee Termination Benefits 
  In situations where contractual termination benefits exist, the Company records accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable.  All other employee termination arrangements are recognized and measured at their fair value at the communication date unless the employee is required to render additional service beyond the legal notification period, in which case the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period.   
  Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.  The Company recorded   $3.6 million   and   $10.9 million   of share-based compensation expense for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $3.4 million   and   $10.3 million   for the corresponding periods in   2015  . 
  Research and Development 
  Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries, consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as incurred. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, to ASC 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 provides authoritative guidance clarifying the principles for recognizing revenue and developing a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosure to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the year beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and disclosures. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which amends ASU 2014-09. The ASU provides guidance for assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash considerations, and completed contract modifications at transition. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the year beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and disclosures. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which amends ASU 2014-09. The ASU provides guidance for identifying performance obligations as they pertain to immaterial promised goods or services, shipping and handling activities, and identifying when promises represent performance obligations. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the year beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows," which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively and becomes effective for the year beginning January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, to ASC 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation." The guidance allows for the simplification related to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, the accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance can be applied either on a retrospective or prospective basis and becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to ASC 842 "Leases." The accounting guidance primarily requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet as a right to use asset and a lease liability, with the exception of short term leases. A lessee will continue to recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis for leases classified as operating leases. The guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and must be applied on a retrospective basis with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
    In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, to ASC 740 "Income Taxes." The guidance simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax balances be presented as non-current. This change, which can be early adopted, conforms U.S. GAAP to IFRS. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the year beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance would have reduced current assets and increased non-current assets by approximately   $71.6 million   and reduced current liabilities and increased non-current liabilities by approximately   $22.9 million   on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, to ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements." ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize investments using the net asset value per share method within the fair value hierarchy. The Company will adopt the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016, which will have an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
   
           3. 
    ACQUISITIONS  
     In August 2016, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Henry Troemner, LLC, (Troemner) a supplier of lab equipment, weights and weight calibration based in the United States for an aggregate purchase price of   $95.8 million   that will be included into the Company's laboratory instrument offering. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled   $33.8 million  , which is included in the Company's U.S. Operations segment. The Company identified intangible assets which included customer relationships of   $43.9 million  , tradename of   $3.4 million  , technology and patents of   $2.9 million   and other intangibles of   $0.5 million  . The identifiable intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from   3   to   25   years and the annual aggregate amortization expense is estimated at   $2.7 million  . Net tangible assets acquired were   $11.3 million   and are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  
  In   2016  , the Company also incurred additional acquisitions payments totaling   $13.9 million  . Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions totaled   $5.8 million  . The Company also recorded   $7.7 million   of identified intangibles primarily pertaining to customer relationships in connection with these acquisitions, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over   10   to   15   years.

    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
     The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The amount of the Company's fixed obligation interest payments may change based upon the expiration dates of its interest rate swap agreements and the level and composition of its debt. The Company also enters into certain foreign currency forward contracts to limit the Company's exposure to currency fluctuations on the respective hedged items. As also mentioned in Note 7, the Company has designated its euro denominated debt as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign operations. For additional disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments, see Note 5.  
  Cash Flow Hedges  
  The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales denominated in euro with its Swiss-based business. In January 2015, prior to the Swiss National Bank's abandonment of its previously established exchange rate of   1.20   Swiss franc per euro, the Company increased the notional amount of the cash flow hedges to a total notional value and average forward rate of Euro   86 million   and   1.21   for contracts that matured in 2015 and Euro   67 million   and   1.19   for contracts that mature in 2016.  The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were   $23.1 million   (Euro   20.6 million  ) and   $73 million   (Euro   67 million  ) at December 31, 2015. The gross amount recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) during the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a loss of   $0.2 million   and a loss   $6.1 million  , respectively. The gross amount recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) during the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a loss of   $0.5 million   and a gain   $18.1 million  , respectively. 
  The Company has an interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge. The agreement is a swap which has the effect of changing the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments associated with   $50 million   in forecasted borrowings under the Company s credit facility to a fixed obligation of   2.52%  . The swap began in October 2015 and matures in October 2020.  
  In March 2015, the Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement.  The agreement will change the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments associated with   $100 million   in forecasted borrowings under the Company's credit agreement to a fixed obligation of   2.25%   beginning in February 2017 and matures in February 2022. 
  The Company's cash flow hedges are recorded gross at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts reclassified into other comprehensive income and the effective portions of the cash flow hedges are further disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. A derivative gain of   $0.5 million   based upon interest rates and foreign currency rates at   September 30, 2016  , is expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the next twelve months. Through   September 30, 2016  , no hedge ineffectiveness has occurred in relation to the cash flow hedges. 
  Other Derivatives 
  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to economically hedge short-term trade and non-trade intercompany balances largely denominated in Swiss franc, other major European currencies, and the Chinese Renminbi with its foreign businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these contracts are considered  derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on these instruments are reported in current earnings. The foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, and disclosed in Note 5. The amount recognized in other charges (income) during the three

months ended   September 30, 2016   was insignificant to the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized in other charges (income), a net gain of   $4.7 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and a net loss of   $0.7 million   and   $4.8 million   during the nine months months ended   September 30, 2016    and   2015  , respectively. The gains and losses are primarily offset by the underlying transaction gains and losses on the related intercompany balances. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, these contracts had a notional value of   $319.4 million   and   $318.7 million  , respectively.     
   
  5.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had derivative assets totaling   $2.8 million   and   $8.2 million  , respectively, and derivative liabilities totaling   $9.4 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively.  The fair values of the interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges and foreign currency forward contracts that economically hedge short-term intercompany balances are estimated based upon inputs from current valuation information obtained from dealer quotes and priced with observable market assumptions and appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company has evaluated the valuation methodologies used to develop the fair values by dealers in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price in the Company s principal market.  In addition, the Company uses an internally developed model to perform testing on the valuations received from brokers.  The Company has also considered both its own credit risk and counterparty credit risk in determining fair value and determined these adjustments were insignificant at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $19.6 million   and   $18.8 million   of cash equivalents, respectively, the fair value of which is determined through quoted and corroborated prices in active markets.  The fair value of cash equivalents approximates cost. 
  The fair value of the Company's fixed interest rate debt was estimated using Level 2 inputs, primarily discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company's debt exceeds the carrying value by approximately   $24.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of the Company's debt exceeds the fair value by approximately   $9.2 million   as of December 31, 2015.  
  Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  A fair value measurement consists of observable and unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
    
  A fair value hierarchy has been established that categorizes these inputs into three levels: 
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
              Level 2: 
    Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
              Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs

1.47%  Euro Senior Notes 
  The Company has designated the   1.47%   Euro Senior Notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign subsidiaries to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the net investment in these operations. Changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized gain (loss) recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to this net investment hedge was a loss of   $2.0 million   and a gain   $0.3 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a loss of   $3.6 million   and a gain   $0.3 million   for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances, borrowings and cash generated from operating activities. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity and other factors.  
  The Company has purchased   25.7 million   shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through   September 30, 2016  .

Item 2. 
     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
  General 
  Our interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  .  
  Changes in local currency exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates.  We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods.  We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results. 
  We also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results. 
  Results of Operations   Consolidated 
  The following tables set forth certain items from our interim consolidated statements of operations for the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands). 

Net sales  
  Net sales were   $650.6 million   and   $604.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.799 billion   and   $1.722 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . This represents an increase of   8%   and   4%   in U.S. dollars for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased   9%   and   6%   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1% to our net

Our net sales by geographic destination for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in local currencies increased in the Americas   7%   for both periods, in Europe   8%   and   4%  , and in Asia/Rest of World   11%   and   8%  , respectively. Excluding the Troemner acquisition, our local currency net sales growth in the Americas for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 6%. A discussion of sales by operating segment is included below.   
  As described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services.  Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, preventative maintenance and spare parts. 
  Net sales of products increased   8%   in U.S. dollars and   10%   in local currencies for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased   5%   in U.S. dollars and   6%   in local currencies for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  .

The local currency increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included strong growth in most product categories. The Troemner acquisition contributed approximately 2% to our net sales of laboratory-related products and related services for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Net sales of our industrial-related products and related services, which represented approximately   43%   of our total net sales increased   7%   in U.S. dollars and   8%   in local currencies for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased 2% in U.S. dollars and   5%   in local currencies for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The local currency increase in our net sales of our industrial-related products and related services for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included particularly strong sales growth in product inspection and solid sales growth in our core industrial-related products and related services. 
  Net sales in our food retailing products and related services, which represented approximately 9% of our total net sales increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased 4% in U.S. dollars and   6%   in local currencies for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The local currency increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included particularly strong growth and project activity in Europe, the Americas, and Asia/Rest of World.

  Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was   4.6%   and   4.9%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   5.0%   and 5.1% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Research and development expenses increased   3%   in U.S. dollars and increased   6%   in local currencies for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased   2%   in U.S. dollars and increased   5%   in local currencies for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   relating to the timing of research and development project activity. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were   28.8%   and 29.1% for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   30.3%   and 30.4% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased   6%   in U.S. dollars and   8%   in local currencies for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased   4%   in U.S. dollars and   6%   in local currencies for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The local currency increase includes higher cash incentive expense, investments in our field sales organization and acquisitions, offset in part by benefits from our cost savings programs. 
  Amortization, interest expense, other charges (income), net and taxes 
  Amortization expense was   $9.1 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $26.2 million   and   $22.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Interest expense was   $7.2 million   and $7.0 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $20.6 million   and   $20.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Other charges (income), net includes a one-time non-cash pension settlement charge of $8.2 million related to a lump sum offering to former employees of our U.S. pension plan. Other charges (income), net also includes (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activity, interest income, acquisition transaction costs and other items. 
    
  The provision for taxes is based upon using our projected annual effective tax rate of 24% before discrete items for the   three   and   nine   months periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed non-U.S. operations. The most significant of these lower-taxed operations are in Switzerland and China. 
    
  Results of Operations   by Operating Segment 
    
  The following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments.  We currently have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and Other.  A more detailed description of these segments is outlined in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015

U.S. Operations (amounts in thousands) 

Total net sales increased   7%   and   6%   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the corresponding periods in   2015  . Net sales to external customers increased   8%   and   7%   for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Net sales in our U.S. operations benefited approximately 2% and 1% from the Troemner acquisition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects strong sales growth in most product categories. The three month period includes particularly strong results in product inspection and food retailing project activity. 
  Segment profit increased   $3.2 million   and   $12.1 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , primarily due to increased sales and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives, offset in part by increased cash incentive expense and sales and service investments.  
  Swiss Operations (amounts in thousands) 

1) 
    Represents U.S. dollar growth (decline) for net sales and segment profit. 

Total net sales increased   3%   in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency for both the three  and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Net sales to external customers decreased   1%   in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currency for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and decreased   7%   in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The decrease in local currency net sales to external customers for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   primarily relates to soft market conditions in Switzerland. 
  Segment profit decreased   $2.5 million   and   $1.2 million   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The decrease in segment profit is due to lower currency hedging gains in the current year, offset by increased total net sales, benefits from our cost saving programs and reduced material costs.

Western European Operations (amounts in thousands) 

1) 
    Represents U.S. dollar growth (decline) for net sales and segment profit. 
       
  Total net sales increased   4%   in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currencies for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Net sales to external customers increased   6%   in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased   3%   in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Total net sales to external customers for the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes growth in most product categories, with particularly strong growth in food retailing project activity and strong growth in product inspection. Total net sales to external customers for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes strong growth in most laboratory-related products and related services offset in part by a decline in product inspection which faced a difficult prior year comparison. 
    
  Segment profit increased   $3.6 million   and   $5.3 million   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase in segment profit includes the impact of increased sales and benefits from our margin expansion and cost savings initiatives and favorable currency translation fluctuations, offset by increased sales and service investments. 
    
  Chinese Operations (amounts in thousands) 

1) 
    Represents U.S. dollar growth for net sales and segment profit. 
       
  Total net sales increased   5%   in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased   2%   in U.S. dollars and 8% local currency for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Net sales to external customers increased   3%   in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 7% local currency during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase in local currency net sales to external customers during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects strong growth in laboratory-related products and related services and modest growth in industrial-related products and related services. While we are pleased with our local currency sales growth in China, the outlook remains uncertain due to the risks in the Chinese economy. 
    
  Segment profit increased   $6.7 million   and   $14.7 million   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase in segment profit for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes increased local currency sales and benefits from our cost savings initiatives.

    Represents U.S. dollar growth for net sales and segment profit. 
       
  Total net sales increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 12% local currency for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Net sales to external customers increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 12% local currency during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The local currency increase in total net sales and net sales to external customers includes strong growth in several countries.  
    
  Segment profit increased   $3.3 million   and   $8.4 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase in segment profit is primarily due to increased sales, offset in part by unfavorable currency translation fluctuations and increased sales and service investments. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments.  In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions.   
  Cash provided by operating activities totaled   $290.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $289.8 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . Cash provided by operating activity in 2016 includes increased net earnings and increased customer deposits of $16.0 million, offset by changes in accounts receivables of $21.4 million that are primarily related to timing and our increased local currency sales. 
  Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled   $51.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $56.8 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  .      
  We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. In August 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Henry Troemner, LLC, (Troemner) a supplier of lab equipment, weights and weight calibration based in the United States for an aggregate purchase price of $95.8 million that will be included into our laboratory instrument offering. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled $33.8 million, which is included in our U.S. Operations segment. We identified intangible assets which included customer relationships of $43.9 million, tradename of $3.4 million, technology and patents of $2.9 million and other intangibles of $0.5 million. The identifiable intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 25 years and the annual aggregate amortization expense is estimated at $2.7 million. Net tangible assets acquired were $11.3 million and are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  
  In   2016  , we also incurred additional acquisitions payments totaling $13.9 million. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions totaled   $5.8 million  . We also recorded   $7.7 million   of identified intangibles primarily pertaining to customer relationships in connection with these acquisitions, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 15 years.

We plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the United States will be any applicable withholding taxes.  All other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the United States where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.  Accordingly, we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity.   
    
  Senior Notes and Credit Facility Agreement 
    
  Our debt consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $457.0 million   was available under our Credit Agreement.  Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flows and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. 
    
  We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our credit facility and local working capital facilities, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  We have a share repurchase program of which there was   $1.1 billion   common shares remaining to be repurchased under the program as of   September 30, 2016  . The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and existing cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity and other factors.  
    
  We have purchased   25.7 million   shares since the inception of the program through   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we spent   $375.0 million   and   $371.2 million   on the repurchase of   1,048,075   shares and   1,167,796   shares at an average price per share of   $357.77   and   $317.86  , respectively.  We also reissued   193,517   shares and

     Table of Contents  

281,627   shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and issuance of restricted stock units during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   

Effect of Currency on Results of Operations 
  Our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are most sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally, and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down.  
    
  We entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce our exposure from the Swiss franc strengthening against the euro through 2016. The notional amount and average forward rate of our foreign currency forward contracts at   September 30, 2016   is Euro 20.6 million and 1.19 for contracts that mature in 2016. Absent these forward currency forward contracts, we estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $1.2 million to $1.4 million annually. We also estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $0.4 million to $0.6 million annually in addition to the previously mentioned strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro impact. 
  We also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese Renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese Renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $0.3 million to $0.5 million annually.  
  In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. Based on our outstanding debt at   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately $22.7 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.
