Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation   

Description
of Business   

SpectraScience,
Inc. was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on May 4, 1983 as GV Medical, Inc. In October 1992, GV Medical discontinued its
prior business, refocused its development efforts and changed its name to SpectraScience, Inc. The  Company,  hereinafter,
refers to SpectraScience, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Luma Imaging Corporation ( LUMA ), Spectra Science
International, Inc. ( International ) and SpectraScience (UK) Limited ( SpectraUK ). Since 1996, the Company
has focused primarily on developing the WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System (the  WavSTAT System ).  

The
Company has developed and received the European CE mark approval to market a proprietary, minimally invasive technology that optically
illuminates tissue in real-time to distinguish between normal, pre-cancerous or cancerous cells without the need to remove the
subject cell tissue from the body to make such determinations. The WavSTAT System operates by using cool, safe laser light to
optically illuminate and analyze tissue, enabling the physician to make an instant diagnosis during endoscopy when screening for
cancer, and if warranted, to begin immediate treatment during the same procedure. Beginning in December 2011, the WavSTAT 4 version
of the product began to be sold in the European Union for clinical trials related to colon cancer detection. In June 2012, the
Company entered into a distribution agreement with PENTAX Europe, GmbH.  

On
November 6, 2007, the Company acquired the assets of LUMA in an equity transaction accounted for as an acquisition of assets and
now operates LUMA as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. LUMA had acquired the assets from a predecessor company that had
developed, and received FDA approval for, a non-invasive diagnostic imaging system that can detect cervical cancer precursors
and which utilizes an underlying technology that is similar to that of the WavSTAT System. The addition of the LUMA technology
to the Company s existing WavSTAT System technology provides the Company with a broad suite of fluorescence-based intellectual
property and know-how. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Company wrote off the remaining fair value of the LUMA
inventory in order to focus on the continued development and marketing of the WavSTAT System. The Company retained the intellectual
property of LUMA for use in the development of future generations of the WavSTAT System.  

The
transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets that included intellectual property, inventory and equipment. The intellectual
property consisted of a total of 34 issued U.S. patents and 28 additional patent applications.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q as they are
prescribed for smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to make the financial statements not misleading
have been included. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and related notes, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

Going
Concern    

Historically,
the Company s sources of cash have come from the issuance and sale of equity securities and debentures. The Company s
historical cash outflows have been primarily used for operating activities including research, development, administrative and
sales activities. Fluctuations in the Company s working capital due to timing differences of its cash receipts and cash
disbursements also impact its cash flow. The Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses through at least
the end of 2016, as it completes proof-of-concept trials, conducts outcome-based clinical studies and increases sales and marketing
efforts to commercialize the WavSTAT4 System in Europe. If the Company does not receive sufficient funding, there is substantial
doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. The Company may incur unknown expenses or may not be able
to meet its revenue forecast, and one or more of these circumstances would require the Company to seek additional capital. The
Company may not be able to obtain equity capital or debt funding on terms that are acceptable. Even if the Company receives additional
funding, such proceeds may not be sufficient to allow the Company to sustain operations until it becomes profitable and begins
to generate positive cash flows from operations.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $10,503,770 and cash of $1,927, compared to a working capital
deficit of $8,324,600 and cash of $127,493 as of December 31, 2015. In December 2011, the Company entered into an Engagement Agreement
with Laidlaw   Company (UK) Ltd., which Engagement Agreement was amended in July 2012. Under the Engagement Agreement, Laidlaw
agreed to assist the Company in raising up to $20.0 million in capital over a two-year period from the date of the Engagement
Agreement. Subsequent to March 31, 2013, the Company has engaged other agents to assist the Company with raising capital and has
commenced raising capital on its own. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $1,185,000, net of transaction
costs of $34,000, under these agreements. However, if the Company does not receive additional funds in a timely manner, the Company
could be in jeopardy as a going concern. The Company may not be able to find alternative capital or raise capital or debt on terms
that are acceptable. Management believes that if the events defined in the Engagement Agreements occur as expected, or if the
Company is otherwise able to raise a similar level of funds, such proceeds will be sufficient to allow the Company to sustain
operations until it attains profitability and positive cash flows from operations. However, the Company may incur unknown expenses
or may not be able to meet its revenue expectations requiring it to seek additional capital. In such event, the Company may not
be able to find capital or raise capital or debt on terms that are acceptable.  

The
holders of Convertible Debentures control the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and certain of the Convertible Debentures
were not converted at their maturity constituting a potential default on the matured, but unconverted, Convertible Debentures.
In the event of such default, principal, accrued interest and other related costs are immediately due and payable in cash. As
of September 30, 2016, Convertible Debentures with a face value of $5,473,032 held by 75 individual investors are in default.
None of these investors have served notice of default on the Convertible Debentures held by them.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of the Company s products
is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the terms of which are generally free on board
shipping point. The Company uses customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. The Company uses shipping
documents and third-party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred. The Company assesses whether the price is fixed
or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction. To determine whether collection is probable,
the Company assesses a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the
customer.  

Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SpectraScience, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
LUMA, International and Spectra UK. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Risks
and Uncertainties   

The
Company operates in an industry that is subject to intense competition, government regulation and rapid technological change.
The Company s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological,
regulatory and other risks associated with a short history of product sales, including the potential risk of business failure.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Significant estimates made by management
include, among others, realization of long-lived assets including intangible assets, assumptions used to value stock options,
assumptions used to value the common stock issued and assumptions related to the determination of the fair value of the derivative
components associated with the Company s Convertible Debentures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Inventory
Valuation   

The
Company states its inventory at the lower of cost or market value, determined on a specific cost basis. The Company provides inventory
allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to obsolescence and reductions in estimated
future demand. The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing
technology and customer demand levels. Unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory
reserves that could adversely impact the Company s gross margins. Conversely, favorable changes in demand could result in
higher gross margins when the Company sells products.  

SpectraScience,
Inc.   

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)   

Valuation
of Long-lived Assets   

The
Company s long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets. Equipment is carried at cost and is
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally two to three years, and leasehold improvements
are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The straight-line method is
used for depreciation and amortization. Intangible assets consist of patents, which are amortized using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the patents. The Company does not capitalize external legal costs and filing fees associated
with obtaining patents on its new discoveries. Acquired intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated
useful life. The Company believes the useful lives assigned to these assets are reasonable. The Company assesses the recoverability
of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
These computations utilize judgments and assumptions inherent in management s estimate of future cash flows to determine
recoverability of these assets. If management s assumptions about these assets were to change as a result of events or circumstances,
the Company may be required to record an impairment loss.  

Variable
Conversion Rate Debentures   

Starting
in 2015, the Company entered into convertible debentures with floating exercise prices discounted to market prices. As a result,
a significant number of shares were either issued or may be issued at deeply discounted variable conversion prices. The downward
pressure placed on the Company s stock as a result of these conversions can be classified as  death spirals 
since the investors have no incentive to maintain a stable stock price. The Company accounts for these debentures as derivative
liabilities which means the debentures are revalued at the end of each period and gains and losses are recognized at the issuance
of the debentures and on the conversion of the debentures.  

Over
Commitment of Shares   

Since
the number of shares issuable under convertible debentures with floating exercise prices is undeterminable, the Company may be
required to issue shares in excess of the number of shares authorized by its shareholders. As a result, when the Company determines
that is does not have sufficient shares to meet the obligations of derivative unexercised debentures, warrants and options, the
derivatives must be valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing method and a liability is recorded as though the obligations
would be settled using some means other than stock.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation
 ( ASC 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards
made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based
awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model (the  Black-Scholes Model ). The value
of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using
the straight-line method. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises its estimate in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505-50,  Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees  ( ASC 505-50 ). Under ASC 505-50, the Company determines the fair value of the warrants
or stock-based compensation awards  

SpectraScience,
Inc.   

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)   

granted
as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable.  

All
issuances of stock options or other equity instruments to employees and non-employees as the consideration for goods or services
received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. Any stock options issued to
non-employees are recorded in expense and additional paid-in capital in shareholders  equity over the applicable service
periods using variable accounting through the vesting dates based on the fair value of the options at the end of each reporting
period.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had one stock-based employee compensation plan under which it makes grants, the 2011 Equity
Incentive Plan (the  EIP ). The EIP provides for the grant of incentive stock options ( ISOs ), nonqualified
stock options ( NQSOs ) and restricted stock awards to full-time employees (who may also be directors) and NQSOs and
restricted stock awards to non-employee directors, consultants, customers, vendors or providers of services. The exercise price
of any ISO may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and the term shall not exceed ten
years. The amount reserved under the 2011 EIP is 40,000,000 shares of common stock. At September 30, 2016, the Company had options
outstanding exercisable into up to 34,168,800 shares of stock under the EIP and the Company s prior Amended 2001 Stock Plan
of which up to 24,059,921 shares were exercisable. Awards under the Company s EIP generally vest over four years.  

The
fair value of options granted are estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes Model which includes several variables
including expected life, risk free interest rate, expected stock price volatility, stock option exercise patterns and expected
dividend yield. The Company also must estimate forfeitures for employee stock options. Management used the following weighted
average assumptions to value stock options granted during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share   

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional
common shares were dilutive. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the following common equivalent shares were excluded from the computation
of loss per share since their effects are anti-dilutive.

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased the inventory of Oncoscope, Inc. from the Trustee of Ondoscope s
bankruptcy proceeding for a total of $40,000. This amount, net of amounts sold of $2,100, has been included in raw materials.  

Recently
Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amended Interest   Imputation of Interest of the Accounting Standards Codification.
The amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability, which were presented as deferred
charges (assets), be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The
recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The amendment
is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which provides guidance for accounting for leases. The new
guidance requires companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets, initially
measured at the present value of the lease payments. The accounting guidance for lessors is largely unchanged. The ASU is effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. It is to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s financial statements.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statements in order for them to conform to the 2016 presentation. Such
reclassifications have no impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

Liabilities   

Note
Payable   

In
November 2014, the Company issued for cash of $100,000 an unsecured note payable and a five-year warrant with an exercise price
of $0.09 per share for the purchase of up to 50,000 shares of common stock. The terms of the note were a repayment of $115,000
if paid by February 18, 2015 and, if paid thereafter, the principal balance of the note was to be increased to $137,982 as of
October 1, 2015 and interest accrues at 20% from October 1, 2015 until paid. The note remained outstanding at September 30, 2016
and is accruing interest at 20%. The warrant was valued at $1,659 using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model and was recorded as additional
paid-in capital and expensed to non-cash interest in 2014.  

Notes
Payable- Related Parties   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two affiliates of the Company advanced to the Company cash in an accumulated amount
of $35,000 in exchange for six-month 10% promissory notes. The balance of the notes remains $35,000 at September 30, 2016.  

Convertible
Debentures   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has issued and outstanding Convertible Debentures ( Debentures ) with original
terms of three months to one year, an interest rate ranging from 10-20% per year and an original issue discount ranging from 5%
to 10% which, at the option of the holder, may convert  

SpectraScience,
Inc.   

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)   

into
common stock at initial conversion prices ranging from $0.01 to $0.099 per share. The Debentures were issued with detachable five
year cashless Holders Warrants that allow the holders to purchase one share of stock for each two shares available under the converted
Debentures at an exercise price ranging from $0.02 to $0.1287 per share. In addition, the Company issued five-year cashless Agent
Warrants equal to 10% of the total number of shares issuable under the Debentures and Holders Warrants at exercise prices ranging
from $0.0745 to $0.1287 per share. For debentures issued through March 31, 2013, at the option of the Debenture holder, the terms
of the Debentures and Holders Warrants are subject to an exchange feature in the event that the Company issues securities with
terms more favorable than those of the then outstanding Debentures and Holders Warrants. Debentures issued subsequent to March
31, 2013 do not contain such an exchange clause. The gross amount of Debentures outstanding is $6,232,345 as of September 30,
2016.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has issued and outstanding Convertible Debentures ( Variable Debentures )
with original terms of 9 months to one year, interest rates ranging from 0-10% per year and original issue discounts ranging from
0-10% which contain variable conversion rates ranging from discounts of 40-50% of the Company s common stock based on the
Company s common stock trading prices ranging from 10-25 days previous to conversion. The Variable Debentures contain prepayment
options which enable the Company to prepay the notes for periods of 0-180 days subsequent to issuance at premiums ranging from
0-50%. The gross amount of Variable Debentures outstanding is $197,451 as of September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances of the Debentures are as follows:  

Secured
Convertible Note   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued for cash of $850,000 Secured Convertible Debentures (the  Debentures )
to two accredited investors. The terms of the Debentures are for three years, a conversion price of $0.01 per share and an annual
interest rate of 8%. The secured interest is on all of the assets of the Company.  

Derivative
Liability   

Since
the Company issued Convertible Debentures which included Holders Warrants, Agent Warrants and a conversion option that includes
a possible exchange feature in the event of a future financing on terms more favorable than those of the existing warrants and
debentures, this results in the warrants and conversion feature of the debentures being recorded as a liability and measured at  

SpectraScience,
Inc.   

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements (continued)   

fair
value. In addition, outstanding Variable Debentures contain variable conversion rates based on unknown future prices of the Company s
common stock resulting in a conversion feature. The Company measures these warrants and conversion features using a Black-Scholes
option valuation model using similar assumptions to those described under  Stock-Based Compensation.  The period over
which the Company will be required to evaluate the fair value of the warrants is approximately five years and the period over
which the Company will be required to evaluate the fair value of the conversion features are six to twelve months or conversion.  

The
assumptions used in determining fair value represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if factors change, including changes in the market value of the
Company s common stock, managements  assessment of the probability of a more favorably priced future financing or
significant fluctuations in the volatility of the trading market for the Company s common stock, the Company s fair
value estimates could be materially different in the future.  

The
Company computes the fair value of the derivative liability at each reporting period and the change in the fair value is recorded
as non-cash expense or non-cash income. The key component in the value of the derivative liability is the Company s stock
price, which is subject to significant fluctuation and is not under the Company s control. Therefore, the resulting effect
on net loss is subject to significant fluctuation and will continue to be so until the Company s Debentures, which the convertible
feature is associated with, are converted into common stock or paid in full with cash. Assuming all other fair value inputs remain
constant, the Company will record non-cash expense when its stock price increases and non-cash income when its stock price decreases.  

In
addition, since the number of shares issuable under the Variable Debentures are undeterminable, the Company may be required to
issue shares in excess of the number of shares authorized by its shareholders. As a result, when the Company determines that is
does not have sufficient shares to meet the obligations of derivative unexercised debentures, warrants and options, the derivatives
must be valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing method and a liability is recorded as though the obligations would be settled
using some means other than stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined that it was over committed
to the number of shares issuable on the exercise of outstanding debentures, stock options and warrants for approximately 266,000,000
shares. On October 23, 2016, there was an increase in authorized shares that was reflected on the September 30, 2016 Balance Sheet
but was not used in the calculation to determine the over commitment of shares as of September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances of the Derivative Liability are as follows:

the equity method of valuing the note and warrant.

Shareholders  Deficit   

Common
Stock    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, holders of Convertible Debentures with a face value of $196,944 and accrued interest
of $4,745 converted their debentures into 305,277,793 shares of common stock. In addition, associated with these debentures, the
Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $53,038.  

Warrants   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in conjunction with the sale of Convertible Debentures, the Company issued five-year
common stock purchase warrants to acquire up to 15,000,000 shares to holders of the Debentures. These warrants have an exercise
price of $0.02 per share.  

In
March 2016, the Company issued a warrant exercisable into up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for services provided
by a consultant. The value of these warrants, $1,652, was determined using the Black-Scholes Option pricing model and was included
as non-cash expenses and additional paid-in capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Series
AA Preferred Shares   

On
April 15, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation,
as amended (the  Articles of Incorporation ), in the form of a Certificate of Designation that authorized the issuance
of up to three thousand (3,000) shares of a new series of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, designated  Series
AA Super Voting Preferred Stock,  for which the board of directors established the rights, preferences and limitations thereof.

Fair Value Measurements   

Accounting
guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of
assets and liabilities using a hierarchy system, and defines  

  required
disclosures. It clarifies that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business.  

The
Company s balance sheet contains derivative and warrant liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
The three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value is as follows:  

Level
1: uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: uses observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.  

Level
3: uses unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.  

The
fair value of the Company s recorded derivative and warrant liabilities is determined based on unobservable inputs that
are not corroborated by market data, which require a Level 3 classification. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was used
to determine the fair value with similar assumptions to those described under  Stock-Based Compensation . The Company
records derivative and warrant liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operation.

In
computing the fair value of the derivative and warrant liability at September 30, 2016, management estimated a 60% probability
of a down round financing event at a price of $0.025 and a 9% to 34% probability that existing note holders with exchange privileges
would exchange their existing debentures and warrants for new debentures and warrants.

Business   

SpectraScience,
Inc. (the  Company,   SpectraScience,   we,   our,  or  us ) develops
and manufactures innovative Laser Induced Fluorescence spectrophotometry systems capable of determining whether tissue is normal,
pre-cancerous or cancerous without removing tissue from the body. The WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System (the  WavSTAT System )
is SpectraScience s first product to incorporate its proprietary fluorescence technology for clinical use. The WavSTAT System
carries the CE mark designation which allows for the sale and marketing in the European Union for the diagnosis of cancer. We
are developing light-based diagnostics for additional indications including inflammatory bowel disease and esophageal cancer.
Once these additional applications are developed we plan to self-certify for CE mark approval for sale in the European Union and
then file an application with the FDA seeking permission to begin marketing for that indication for use in the United States.
We believe we have a strong intellectual property portfolio that will allow us to continue to expand our WavSTAT cancer diagnosis
platform to address the diagnosis of multiple cancers, utilize additional proprietary bio-photonic techniques to improve the WavSTAT s
overall diagnostic performance and ultimately allow for the detection of cancer and pre-cancer over a relatively large area of
examined tissue.  

Our
principal executive offices are located at 11568 Sorrento Valley Rd., Suite 11, San Diego, CA 92121. We can be reached by telephone
at (858) 847-0200; by fax at (858) 847-0880; or by email at info@spectrascience.com. We have a Web site at http://www.spectrascience.com.
The information contained on our Web site shall not be deemed to be a part of this Report.  

Plan
of Operation   

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, SpectraScience carried forward on the improvements made to the WavSTAT4 in fiscal
2011 and continued working with PENTAX Europe, GmbH ( PENTAX ) and other distributors, for distribution of its products
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  

Over
the next 12 months, SpectraScience intends to:  

Market
    and sell the WavSTAT4 Optical Biopsy System colon cancer diagnostic application through PENTAX and other distribution
    channels in the European Union;   

Conduct
    country-specific evaluation trials to demonstrate the effectiveness and cost benefit of the WavSTAT4 Optical Biopsy System
    in each relevant European jurisdiction;   

Coordinate
    the creation and publication of scientific papers and presentations related to the country-specific evaluation trials
    to support widespread education and adoption of the WavSTAT4;   

Pursue
    the introduction of the WavSTAT4 colon cancer application in other international markets, in particular China, Saudi
    Arabia and India;   

Begin
    meeting with the FDA towards the preparation and submission of a Supplemental PMA filing  with the FDA and plan
    for additional clinical trials to support eventual approval for sale in the  nited States;   

Begin
    the design and planning for the next generation of multi-modal fluorescence and broadband spectroscopy systems at our
    facility in San Diego, California.   

Continue
    to expand and refine our intellectual property portfolio.   

Results
of Operations    

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   

There
was minimal revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and no revenue during the three months ended September 30,
2015. We anticipate that revenue will increase as a result of our distribution agreement with PENTAX and continuing direct sales
efforts in certain locations once sufficient information has been accumulated from our MORDIS trials in Europe.  

Cost
of Revenue   

There
was minimal cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and no cost of sales during the three months ended
September 30, 2015. We anticipate that as revenue increases as a result of our distribution agreement with PENTAX and continuing
direct sales efforts in certain locations once sufficient information has been accumulated from our MORDIS trials in Europe, that
associated costs will also increase.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses decreased by $44,977, 26.1%, to $127,428 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $172,405 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was due to a decrease in clinical costs. We anticipate that clinical costs
will increase as we proceed with our introduction of the WaveSTAT4 in Europe.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses remained stable at $281,993 compared to $284,724 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We anticipate
that general and administrative expenses will increase as we increase our activity in Europe.  

Sales
and Marketing Expenses   

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by $39,603, 78.1%, to $90,303 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $54,700 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the increase was an increase in payroll costs related to the change in foreign
currency values. We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase as we increase our activity in Europe.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

Other
income (expense) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was expense of $279,476 compared to income of $298,670 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. This change was due primarily to a change in valuation of our derivative liabilities. We anticipate
continued large fluctuations in other income (expense) as a result of quarterly re-evaluating these obligations.  

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   

There
was minimal revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and no revenue during the nine months ended September 30,
2015. We anticipate that revenue will increase as a result of our distribution agreement with PENTAX and continuing direct sales
efforts in certain locations once sufficient information has been accumulated from our MORDIS trials in Europe.  

Cost
of Revenue   

There
was minimal cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a negative cost of sales of $12,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The negative amount was the result of four systems coming off warranty with no associated
costs. We anticipate that as revenue increases as a result of our distribution agreement with PENTAX and continuing direct sales
efforts in certain locations once sufficient information has been accumulated from our MORDIS trials in Europe, that associated
costs will also increase. The following table reflects the status of the warranty reserve as of September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses increased by $11,175, 2.2%, to $515,590 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $504,415 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in consulting costs. We anticipate that clinical
costs will increase as we proceed with our introduction of the WaveSTAT4 in Europe.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses decreased by $114,942, 11.4%, to $896,047 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$1,010,989 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in costs associated with
the issuance of stock options in an amount of approximately $55,000, a reduction in legal and professional fees of approximately
$45,000 and a reduction in travel and related expenses of approximately $5,000. We anticipate that general and administrative
expenses will increase as we increase our activity in Europe.  

Sales
and Marketing Expenses   

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by $86,270, 46.7%, to $270,930 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $184,660 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the increase was an increase in stock option expense of approximately
$19,000 and an increase in payroll costs of approximately $59,000. We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase
as we increase our activity in Europe.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

Other
income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was expense of $1,241,231 compared to expense of $974,047 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change was due primarily to a change in valuation of our derivative liabilities. We
anticipate continued large fluctuations in other income (expense) as a result of quarterly re-evaluating these obligations.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Historically,
the Company s sources of cash have come from the issuance and sales of equity securities and debentures. The Company s
historical cash outflows have been primarily used for operating activities including research, development, administrative and
sales activities. Fluctuations in the Company s working capital due to timing differences of its cash receipts and cash
disbursements also impact its cash flow. The Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses through at least
the end of 2016, as it completes proof-of-concept trials, conducts outcome-based clinical studies and increases sales and marketing
efforts to commercialize the WavSTAT4 Systems in Europe. If the Company does not receive sufficient funding, there is substantial
doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. The Company may incur unknown expenses or may not be able
to meet its revenue forecast, and one or more of these circumstances would require the Company to seek additional capital. The
Company may not be able to obtain equity capital or debt funding on terms that are acceptable. Even if the Company receives additional
funding, such proceeds may not be sufficient to allow the Company to sustain operations until it becomes profitable and begins
to generate positive cash flows from operations.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $10,503,770 and cash of $1,927, compared to a working capital
deficit of $8,324,600 and cash of $127,493 as of December 31, 2015. In December 2011, the Company entered into an Engagement Agreement
with Laidlaw   Company (UK) Ltd., which Engagement Agreement was amended in July 2012. Under the Engagement Agreement, Laidlaw
agreed to assist the Company in raising up to $20.0 million in capital over a two-year period from the date of the Engagement
Agreement. Subsequent to March 31, 2013, the Company has engaged other agents to assist the Company with raising capital and has
commenced raising capital on its own. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $1,185,000, net of transaction
costs of $34,000, under these agreements. However, if the Company does not receive additional funds in a timely manner, the Company
could be in jeopardy as a going concern. The Company may not be able to find alternative capital or raise capital or debt on terms
that are acceptable. Management believes that if the events defined in the Engagement Agreements occur as expected, or if the
Company is otherwise able to raise a similar level of funds, such proceeds will be sufficient to allow the Company to sustain
operations until it attains profitability and positive cash flows from operations. However, the Company may incur unknown expenses
or may not be able to meet its revenue expectations requiring it to seek additional capital. In such event, the Company may not
be able to find capital or raise capital or debt on terms that are acceptable.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We

including attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding with respect to the

(b)
after a determination that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this

directors not at the time parties to the proceeding, duly designated to act in the matter by a majority of the full Board, including
directors who are parties;  

(3)
if a determination is not made under clause (1) or (2) by special legal counsel, selected either by a majority of the Board or
a committee by vote pursuant to clause ( I ) or (2) or, if the requisite quorum of the full Board cannot be obtained and the committee
cannot be established, by a majority of the full Board including directors who are parties;  

(4)
if a determination is not made under clauses (1) to (3) by the shareholders, excluding the votes of shares held by parties to

with a proceeding by or on behalf of the corporation shall report to the shareholders in writing.

PREFERENCES OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK.   

DESIGNATION
AND RANK  

SpectraScience,
Inc. a Minnesota corporation (the  Company ), hereby designates out of its authorized, but unissued, shares of preferred
stock, a new series of preferred stock entitled Series A Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the  Series A Preferred
Stock ). The maximum number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be two million two hundred and fifty thousand (2,250,000)
shares. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to dividends and rights upon liquidation, winding up and dissolution,
senior to the Common Stock of the Company.  

DIVIDENDS  

Dividends
are payable on the Series A Preferred Stock only if, when and in the amount declared by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
If the Company declares a dividend or a distribution on any Common Stock of the Company, the Company shall pay a dividend or make
a distribution on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount per share equal to the maximum amount paid or
set aside for all shares of Common Stock into which each such share of Series A Preferred Stock could then be converted (the  Preferred
Dividend ). The Company shall pay the Preferred Dividend prior to paying a dividend or distribution to the holders of Common
Stock.  

LIQUIDATION
PREFERENCE  

VOTING
RIGHTS  

Each
holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are then convertible and shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting
rights and powers of the Common Stock, except as otherwise required by Minnesota law or as set forth in this Designation, voting
together with the Common Stock as a single class. Fractional votes shall not be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting
from the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock (in the case of each holder, after aggregating all fractional
shares held by such holder into the maximum number of whole shares) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half
being rounded upward). Each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Common Stock held. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall vote as a single class to elect one director of the Company if
on the record date for such election at least five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding.  

CONVERSION  

The
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion rights (the  Conversion Rights ) as defined
below:  

ANTI-DILUTION
ADJUSTMENTS  

The
Conversion Price is subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 6.  

Adjustments
for Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided by
stock split, stock dividend or otherwise into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall, concurrently
within the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be combined or consolidated into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall, concurrently with
the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.  

Stock
Dividends and Other Distributions . In the event the Company makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders
of Common Stock entitled to receive, any distribution payable in property, in securities of other persons or of the Company or
evidences of indebtedness of other persons or of the Company, unless otherwise adjusted for in this Section 6 or as provided for
in Section 2 in connection with a Preferred Dividend, then, and in each such event, the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall
receive, at the time of such distribution, the amount of any such distribution that they would have received had their Class A
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the date of such event.  

Adjustments
for Reorganization, Reclassification or Similar Events . If the Common Stock shall be changed into the same or a different
number of shares of any other class or classes of stock or other securities or property, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification
or otherwise, then each share of Class A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company deliverable upon conversion
of such shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification or other event.  

Adjustments
for Diluting Issues . In addition to the adjustments to the Conversion Price provided above, the Conversion Price shall be
further adjusted from time to time as follows (the main operative provision hereof is in Section 6(d)(iii) below):  

Special
Definitions:   

Options  
shall mean rights, options or warrants (other than as excluded by Section 6(d)(i)(D) below) to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire either Common Stock or Convertible Securities (as defined herein).  

Original
Issue Date   shall mean the date of the Closing of a transaction or series of transactions in which the Company issues
shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate consideration of at least $1,000,000.  

Convertible
Securities   shall mean securities (other than as excluded by Section 6(d)(i)(D) below) convertible, either directly
or indirectly, into or exchangeable for Common Stock.  

Additional
Shares of Common Stock   shall mean all shares of Common Stock, for which an adjustment under section 6(a) has already
been made, issued (or deemed to be issued) by the Company after the Original Issue Date other than the following:  

Shares
of Common Stock issued (or deemed to be issued) upon the conversion of any of the Series A Preferred Stock, or as a dividend or
distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock;  

Shares
of Common Stock issued (or deemed to be issued) upon the conversion of any debenture, warrant, option or other convertible security
that is outstanding as of the Original Issue Date or issued in connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, unless
such exercise or conversion price was adjusted downward after the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock;  

Shares
of Common Stock issued (or deemed to be issued) upon a stock split, stock dividend or other subdivision of shares of Common Stock;  

Shares
of Common Stock (or options to purchase such shares) issued (or deemed to be issued) to employees, consultants or directors pursuant
to stock option, stock grant, stock purchase or similar plans or arrangements approved by the Company s Board of Directors,
including the Series A Director;  

Deemed
Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock . Except as otherwise provided in Section 6(d), if the Company at any time or from
time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the
determination of any holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the
maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for
a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities and Options therefore, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such record date shall have been fixed, as of the close
of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:  

No
further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of such Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities at the same exercise,
conversion or exchange price or ratio in effect upon the adoption of the applicable plan or grant of such Option or Convertible
Securities;  

If
such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease
in the consideration payable to the Company, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect thereto, and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease
becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease;  

Upon
the expiration or termination of any such Option or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which
shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof or upon occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto, and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration:  

In
the case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common Stock, be recomputed as though the only Additional Shares of Common Stock
issued were shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefore was the consideration actually received by the Company for
the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise,
or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities, whether or not converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration,
if any, actually received by the Company upon such conversion or exchange; and;  

In
the case of Options for Convertible Securities, be recomputed as though only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued
upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options and the consideration received by the Company for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Company for the
issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Company upon the
issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised.  

No
readjustment pursuant to Section 6(d) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the
Conversion Price existing immediately prior to the original adjustment with respect to the issuance of such Options or Convertible
Securities, as adjusted for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to be issued) between such original adjustment
date and such readjustment date; and in the case of any Option or Convertible Security with respect to which the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or exchange thereof is not determinable, no adjustment to the Conversion
Price shall be made until such number becomes determinable.  

Adjustments
for Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock . If the Company, at any time after the Original Issue Date, shall issue
any Additional Shares of Common Stock (otherwise than provided in sections 6(a), 6(b) or 6(c) above) at a price per share less
than the applicable Conversion Price then in effect or without consideration, then the applicable Conversion Price upon each such
issuance shall be adjusted to the consideration per share paid for the Additional Common Stock.  

The
provisions of Section 6(d)(iii) shall not apply under any of the circumstances for which an adjustment is provided in Sections
6(a), 6(b) or 6(c) above. No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made under this Section 6(d) upon the issuance
of any Additional Shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to any Options or Convertible Securities if upon the issuance
of such Options or Convertible Securities (x) any adjustment shall have been made pursuant to Section 6(d)(ii) above or (y) no
adjustment was required pursuant to this Section 6(d)(iii). No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made under
this Section 6(d)(iii) in an amount less than $.01 per share, but any such lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall
be made at the time and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which together with any adjustments so carried forward
shall amount to $.01 per share or more; provided, however, that upon any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price as a result
of any dividend or distribution payable in Common Stock or Convertible Securities or the reclassification, subdivision or combination
of Common Stock into a greater or smaller number of shares, the foregoing figure of $.01 per share (or such figure as last adjusted)
shall be adjusted (to the nearest one-half cent) in proportion to the adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price.  

Determination
of Consideration . For purposes of this Section 6(d), the consideration received by the Company for any Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued (or deemed to be issued) shall be computed as follows:  

Cash
and Property . Such consideration shall:  

Insofar
as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the Company;  

Insofar
as it consists of securities and the value of such securities is not determinable by reference to a separate agreement, (A) if
the securities are then traded on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a similar national quotation system),
then the value shall be computed based on the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the thirty (30)-day period ending on the date of receipt by the Company, (B) if the securities are actively traded over-the-counter,
then the value shall be computed based on the average of the closing bid prices over the thirty (30) day ending on the date of
receipt by the Company, and (C) if there is no active public market, then the value shall be computed based on the fair market
value thereof on the date of receipt by the Company, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors;  

Insofar
as it consists of property other than cash and securities, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issuance,
as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and if Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued (or deemed to be issued)
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for consideration which cover both, by the proportion
of such consideration so received, computed as provided in the immediately preceding Sections 6(d)(iv)(A)(1), 6(d)(iv)(A)(2) and
6(d)(iv)(A)(3), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.  

Options
and Convertible Securities . The consideration received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued pursuant to Section 6(d) relating to Option and Convertible Securities, shall be the sum of (x) the total amount,
if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus (y)
the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to
any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Company upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.  

The
Conversion Price shall also be subject to adjustment on the date of issuance of the audited financial statements of the Company
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007, in the event that the gross revenues of the Company for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2007, excluding grants and other development funds, interest income, and other non-operating income, and excluding revenues
from acquired companies or products, is less than the target revenues set forth below:  

Certificate
as to Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price, the Company, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series
A Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series A Preferred
Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to the holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments,
(ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.  

OTHER
PROVISIONS   

The
consent of the holders of 67% of the Series A Preferred Stock voting as a separate class shall be required for the Company to
take any action that (i) alters or changes the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) increases
or decreases the authorized number of shares of capital stock, (iii) creates (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class
or series of shares having rights, preferences or privileges senior to or in parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, (iv) results
in the redemption of any shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to equity incentive agreements giving the Company the right
to repurchase shares upon the termination of services), (v) results in a Change of Control (as defined herein), (vi) amends or
waives any provisions of the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws relative to the Series A Preferred Stock, or
(vii) results in the payment or declaration of any dividend on any shares of equity securities. A  Change in Control 
shall mean the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions including,
without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets or shares of
stock of the Company (each a  Change of Control ); provided, however, that, in each such case, the applicable transaction
shall not be deemed a Change of Control unless the Company s shareholders of record as constituted immediately prior to
such transaction (by virtue of shares of the Company owned by such shareholders or securities issued solely with respect thereto
as consideration for the Company s acquisition or sale or otherwise) hold less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving
or acquiring entity.  

No
shares of Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, repurchase, conversion or otherwise shall
be reissued as Series A Preferred Stock. All such shares shall be cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock which the Company shall be authorized to issue and shall once again become undesignated shares of the Company s
preferred stock under Section 2.1 of the Company s amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.  

Upon
receipt by the Company of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificates
representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of a satisfactory indemnification
undertaking by the holder to the Company and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the Series A Preferred
Stock certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new preferred stock certificate(s) of like tenor and date; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates if the holder contemporaneously requests
the Company to convert such shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock.  

NO
CUMULATIVE VOTING RIGHTS   

No
holder of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have any cumulative voting rights.  

NO
PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS   

No
holder of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have any preemptive rights by virtue of Section 302A.413 of the Minnesota Statutes
(or any amendment or restatement thereof) to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of the Company of any class,
whether unissued or not or hereafter authorized, or any obligations or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
such shares.

    Voting Rights.   

2.1
General. At all meetings of the shareholders of the Company and in the case of any actions of shareholders in lieu of a meeting,
each holder of the Series B Stock shall have that number of votes on all matters submitted to the shareholders that is equal to
the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such holder s shares of Series B Stock are then convertible, as provided
in Section 5 hereof, at the record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no such
record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of such shareholders is affected. Except as
may be otherwise provided in this Certificate, by agreement, or by law, the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of the
Series B Stock shall vote together as a single class on all actions to be taken by the shareholders of the Company.  

2.2
Additional Class Votes by the Series B Stock. For so long as at least 35% of the shares of Series B Stock originally issued remain
outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote of at least 67% of the then outstanding shares of the Series
B Stock, with each share of the Series B Preferred entitled to one vote in each instance:  

(i)
take any action, including, without limitation, any action that constitutes or results in an amendment or waiver of any provision
of the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, if such action in any way affects, alters or changes any existing
rights, preferences, privileges or provisions relating to the Series B Stock or the holders thereof, or results in any increase
or decrease in the authorized number of shares of the Series B Stock;  

(ii)
authorize, issue or otherwise create (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class of additional shares of capital stock of
the Company having rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to or on priority with the Series B Stock (including any
additional shares of the Series B Stock).  

3.
    Dividends.   

3.1
Dividends. No dividend or other distribution shall accrue or be paid with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company
for any period, whether before or after the effective date of this Certificate, unless and until all accrued dividends on the
Series B Stock are paid in full. The Series B Stock shall be entitled to receive cumulative dividends in preference to any dividend
which may be declared on the Common Stock at the rate of 8% of the Original Issue Price (subject to any adjustment for stock splits,
stock dividends or other recapitalizations). Dividends on shares of capital stock of the Company shall be payable only out of
funds legally available therefore. Dividends on the Series B Stock shall be due and payable annually on the last business day
of December and shall be payable in cash, or at the option of the Company, in shares of Common Stock.  

3.2
Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 3 shall be payable in property other than cash (including
without limitation Common Stock), the value of such dividend shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined
in good faith by the Board.  

3.3
Payments on Conversion. If the Company shall have accrued but unpaid cash dividends with respect to any of the Series B Stock
upon its conversion as provided in Section 5 hereof, then all such accrued but unpaid dividends on such converted shares shall
be canceled.  

4.
    Liquidation Rights.   

4.1
Preference of the Series B Stock. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of the Series B Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company
available for distribution to its shareholders, whether such assets are capital, surplus, or earnings, before any payment or declaration
and setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made in respect of the Common Stock or any other class or series of shares
ranking junior to the Series B Stock, an amount equal to (a) the Original Issue Price (subject to appropriate adjustments for
stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other combinations in the same manner as set forth in Section 5) plus (b)
declared but unpaid dividends to and including the date full payment shall be tendered to the holders of the Series B Stock (the
 Liquidation Price ) with respect to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution,
or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed to the holders of the Series B Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such shareholders of the full preferential amounts aforesaid, then all of the assets
of the Company shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series B Stock based upon the full Liquidation Price payable
with respect to such shares of the Series B Stock if such liquidation preference was paid in full.  

4.2
Reorganization; Sale of Assets. The merger, acquisition or consolidation of the Company into or with any other entity or entities
which results in the exchange of outstanding shares of the Company for securities or other consideration issued or paid or caused
to be issued or paid by any such entity or affiliate thereof pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately prior
to the transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding shares of the surviving corporation immediately after the transaction,
or any sale, lease, license (on an exclusive basis) or transfer by the Company of all or substantially all its assets, shall be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company within the meaning of the provisions of this Section 5 unless
this provision is waived by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 50% of the Series B Stock then outstanding.  

4.3
Notice. Written notice of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating a payment date and the place where said payments
shall be made, shall be given by mail, postage prepaid, or by telephone facsimile to non-U.S. residents, not less than 20 days
prior to the earlier of (i) the shareholders  meeting called to approve such transaction or (ii) the closing of such transaction,
to the holders of record of the Series B Stock, such notice to be addressed to each such holder at its address as shown by the
records of the Company. The first of such notices shall describe all material terms and conditions of the transaction and of Section
4.2 hereof (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a description of the value of the consideration, if any,
being offered to the holders of the Series B Stock in the transaction and the amount to which such holders would be entitled if
such transaction were (as described in Section 4.2 hereof) to be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company)
and the Company shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes to such terms and conditions. The transaction
shall in no event take place sooner than 20 days after the mailing by the Company of the first notice provided for herein or sooner
than 10 days after the mailing by the Company of any notice of material changes as provided for herein; provided that such periods
may be reduced upon the written consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the Series B Stock then outstanding, voting
together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis.  

5.
    Conversion. The holders of the
Series B Stock shall have the following conversion rights (the  Conversion Rights ):   

Optional
Conversion of the Series B Stock. The Series B Stock shall be convertible, in whole or in part, without the payment of any additional
consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of this Certificate at
the office of the Company into that number of shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $.20 by the Conversion Price
(as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion and then multiplying such quotient by each share of the Series B Stock
to be converted. The price at which the shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion without payment of any additional
consideration by the holder thereof shall be initially $.20 per share (the  Conversion Price ). The Conversion Price
shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of the Common Stock into which the Series B Stock is convertible,
as hereinafter provided.  

Automatic
Conversion of the Series B Stock. If at any time (a) the Company shall complete a Qualified Public Offering, or (b) the holders
of at least 67% of the outstanding Series B Stock shall consent in writing to the conversion of the Series B Stock into shares
of the Common Stock, or (c) the Conversion Shares upon issuance will be Free Trading, then effective upon (i) the closing of the
sale of such shares by the Company pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, (ii) such consent of the holders of the Series
B Stock, or (iii) notice by the Company to the holders of the Series B Stock that the Conversion Shares are Free Trading, as the
case may be, all outstanding shares of Series B Stock shall automatically convert into shares of the Common Stock at the Conversion
Price as of a date specified by the Company (the  Mandatory Conversion Date ).  

Fractional
Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series B Stock. In lieu of any fractional
share to which any holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion of some or all of the Series B Stock owned by such holder,
the Company shall, at the discretion of the Board, pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective Conversion
Price or round up to the nearest whole share.  

Mechanics
of Optional Conversion. Before any holder of the Series B Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common
Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefore, endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder s
attorney duly authorized in writing, at the office of the Company and shall give written notice to the Company at such office
that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein such holder s name or the name of the nominees in which
such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of the Common Stock to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of the Series B Stock, or to such holder s nominee
or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of the Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled
as aforesaid, together with cash if any, to be delivered in lieu of any fraction of a share. Such conversion shall be deemed to
have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Series B Stock to
be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of the Common Stock on such date. From and after such date, all
rights of the holder with respect to the Series B Stock so converted shall terminate, except only the right of such holder, upon
the surrender of his, her or its certificate or certificates therefore, to receive certificates for the number of shares of the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof, certificates for the number of shares of the Series B Stock remaining and cash
for fractional shares.  

Mechanics
of Automatic Conversion. All holders of record of shares of the Series B Stock will be given at written notice of the date of
any automatic conversion pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof not later than three business days  following the actual date of
such automatic conversion. Each such notice shall designate a place for exchange of all of the shares of such Series B Stock.
Such notices will be sent by mail, first class, postage prepaid to each record holder of the Series B Stock at such holder s
address appearing on the Company s stock register, or by overnight courier service in the case of the notice prior to the
actual date of conversion. Each holder of shares of the Series B Stock shall surrender such holder s certificate or certificates
for all such shares to the Company at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number
of shares of the Common Stock or other securities to which such holder is entitled. Failure to provide such notice or untimely
notice shall not affect the validity of automatic conversion hereunder. On the date fixed for conversion, all rights with respect
to the Series B Stock will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefore, to receive certificates for the number of shares of the Common Stock or other securities into which such Series B Stock
has been converted and cash for fractional shares. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed
by the registered holder or by her, his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All certificates evidencing shares of the
Series B Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after
the date such certificates are so required to be surrendered, be deemed to have been retired and canceled and the shares of the
Series B Stock represented thereby converted into the Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder
or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date; provided that the Company may require the holder to
provide adequate protection to the Company for the loss of such certificate(s) prior to issuing certificates for shares of Common
Stock to such holder. As soon as practicable after the date of such automatic conversion and the surrender of the certificate
or certificates for the Series B Stock as aforesaid, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or to
her, his or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock or other securities
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section 5.3 hereof in respect of
any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.  

Certain
Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Splits, Dividends, Mergers, Reorganizations, Etc.  

Adjustment
for Stock Splits, Stock Dividends and Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall,
after the filing of this Certificate, be further subdivided (split), or combined (reverse split), by reclassification or otherwise,
or in the event of any dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the applicable Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination, dividend or other distribution shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such subdivision, combination, dividend or other distribution, be proportionately adjusted.  

Adjustment
for Merger or Reorganization, Etc. In the event of a reclassification, reorganization or exchange (other than described in Section
5.6(a) above) or any merger, acquisition, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with another company or entity (other
than a merger, acquisition or other consolidation or reorganization as defined in Section 4.2 hereof, which is considered a liquidation
pursuant to Section 4 above), each share of the Series B Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock
or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company deliverable upon
conversion of the Series B Stock would have been entitled upon such reclassification, reorganization, exchange, consolidation,
merger or conveyance had the conversion occurred immediately prior to the event; and, in any such case, appropriate adjustment
(as determined by the Board) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and
interests thereafter of the holders of the Series B Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions
with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly
as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series
B Stock.  

Duration
of Adjusted Conversion Price. Following each computation or readjustment of an adjusted Conversion Price as provided above in
this Section 5, the new adjusted Conversion Price shall remain in effect until a further computation or readjustment thereof is
required by this Section 5.  

Other
Action Affecting the Common Stock. In case, after the filing of this Certificate, the Company shall take any action affecting
the Common Stock, other than an action described above in this Section 5, which in the good faith opinion of the Board would have
a materially adverse effect upon the Conversion Rights of the Series B Stock granted herein, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
in such manner and at such time as the Board may in good faith determine to be equitable in the circumstances.  

Certificate
as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5,
the Company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish
to each holder of the applicable Series B Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in reasonable
detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request, at any time,
of any holder of the Series B Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth: (i) such
adjustments and readjustments; (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect; and (iii) the number of shares of the
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of such Series
B Stock.  

Notices
of Record Date. In the event of any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose
of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend which is the same as cash
dividends paid in previous quarters) or other distribution, any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or
recapitalization of the Company s capital stock, any consolidation or merger with or into another Company, any transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company
shall mail to each holder of the Series B Stock at least 10 days prior to the date specified for the taking of a record, a notice
specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.  

Common
Stock Reserved. The Company shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock such number of shares
of the Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the Series B Stock.  

Payment
of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed
with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of shares of the Series B Stock, other than
any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of the Common Stock
in a name other than that in which the shares of the Series B Stock so converted were registered.  

No
Impairment. The Company will not through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
hereunder by the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section
5 and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders
of the Series B Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.10 shall prohibit the Company
from amending its Articles with the requisite consent of its shareholders and the Board of Directors.  

Status
of Series B Stock Upon Retirement.  

Shares
of Series B Stock which are acquired or redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to Section 5 shall become authorized undesignated

1.6
  Series C Stock   shall mean Series C Preferred Stock of the Company.  

2.
 Voting Rights.   

2.1
 General . At all meetings of the shareholders of the Company and in the case of any actions of shareholders in lieu of a
meeting, each holder of the Series C Stock shall have that number of votes on all matters submitted to the shareholders that is
equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such holder s shares of Series C Stock are then convertible,
as provided in Section 5 hereof, at the record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on such matters
or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of such shareholders is affected.
Except as may be otherwise provided in this Certificate, by agreement, or by law, the holders of the Common Stock and the holders
of the Series C Stock shall vote together as a single class on all actions to be taken by the shareholders of the Company.  

2.2
 Additional Class Votes by the Series C Stock . For so long as at least 35% of the shares of Series C Stock originally issued
remain outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote of at least 67% of the then outstanding shares of the
Series C Stock, with each share of the Series C Stock entitled to one vote in each instance:  

(i)
Take any action, including, without limitation, any action that constitutes or results in an amendment or waiver of any provision
of the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, if such action in any way affects, alters or changes any existing
rights, preferences, privileges or provisions relating to the Series C Stock or the holders thereof, or results in any increase
or decrease in the authorized number of shares of the Series C Stock;  

(ii)
Authorize, issue or otherwise create (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class of additional shares of capital stock of
the Company having rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to or on priority with the Series C Stock (including any
additional shares of the Series C Stock).  

3.
 Dividends.   

3.1
 Dividends . Holders of Series C Stock shall not be entitled to the payment of dividends, except at the discretion of the
Company s Board.  

3.2
 Non-Cash Dividends . Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 3 shall be payable in property other than cash (including
without limitation Common Stock), the value of such dividend shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property as determined
in good faith by the Board.  

3.3
 Payments on Conversion . If the Company shall have accrued but unpaid cash dividends with respect to any of the Series C
Stock upon its conversion as provided in Section 5 hereof, then all such accrued but unpaid dividends on such converted shares
shall be canceled.  

4.
 Liquidation Rights.   

4.1
 Preference of the Series C Stock . In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of the Series C Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company
available for distribution to its shareholders, whether such assets are capital, surplus, or earnings, before any payment or declaration
and setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made in respect of the Common Stock or any other class or series of shares
ranking junior to the Series C Stock, an amount equal to (a) the Original Issue Price (subject to appropriate adjustments for
stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other combinations in the same manner as set forth in Section 5) plus (b)
declared but unpaid dividends to and including the date full payment shall be tendered to the holders of the Series C Stock (the
 Liquidation Price ) with respect to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution,
or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed to the holders of the Series C Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such shareholders of the full preferential amounts aforesaid, then all of the assets
of the Company shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series C Stock based upon the full Liquidation Price payable
with respect to such shares of the Series C Stock if such liquidation preference was paid in full.  

4.2
 Reorganization; Sale of Assets . The merger, acquisition or consolidation of the Company into or with any other entity or
entities which results in the exchange of outstanding shares of the Company for securities or other consideration issued or paid
or caused to be issued or paid by any such entity or affiliate thereof pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately
prior to the transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding shares of the surviving corporation immediately after the transaction,
or any sale, lease, license (on an exclusive basis) or transfer by the Company of all or substantially all its assets, shall be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company within the meaning of the provisions of this Section 5 unless
this provision is waived by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 50% of the Series C Stock then outstanding.  

4.3
 Notice . Written notice of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating a payment date and the place where said
payments shall be made, shall be given by mail, postage prepaid, or by telephone facsimile to non-U.S. residents, not less than
20 days prior to the earlier of (i) the shareholders  meeting called to approve such transaction or (ii) the closing of
such transaction, to the holders of record of the Series C Stock, such notice to be addressed to each such holder at its address
as shown by the records of the Company. The first of such notices shall describe all material terms and conditions of the transaction
and of Section 4.2 hereof (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a description of the value of the consideration,
if any, being offered to the holders of the Series C Stock in the transaction and the amount to which such holders would be entitled
if such transaction were (as described in Section 4.2 hereof) to be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company)
and the Company shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes to such terms and conditions. The transaction
shall in no event take place sooner than 20 days after the mailing by the Company of the first notice provided for herein or sooner
than 10 days after the mailing by the Company of any notice of material changes as provided for herein; provided that such periods
may be reduced upon the written consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the Series C Stock then outstanding, voting
together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis.  

5.
 Conversion.  The holders of the Series C Stock shall have the following conversion rights (the   Conversion Rights  ):  

5.1
 Optional Conversion of the Series C Stock . The Series C Stock shall be convertible, in whole or in part, without the payment
of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of this
Certificate at the office of the Company into that number of shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $.20 by the Conversion
Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion and then multiplying such quotient by each share of the Series C
Stock to be converted. The price at which the shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion without payment of any
additional consideration by the holder thereof shall be initially $.20 per share (the  Conversion Price ). The Conversion
Price shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of the Common Stock into which the Series C Stock
is convertible, as hereinafter provided.  

5.2
 Automatic Conversion of the Series C Stock . If at any time (a) the Company shall complete a Qualified Public Offering,
or (b) the holders of at least 67% of the outstanding Series C Stock shall consent in writing to the conversion of the Series
C Stock into shares of the Common Stock, or (c) the Conversion Shares upon issuance will be Free Trading, then effective upon
(i) the closing of the sale of such shares by the Company pursuant to such Qualified Public Offering, (ii) such consent of the
holders of the Series C Stock, or (iii) notice by the Company to the holders of the Series C Stock that the Conversion Shares
are Free Trading, as the case may be, all outstanding shares of Series C Stock shall automatically convert into shares of the
Common Stock at the Conversion Price as of a date specified by the Company (the  Mandatory Conversion Date ).  

5.3
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series C Stock. In lieu
of any fractional share to which any holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion of some or all of the Series C Stock owned
by such holder, the Company shall, at the discretion of the Board, pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective
Conversion Price or round up to the nearest whole share.  

5.4
 Mechanics of Optional Conversion . Before any holder of the Series C Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full
shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefore, endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or by such
holder s attorney duly authorized in writing, at the office of the Company and shall give written notice to the Company
at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein such holder s name or the name of the
nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of the Common Stock to be issued. The Company
shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of the Series C Stock, or to such holder s
nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of the Common Stock to which such holder shall be
entitled as aforesaid, together with cash if any, to be delivered in lieu of any fraction of a share. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Series
C Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of the Common Stock on such date. From and after
such date, all rights of the holder with respect to the Series C Stock so converted shall terminate, except only the right of
such holder, upon the surrender of his, her or its certificate or certificates therefore, to receive certificates for the number
of shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof, certificates for the number of shares of the Series C Stock remaining
and cash for fractional shares.  

5.5
 Mechanics of Automatic Conversion . All holders of record of shares of the Series C Stock will be given at written notice
of the date of any automatic conversion pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof not later than three business days  following the
actual date of such automatic conversion. Each such notice shall designate a place for exchange of all of the shares of such Series
C Stock. Such notices will be sent by mail, first class, postage prepaid to each record holder of the Series C Stock at such holder s
address appearing on the Company s stock register, or by overnight courier service in the case of the notice prior to the
actual date of conversion. Each holder of shares of the Series C Stock shall surrender such holder s certificate or certificates
for all such shares to the Company at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number
of shares of the Common Stock or other securities to which such holder is entitled. Failure to provide such notice or untimely
notice shall not affect the validity of automatic conversion hereunder. On the date fixed for conversion, all rights with respect
to the Series C Stock will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates
therefore, to receive certificates for the number of shares of the Common Stock or other securities into which such Series C Stock
has been converted and cash for fractional shares. If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed
by the registered holder or by her, his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All certificates evidencing shares of the
Series C Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after
the date such certificates are so required to be surrendered, be deemed to have been retired and canceled and the shares of the
Series C Stock represented thereby converted into the Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder
or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date; provided that the Company may require the holder to
provide adequate protection to the Company for the loss of such certificate(s) prior to issuing certificates for shares of Common
Stock to such holder. As soon as practicable after the date of such automatic conversion and the surrender of the certificate
or certificates for the Series C Stock as aforesaid, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or to
her, his or its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of the Common Stock or other securities
issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in Section 5.3 hereof in respect of
any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion.  

5.6
 Certain Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Splits, Dividends, Mergers, Reorganizations, Etc.   

(a)
 Adjustment for Stock Splits, Stock Dividends and Combinations of Common Stock . In the event the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall, after the filing of this Certificate, be further subdivided (split), or combined (reverse split), by reclassification
or otherwise, or in the event of any dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the
applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination, dividend or other distribution shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, combination, dividend or other distribution, be proportionately adjusted.  

(b)
 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc . In the event of a reclassification, reorganization or exchange (other than
described in Section 5.6(a) above) or any merger, acquisition, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with another company
or entity (other than a merger, acquisition or other consolidation or reorganization as defined in Section 4.2 hereof, which is
considered a liquidation pursuant to Section 4 above), each share of the Series C Stock shall thereafter be convertible into the
number of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of the Common Stock of the
Company deliverable upon conversion of the Series C Stock would have been entitled upon such reclassification, reorganization,
exchange, consolidation, merger or conveyance had the conversion occurred immediately prior to the event; and, in any such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect
to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series C Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable,
as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion
of the Series C Stock.  

(c)
 Duration of Adjusted Conversion Price . Following each computation or readjustment of an adjusted Conversion Price as provided
above in this Section 5, the new adjusted Conversion Price shall remain in effect until a further computation or readjustment
thereof is required by this Section 5.  

(d)
 Other Action Affecting the Common Stock . In case, after the filing of this Certificate, the Company shall take any action
affecting the Common Stock, other than an action described above in this Section 5, which in the good faith opinion of the Board
would have a materially adverse effect upon the Conversion Rights of the Series C Stock granted herein, the Conversion Price shall
be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the Board may in good faith determine to be equitable in the circumstances.  

(e)
 Certificate as to Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant
to this Section 5, the Company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and furnish to each holder of the applicable Series C Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written
request, at any time, of any holder of the Series C Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth: (i) such adjustments and readjustments; (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time in effect; and (iii) the
number of shares of the Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion
of such Series C Stock.  

5.7
 Notices of Record Date . In the event of any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities
for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend which
is the same as cash dividends paid in previous quarters) or other distribution, any capital reorganization of the Company, any
reclassification or recapitalization of the Company s capital stock, any consolidation or merger with or into another Company,
any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company,
the Company shall mail to each holder of the Series C Stock at least 10 days prior to the date specified for the taking of a record,
a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.  

5.8
 Common Stock Reserved . The Company shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock such
number of shares of the Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the Series C Stock.  

5.9
 Payment of Taxes . The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that
may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of shares of the Series C Stock,
other than any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of the
Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of the Series C Stock so converted were registered.  

5.10
 No Impairment . The Company will not through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale
of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Section 5 and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of
the holders of the Series C Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.10 shall prohibit
the Company from amending its Articles with the requisite consent of its shareholders and the Board of Directors.  

6.
 Status of Series C Stock Upon Retirement .  

Shares
of Series C Stock which are acquired or redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to Section 5 shall become authorized undesignated
shares and may be redesignated and reissued by the Board of Directors as provided in the Articles.
