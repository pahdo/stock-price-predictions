FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS; This annual report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve risks and uncertainties. In addition, Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc., (formerly Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc.) (the  Company  or  Classic Rules ), may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Actual results are uncertain and may be impacted by many factors. In particular, certain risks and uncertainties that may impact the accuracy of the forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, expenses and operating results include without limitation; cycles of customer orders, general economic and competitive conditions and changing customer trends, technological advances and the number and timing of new product introductions, shipments of products and components from foreign suppliers, and changes in the mix of products ordered by customers. As a result, the actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 

Because of these and other factors that may affect the Company s operating results, past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 

History 

Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. was incorporated on the 16th day of November 2005 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Puritan Financial Group, Inc. (which was formerly Blue Ribbon International, Inc.) On March 24, 2008 a special meeting of the Shareholders of Puritan Financial Group, Inc. was held.  A quorum representing 90.2% of the issued common shares were present and the Broad of Directors stated that a special meeting of the Board of Directors held earlier that day approved the spinout of Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. 

March 26, 2008 was also set as the record date to establish those Blue Ribbon shareholders who are eligible to participate in the distribution.  Classic Rules did not issue shares to anyone other than our stockholders as of March 26, 2008. The special meeting of shareholders was held as scheduled and the distribution was approved by unanimous vote of Blue Ribbon shares represented at the meeting which consisted of approximately 90.2% of the then outstanding stock of Blue Ribbon. 

A stock dividend payable in shares of Blue Ribbon Pyrocool (now, Classic Rules) common stock to the shareholders of Puritan Financial has been authorized by Classic Rules and approved by its shareholders.  In March 2008, upon approval of its shareholders, Puritan Financial notified its stock transfer agent, Corporate Stock Transfer, that a spin-out company (Blue Ribbon Pyrocool) would be created and that there would be a distribution of 10,449,250 shares of Blue Ribbon common stock, representing all of the issued and outstanding stock of Blue Ribbon, for the benefit of the Puritan Financial shareholders with no action on the part of the shareholders and will be a book entry. 

4 

On July 15, 2008 the Board of Directors of Blue Ribbon executed a Corporate Resolution changing the name of Blue Ribbon to Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. 

On July 15, 2008 the Board of Directors of Classic Rules declared a 10 to 1 reverse split reducing the total number of outstanding shares from 10,449,250 to 1,044,925; but with the effect of rounding up by the transfer agent another 127 shares were added and the total became 1,045,052. 

Also on July 15, 2008, the ad hoc committee comprising a quorum of approximately 90.2% of the voting shares executed a Waiver of Notice for a Special Stockholders Meeting to be held on July 15, 2008 for the purpose of approving the distribution of Classic Rules stock to the Eligible Shareholders and to resolve the issuance of 8,705,084 shares to be distributed to the founding investors of Classic Rules. 

Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Connecticut on August 13, 2008. The subsidiary was incorporated to act as the accounting and administrative arm of the tournament, named   Classic Rules World Judo Championships  which held its first tournament on March 21, 2010 in New Rochelle, New York. The second tournament was held on May 7, 2011. The Company has not hosted a tournament since and has shifted its business focus to real estate investing and development. 

Our Business 

On June 2, 2014, the Company ceased its principal activities of hosting and sponsoring judo tournaments. The Company currently operates in real estate investment activities focused in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Background Information of the Business Plan 

The evolution of the extent to establish The Classic Rules Judo Championship series is the following: 

Preliminary Background Information 

The Company changed its name to Classic Rules Judo Championships and entered into a new business venture of hosting judo competitions on July 15, 2008. On June 2, 2014, the Company ceased its principal activities of hosting and sponsoring judo tournaments. The Company currently operates in real estate investment activities focused in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Government Regulation 

The Company is, and will continue to be, subject to several and varying governmental regulations. In general, the Company is subject to environmental, public health and safety, land use, trade and other governmental regulations, and national, state, or local taxation or tariffs. The Company s management will endeavor to ascertain and comply with all applicable regulations to the business of the Company. However, it may not be possible to predict with any degree of accuracy all applicable regulations or the impact of government regulation, and, compliance with such regulation will require certain efforts and resources of the Company. 

a) Penny Stock Regulations: Our shares are "penny stocks" covered by Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 and Rule 15g-9 promulgated thereunder. They impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). While Section 15(g) and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 apply to brokers-dealers, they do not apply to us. 

Rule 15g-1 exempts a number of specific transactions from the scope of the penny stock rules. 

Rule 15g-2 declares unlawful broker/dealer transactions in penny stocks unless the broker/dealer has first provided to the customer a standardized disclosure document. 

Rule 15g-3 provides that it is unlawful for a broker/dealer to engage in a penny stock transaction unless the broker/dealer first discloses and subsequently confirms to the customer current quotation prices or similar market information concerning the penny stock in question. 

Rule 15g-4 prohibits broker/dealers from completing penny stock transactions for a customer unless the broker/dealer first discloses to the customer the amount of compensation or other remuneration received as a result of the penny stock transaction. 

5 

Rule 15g-5 requires that a broker/dealer executing a penny stock transaction, other than one exempt under Rule 15g-1, disclose to its customer, at the time of or prior to the transaction, information about the sales persons compensation. 

Rule 15g-6 requires broker/dealers selling penny stocks to provide their customers with monthly account statements. 

Rule 15g-9 requires broker/dealers to approve the transaction for the customer's account; obtain a written agreement from the customer setting forth the identity and quantity of the stock being purchased; obtain from the customer information regarding his investment experience; make a determination that the investment is suitable for the investor; deliver to the customer a written statement for the basis for the suitability determination; notify the customer of his rights and remedies in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions; and, the FINRA's toll free telephone number and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers and their associated persons. The application of the penny stock rules may affect your ability to resell your shares. 

The FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker/dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.  Under interpretations of these rules, the FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock.  Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock. 

Again, the foregoing rules apply to broker/dealers. They do not apply to us in any manner whatsoever. Since our shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers, many broker/dealers may not want to make a market in our shares or conduct any transactions in our shares. As such, your ability to dispose of your shares may be adversely affected. 

b) Blue Sky Restrictions on Resale: If a selling security holder wants to sell shares of our common stock under this registration statement in the United States, the selling security holders will also need to comply with state securities laws, also known as "Blue Sky laws," with regard to secondary sales. All states offer a variety of exemption from registration for secondary sales. Many states, for example, have an exemption for secondary trading of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or for securities of issuers that publish continuous disclosure of financial and non-financial information in a recognized securities manual, such as Standard   Poor's. The broker for a selling security holder will be able to advise a selling security holder which states our common stock is exempt from registration with that state for secondary sales. 

Any person who purchases shares of our common stock from a selling security holder under this registration statement who then wants to sell such shares will also have to comply with Blue Sky laws regarding secondary sales. When the registration statement becomes effective, and a selling security holder indicates in which state(s) he desires to sell his shares, we will be able to identify whether it will need to register or it will rely on an exemption there from. 

Employees 

The Company presently has no employees other than its officer. Management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys, and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees until absolutely necessary for the operations of the Company. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the scope and requirements of the operations of the Company. 

As of December 31, 2014, we had no employees other than our officer and director. We anticipate that we will not hire any employees in the next twelve months, unless we generate significant revenues. 

6 

Facilities  

Our executive, administrative and operating offices are located at 269 Forest Ave, Staten Island, NY 10301. There is no written agreement documenting this arrangement. 

We have no policies with respect to investments in real estate or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages, or securities of or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities. The mailing address of Classic Rules Judo is 430 3 rd  Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215. 

Risk Factors 

Financial position of the Company, working capital deficit; report of independent auditors. The Company has yet to generate revenue from its real estate investment activities. The Company, which is to be considered as a startup Company is currently developing its business and hopes to generate sustainable revenues through investment into specific real estate developments in New York. The Company makes no assurances that the Company will generate sufficient revenues through its operations and be able to continue as a going concern. 

The independent accountant s report on the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Risks of Leverage . The Company has, and likely will continue to, incur substantial borrowings, notes, and/or other Company debt for the purpose of developing Company operations and for financing the expansion and growth of the Company, including the possible acquisition of other companies. Any amounts borrowed will depend among other things, on the condition of financial markets. Acquisitions of equipment, vehicles, or other companies purchased on a leveraged basis generally can be expected to be profitable only if they generate, at a minimum, sufficient cash revenues to pay interest on, and to amortize, the related debt, to cover operating expenses and to recover the equity investment. The use of leverage, under certain circumstances, may provide a higher return to the shareholders but will cause the risk of loss to the shareholders to be greater than if the Company did not borrow, because fixed payment obligations must be met on certain specified dates regardless of the amount of revenues derived by the Company. If debt service payments are not made when due, the Company may sustain the loss of its equity investment in the assets securing the debt as a result of foreclosure by the secured lender.  Interest payable on Company borrowings, if any, may vary with the movement of the interest rates charged by banks to their prime commercial customers. An increase in borrowing costs due to a rise in the  prime  or  base  rates may reduce the amount of Company income and cash availability for dividends.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be part of the ordinary course of our business. At present, there are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. The Company s property is not the subject of any pending legal proceedings.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information 

Our common stock is not currently quoted on any exchange. We intend to apply to have our common stock be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. If our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a security holder may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional stock exchanges in that it (1) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers, and (2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more Broker-dealers rather than the "specialist" common to stock exchanges. 

To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing. If it meets the qualifications for trading securities on the OTC Bulletin Board our securities will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. We may not now or ever qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We currently have no market maker who is willing to list quotations for our securities. 

As of December 7, 2016, there were 69,122,426 shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding. 

Dividends 

It has been the policy of the Company to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of its business.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 7. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

When used in this report on Form 10-K, the words "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "continue," "estimate," "project," "intend," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company's future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and that actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors are discussed under the headings "Item 1. Business" and "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and also include general economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 

8 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such forward-looking statements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results. 

The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, are based on certain assumptions and expectations which may or may not be valid or actually occur, and which involve various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks set forth above. In addition, sales and other revenues may not commence and/or continue as anticipated due to delays or otherwise. As a result, the Company s actual results for future periods could differ materially from those anticipated or projected. 

Overview 

Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. ( We  or the  Company ) was originally formed as Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. a Delaware corporation, on November 16, 2005, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Puritan Financial Group, Inc., a company traded on the Pink OTC Markets, Inc. On March 24, 2008 a majority of the shareholders approved the spin-off of the Company to the shareholders of record as of March, 26, 2008.  Subsequent to its formation and prior to being renamed, the Company had no revenues or operations. 

Our Company, Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. created a subsidiary which was incorporated in the state of Connecticut called Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. There are no other subsidiaries. On July 15, 2008 the Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding entitled  Management's Global Agreement  (the  MOU ) with Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and Mr. Chris Angle.  Under such MOU the Company would change its name and pursue the business of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. 

We intended to establish and promote tournaments for the sport of classical judo and have, so far, done two tournaments, one in 2010 and one in 2011. The Company has not hosted a tournament since 2011 and has since changed its business to real estate investing and development. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of the financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Though the Company evaluates the estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, our actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Certain of the Company's accounting policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and that require management's subjective judgments are described below to facilitate a better understanding of our business activities. Management bases its judgments on its experience and assumptions which it believes are reasonable and applicable under the circumstances. 

Principles of Consolidation  - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Revenue Recognition  - The Company has not yet generated revenues from its planned real estate investment activities.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013  

General and Administrative Expenses . The Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $183,682 during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $41,437 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is related a one time stock based compensation expense of $148,962. 

Operating loss .

Our auditors have raised, in their current audit report, a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will be unable to continue as a going concern if we are not able to raise capital and are unsuccessful in securing a business acquisition. Until such time as sufficient capital is raised, we intend to limit expenditures for capital assets and other expense categories. 

The Company must currently rely on corporate officers, directors and outside investors in order to meet its budget. If the Company is unable to obtain financing from any of one of these aforementioned sources, the Company would not be able to satisfy its financial obligations. Limited commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management and other shareholders. We cannot provide any assurance that any additional funds will be made available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on us.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its subsidiary (collectively, the "Company") as of December 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding this matter are also described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

December 31, 2014 

NOTE A   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS 

Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2005 under the name Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. ( Blue Ribbon ). Blue Ribbon changed its name to Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. ("Classic Rules") on July 15, 2008. Classic Rules formed a subsidiary in the State of Connecticut on August 13, 2008 named Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. to develop an annual judo championship tournament. Collectively the entities are referred to as  the Company . On June 2, 2014, the Company ceased its principal activities of hosting and sponsoring judo tournaments. The Company currently operates in real estate investment activities focused in the New York City metropolitan area. 

NOTE B   GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no revenues, has incurred a net loss of $183,682 for the year ended December 31, 2014, has an accumulated deficit of $311,737 at December 31, 2014, has experienced negative cash flows from operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Management plans to enter to real estate market and has signed an agreement to raise capital to do so. However, the Company needs to raise additional capital in order to fully develop its business plan. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate sales revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurance that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. 

NOTE C   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  The Company had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

NOTE C   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  

Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic No. 825,  Financial Instruments  ( Topic No. 825 ) requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Topic No. 825 defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 the carrying value of the Company s cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and related party payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

Equity-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for equity-based compensation transactions with employees under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 718,  Compensation, Stock Compensation  ( Topic No. 718 ). Topic No. 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net earnings. The fair value of common stock issued for compensation is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of the Company s equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. In addition, the calculation of equity-based compensation costs requires that we estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited during the vesting period.  The fair value of equity-based awards granted to employees is amortized over the vesting period of the award and the Company elects to use the straight-line method for awards granted after adoption of Topic No. 718. 

The Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  ( Topic No. 505-50 ). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.  In general, the Company recognizes an asset or expense in the same manner as if it was to pay cash for the goods or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

NOTE C   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes ( Topic No. 740 ) which requires the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the entire deferred tax asset, which arises from our net operating losses, has been fully reserved because management has determined that it is not more likely than not that the net operating loss carry forwards will be realized in the future. 

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions and records tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and has not accrued any liability for the payment of tax related interest or penalties. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress nor has it had any federal or state tax examinations since inception. 

Subsequent Events  

In accordance with Topic No. 855  Subsequent Events  the Company evaluated subsequent events, which are events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2014 through the date of the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronoucements  

Management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have an effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Advertising Costs  

The Company's policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. 

Net Loss Per Common Share  

The Company computes basic loss per common share by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Common equivalent shares from stock options and other common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation when their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company was in a loss position for all periods presented and, accordingly, there is no difference between basic loss per share and diluted loss per share. 

Reverse Stock Split  

At the Board of Directors meeting on July 15, 2008, the Company approved a resolution to affect a 10 for 1 reverse stock split. All share and per share information were retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

NOTE D   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT

The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.

The acquisition agreement stipulated in the event of nonpayment before September 30, 2014, the escrow agent shall release the shares to the related party in proportion to the amount paid of the Purchase Price with the remainder delivered back to the Company. As the related party company has paid $51,038 of expenses on behalf of the Company, the Company issued 128,700 shares as repayment of advances from the related party company. The remaining 371,300 shares were issued back to the former related party, for which the Company recorded a compensation expense in the amount of $148,962.

NOTE G   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

During the third quarter of 2014, the Company identified fraudulent activities entered into by its former CEO who is also a former member of the Board of Directors. The former officer and director of the Company entered into certain employment agreements and convertible notes payable without the proper authorization of the Company or other members of its Board of Directors. The employment agreements and convertible notes payable were entered into during the three months ended June 30, 2014. The Company assessed its potential responsibility for these liabilities entered into and determined it to be remote due to the former officer not having received approval from the Company board of directors to enter into such transactions and the employment agreements and notes being entered into through a fictitious entity with which the Company has no previous or current affiliation with. As such, the impacts of these agreements are not reflected in these financial statements. 

NOTE H   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby it will issue up to 50,000,000 shares of restricted common stock for $0.01 cash per share representing total cash proceeds of up to $500,000.

In November 2015, certain shareholders of the Company expressed dissatisfaction. While no legal action was taken by the shareholders, the Company deemed it was in its best interest to settle with the shareholders by issuing a total of 165,480 shares of common stock. 

Additionally, on November 4, 2015, the Company issued a total of 34,520 shares of common stock for professional services performed related to settling with the dissatisfied shareholders.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term "disclosure controls and procedures" to mean a company's controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its chief executive and chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to its chief executive and chief financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. 

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and l5d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company's internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

25 

Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based upon the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically management identified the following material weaknesses at December 31, 2014: 

As of December 31, 2014, there was a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) in the US and the financial reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

As of December 31, 2014, there were insufficient written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

As of December 31, 2014, there was a lack of segregation of duties, in that we only had one person performing all accounting-related duties. 

As of December 31, 2014, there were no independent directors and no independent audit committee. 

As a result of the material weakness described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting, involving the preparation and reporting of our financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP, were not effective. 

We understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls is a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when practical and necessary. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.
