           1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The condensed consolidated financial statements as of   October 1, 2016   and for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income, statement of stockholders' equity, and statements of cash flows of Motorola Solutions, Inc. ( Motorola Solutions  or the  Company ) for all periods presented. 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year.  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Recent Developments 
  On February 19, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Guardian Digital Communications Limited ("GDCL"), a holding company of Airwave Solutions Limited ("Airwave"), the largest private operator of a public safety network in the world. All of the outstanding equity of GDCL was acquired for the sum of    1  , after which the Company invested into GDCL    698 million  , net of cash acquired, or approximately   $1.0 billion  , to settle all third party debt. The Company will make a deferred cash payment of    64 million   on November 15, 2018. The Company funded the investment with a   $675 million   term loan (the  Term Loan ) and approximately   $400 million   of international cash on hand. The acquisition has been reported within our Services segment, enabling the Company to geographically diversify its global Managed   Support services offerings, while offering a proven service delivery platform to build on for providing innovative, leading, mission-critical communications solutions and services to customers. See discussion in Note 14.  
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , Motorola Solutions relocated its global headquarters from Schaumburg, IL to Chicago, IL. The move provides the Company with access to key talent and allows the Company to optimize the Schaumburg campus for current space requirements.  
  On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Spillman Technologies, a provider of comprehensive law enforcement and public safety software solutions. The acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, will expand the Company's smart public safety portfolio and will enable the Company to offer a full suite of command center solutions to a broader customer base. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount it expects to receive for those goods and services. This ASU requires additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and estimates and changes in those estimates. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date" that delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to January 1, 2018, as the Company s annual reporting period begins after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)" which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. In April of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, non-cash consideration, and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP. In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria. The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption it will elect and is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  
  
   6 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period. The ASU requires a modified retrospective method upon adoption. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so for which it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. Upon adoption, the Company does not anticipate significant changes to the Company's existing accounting policies or presentation of the Statement of Cash Flows.  
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory,  as part of the Board s simplification initiative aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. This ASU eliminates the current application of deferring the income tax effect of intra-entity asset transfers, other than inventory, until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use and will require entities to recognize tax expense when the transfer occurs. The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period; early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a modified retrospective application with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  The Company elected to adopt ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  as of January 1, 2016. ASU 2016-09, which was issued by the FASB in March 2016, simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The impact of the prospective adoption of the provisions related to the recognition of excess tax benefits in income tax expense was a   $5 million   income tax benefit during the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  . Additionally, as a result of the adoption of this accounting standard, excess tax benefits on share-based compensation have been reported as a component of operating cash rather than within financing cash flows as previously presented, while the payment of withholding taxes on the settlement of share-based awards has been reported as a component of financing cash flows rather than within operating cash flows as previously presented. The change in presentation of withholding taxes within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows has been adopted retrospectively, thereby increasing operating cash flows and reducing financing cash flows by   $16 million   for both the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . The presentation of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation has been adjusted prospectively within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, increasing operating cash flow and decreasing financing cash flow by   $5 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  . 
  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03, "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," effective January 1, 2016. Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are required to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this guidance. We have retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016. As a result, debt issuance costs which were previously capitalized in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet have been presented as a reduction to long-term debt. As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $31 million   and   $41 million  , respectively, have been presented as a component of long-term debt. 

2. 
    Discontinued Operations 
     On October 27, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its Enterprise business to Zebra Technologies Corporation for   $3.45 billion   in cash. Certain assets of the Enterprise business were excluded from the transaction and retained by the Company, including the Company s iDEN business. The historical financial results of the Enterprise business, excluding those assets and liabilities retained in the transaction, are reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company had   no   earnings from discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the   three and nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , the Company recorded losses from discontinued operations of   $11 million   and   $32 million  , respectively.

Earnings Per Common Share 
  The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows:   

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share from both continuing operations and on a net earnings basis for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , the assumed exercise of   2.5 million   options were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the assumed exercise of   2.9 million   options and the assumed vesting of   0.4 million   restricted stock units ("RSUs") were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.  
  For the   three months ended     October 3, 2015  , the assumed exercise of   3.9 million   stock options were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , the assumed exercise of   2.6 million   options and the assumed vesting of   0.4 million   RSUs were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.  
  On August 25, 2015, the Company issued   $1.0 billion   of   2%   Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020 (the "Senior Convertible Notes"). The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of   14.5985   per   $1,000   principal amount (which is equal to an initial conversion price of   $68.50   per share). In the event of conversion, the Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash. 
  
   9 

Because of the Company s intention to settle the par value of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion, Motorola Solutions does not reflect any shares underlying the Senior Convertible Notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeds the conversion price. In this case, only the number of shares that would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution) will be included, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion price of   $68.50  . For the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the dilutive impact of the Senior Convertible Notes was   0.9 million   shares and   0.5 million   shares, respectively.

  On February 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Penang, Malaysia manufacturing operations, including the land, building, equipment, and inventory, as well as the transfer of employees to a contract manufacturer. During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company incurred a loss of   $7 million   on the sale of its Penang, Malaysia facility and manufacturing operations, which is included within Gains (losses) on sales of investments and businesses, net.

A building impairment loss of   $17 million   has been recognized in Other charges during the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   related to the excess carrying value of the long-lived assets in relation to the selling price.  
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , Motorola Solutions relocated its global headquarters from Schaumburg, IL to Chicago, IL. The move provides the Company with access to key talent and allows the Company to optimize the Schaumburg campus for current space requirements.

Under this guidance, the Company has revised the presentation of debt issuance costs which were previously capitalized in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet to be presented as a reduction to long-term debt. As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $31 million   and   $41 million  , respectively, have been reclassified to be presented as a component of long-term debt.

  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling   $744 million  , compared to   $494 million   outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . The Company does not believe these financial instruments should subject it to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions. 
  The following table shows the five largest net notional amounts of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of   October 1, 2016  , and the corresponding positions as of   December 31, 2015  :  

Interest Rate Risk 
  One of the Company s European subsidiaries has Euro-denominated loans. The interest on the Euro-denominated loans is variable. The Company has interest rate swap agreements in place which change the characteristics of interest rate payments from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The interest rate swaps are not designated as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in Other income (expense) in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the interest rate swap was in a liability position of   $1 million   at both   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its Term Loan which has a variable interest rate that is indexed to LIBOR.   
  Counterparty Risk 
  The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties. However, the Company s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. As of   October 1, 2016  , all of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings. As of   October 1, 2016  , the aggregate net credit risk with all counterparties was   de minimus  .

The Company had no instruments designated as hedging instruments for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  .  

6. 
    Income Taxes 
     At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company makes an estimate of its annual effective income tax rate. Tax expense in interim periods is calculated at the estimated annual effective tax rate plus or minus the tax effects of items of income and expense that are discrete to the period. The estimate used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis may change in subsequent interim periods. 
  The following table provides details of income taxes:   

  The Company recorded   $100 million   of net tax expense in the   third   quarter of   2016   resulting in an effective tax rate of   34%  , compared to   $71 million   of net tax expense in the   third   quarter of   2015   resulting in an effective tax rate of   36%  . The effective tax rate in the   third   quarter of   2016   was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   partly due to favorable discrete adjustments to deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate in the   third   quarter of   2015   was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   primarily due to higher income in the U.S. relative to foreign operations.  
  
   16 

The Company recorded   $164 million   of net tax expense in the   first nine months   of   2016   resulting in an effective tax rate of   34%  , compared to   $175 million   of net tax expense resulting in an effective tax rate of   32%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   first nine months   of   2016   was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   partly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. The effective tax rate in the   first nine months   of   2015   was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   primarily due to the rate differential for foreign affiliates and the U.S. domestic production tax deduction. 

7. 
    Retirement and Other Employee Benefits 
     Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans   
  The net periodic costs (benefits) for Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans were as follows: 

The Company made   no   contributions to its U.S. Pension Benefit Plans during both the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . The Company made   $2 million   of contributions to its Non U.S. Pension Benefit Plans during both the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . 

The Company made   $2 million   of contributions to its U.S. Pension Benefit Plans during the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   no   contributions to its U.S. Pension Benefit Plans during the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  . During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the Company made   $7 million   and   $8 million   of contributions to its Non U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, respectively. 
  During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company made an amendment to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan (the  Amendment ). As a result of the Amendment, all eligible retirees under the age of   65   will be provided an annual subsidy per household, versus per individual, toward the purchase of their own health care coverage from private insurance companies and for the reimbursement of eligible health care expenses.  
  The Amendment to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan required a remeasurement of the plan, resulting in a   $53 million   reduction in the accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation. A substantial portion of the decrease is related to a prior service credit and will be recognized as a credit to the condensed consolidated statements of operations over approximately   five   years, or the period in which the remaining employees eligible for the plan will qualify for benefits under the plan. 
  During the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , the Company amended its Non U.S. defined benefit plan within the United Kingdom by closing future benefit accruals to all participants effective December 31, 2015.  As a result, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of   $32 million   to Other charges in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  
   17 

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed the method used to estimate the interest and service cost components of net periodic cost for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Historically, the interest and service cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest and service costs. This change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations as the change in interest and service cost is completely offset in the actuarial loss reported in the period. The Company has concluded that this change is a change in estimate and, therefore, has accounted for it prospectively beginning January 1, 2016. Based on the change in estimate, the Company experienced   no   reduction in service costs and a   $21 million   reduction in interest costs for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the prior approach. The overall reduction in the interest cost for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   is comprised of   $14 million   related to the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans,   $3 million   related to the Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plans, and   $4 million   related to the Non U.S. Pension Benefits Plan. 

8. 
    Share-Based Compensation Plans 
     Compensation expense for the Company s share-based compensation plans was as follows:  

During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company granted   0.7 million   RSUs and market stock units ("MSUs") and   0.7 million   stock options and performance options ("POs"). The total aggregate compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for these RSUs and MSUs was   $42 million   and stock options and POs was   $10 million  , respectively, which will generally be recognized over the vesting period of three years. 

9. 
    Fair Value Measurements 
     The Company holds certain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Fair value is measured using the fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies as defined in the authoritative literature. This guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about current market conditions.  
  The fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows:  
  Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
  Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. 
  Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

The fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities by level in the fair value hierarchy as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Legal Matters 
  The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition. 
  Other Indemnifications 
  The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company. 
  Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of the Company's assets or businesses and require the Company to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. The Company's obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration and to amounts not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. The Company had   no   accruals for any such obligations at   October 1, 2016  . 
  In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements.

    Reorganization of Business 
     2016   Charges 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $7 million   including   $6 million   of charges in Other charges and   $1 million   of charges in Cost of sales in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $7 million   were charges of   $8 million   related to employee separation costs, partially offset by   $1 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed. 
  During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $74 million   including   $48 million   of charges in Other charges and   $26 million   of charges in Cost of sales in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $74 million   were charges of: (i)   $54 million   for employee separation costs, (ii)   $20 million   for impairments, including   $17 million   for a building impairment and   $3 million   for the impairment of the corporate aircraft, and (iii)   $5 million   for exit costs, partially offset by   $5 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

The following table displays the net charges incurred by segment:  

The following table displays a rollforward of the reorganization of business accruals established for lease exit costs and employee separation costs from   January 1, 2016   to   October 1, 2016  : 

Exit Costs 
  At   January 1, 2016  , the Company had   $9 million   of accruals for exit costs. During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , there were   $5 million   of additional charges and   $5 million   of cash payments related to the exit of leased facilities. The remaining accrual of   $9 million  , which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets at   October 1, 2016  , primarily represents future cash payments for lease obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years. 
  Employee Separation Costs 
  At   January 1, 2016  , the Company had an accrual of   $51 million   for employee separation costs. The   2016   additional charges of   $54 million   represent severance costs for approximately   600   employees. The adjustment of   $5 million   reflects reversals for accruals no longer needed. The   $54 million   used reflects cash payments to severed employees. The remaining accrual of   $46 million  , which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets at   October 1, 2016  , is expected to be paid, primarily within one year, to approximately   500   employees, who have either been severed or have been notified of their severance and have begun or will begin receiving payments. 
  2015   Charges 
  During the   three months ended     October 3, 2015  , the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $41 million   including   $40 million   of charges in Other charges and   $1 million   of charges in Cost of sales in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $41 million   were charges of: (i)   $26 million   for the impairment of corporate aircraft, (ii)   $11 million   of charges related to employee separation costs, and (iii) a   $6 million   building impairment charge, partially offset by   $2 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed. 
  During the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $70 million   including   $65 million   of charges in Other charges and   $5 million   of charges in Cost of sales in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $70 million   were charges of: (i)   $36 million   related to employee separation costs, (ii)   $26 million   for the impairment of the corporate aircraft, (iii) a   $6 million   building impairment charge, and (iv)   $4 million   for exit costs, partially offset by   $2 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

    Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
     Acquisitions 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company completed the acquisitions of   two   providers of public safety software-based solutions for an aggregate purchase price of   $50 million  , recognizing an additional   $31 million   of goodwill,   $22 million   of identifiable intangible assets, and   $3 million   of acquired liabilities related to these acquisitions. The   $22 million   of  
  
   22 

identifiable intangible assets were classified as: (i)   $11 million   of completed technology, (ii)   $8 million   of customer-related, and (iii)   $3 million   of other intangibles. These intangible assets will be amortized over periods ranging from   five   to   ten   years. The results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions are not significant individually or in the aggregate. 
  On February 19, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of GDCL, a holding company of Airwave, the largest private operator of a public safety network in the world. All of the outstanding equity of GDCL was acquired for the sum of    1  , after which the Company invested into GDCL    698 million  , net of cash acquired, or approximately   $1.0 billion  , to settle all third party debt. The Company will make a deferred cash payment of    64 million   on November 15, 2018.  
  The acquisition of GDCL enables the Company to geographically diversify its global Managed   Support services offerings, while offering a proven service delivery platform to build on for providing innovative, leading, mission-critical communications solutions and services to customers. During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company recorded   $338 million   within Net sales and   $71 million   within Net earnings from the operations of Airwave. 
  The acquisition of GDCL has been accounted for at fair value as of the acquisition date, based on the fair value of the total consideration transferred which has been attributed to all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and measured at fair value.  
  The total consideration for the acquisition of GDCL was approximately   $1.1 billion  , consisting of cash payments of   $1.0 billion  , net of cash acquired, and deferred consideration valued at fair value on the date of the acquisition of   $82 million  . The fair value of deferred consideration has been determined based on its net present value, calculated using a discount rate of   4.2%  , which is reflective of the credit standing of the combined entity. The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the February 19, 2016 acquisition date: 

Acquired intangible assets consist of   $846 million   of customer relationships and   $29 million   of trade names. All intangibles have a useful life of   seven   years, over which amortization expense will be recognized on a straight line basis.  
  The fair values of trade names and customer relationships were estimated using the income approach. Customer relationships were valued under the excess earnings method which assumes that the value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable specifically to the intangible asset. Trade names were valued under the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. 
  The fair value of acquired Property, plant and equipment, primarily network-related assets, was valued under the replacement cost method, which determines fair value based on the replacement cost of new property with similar capacity, adjusted for physical deterioration over the remaining useful life. 
  Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
   On August 9, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of a provider of communications systems support and two-way radios, for a gross purchase price of   $6 million  , recognizing   $5 million   of identifiable intangible assets, which will be amortized over a period of   five   years. The results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the acquisition date. 
  On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Spillman Technologies, a provider of comprehensive law enforcement and public safety software solutions. The acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth

quarter of 2016, will expand the Company's smart public safety portfolio and will enable the Company to offer a full suite of command center solutions to a broader customer base. 
  Pro Forma Financial Information 
  The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company and GDCL for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   as if the acquisition of GDCL had occurred on January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2015, respectively, (in millions, except per share amounts): 

The Company did not adjust the effects of an   $884 million   goodwill impairment charge reported in the historic results of GDCL for the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015   on the basis that the goodwill impairment charge was not directly attributable to the acquisition of GDCL by the Company. However, this goodwill impairment charge should be highlighted as unusual and non-recurring. 
  The pro forma results are based on estimates and assumptions, which the Company believes are reasonable. They are not necessarily indicative of its consolidated results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation, interest expense, and transaction costs expensed during the period.  
  Intangible Assets 
  Amortized intangible assets were comprised of the following:  

Amortization expense on intangible assets was   $31 million   for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   $83 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  . Amortization expense on intangible assets was   $2 million   for the   three months ended     October 3, 2015   and   $6 million   for the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  . The increase in amortization expense is due to the acquisition of GDCL.

  Executive Overview 
  Recent Developments 
  On February 19, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Guardian Digital Communications Limited ("GDCL"), a holding company of Airwave Solutions Limited ("Airwave"), the largest private operator of a public safety network in the world. All of the outstanding equity of GDCL was acquired for the sum of  1, after which we invested into GDCL  698 million, net of cash acquired, or approximately $1.0 billion, to settle all third party debt. We will make a deferred cash payment of  64 million on November 15, 2018. We funded the investment with a $675 million term loan (the  Term Loan ) and approximately $400 million of international cash on hand. The acquisition of GDCL enables us to geographically diversify our global Managed   Support services offerings, while offering a proven service delivery platform to build on for providing innovative, leading, mission-critical communications solutions and services to customers. 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , we relocated our global headquarters from Schaumburg, IL to Chicago, IL. The move provides us with access to key talent and allows the Company to optimize the Schaumburg campus for current space requirements. 
  On September 23, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Spillman Technologies, a provider of comprehensive law enforcement and public safety software solutions. The acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, will expand our smart public safety portfolio and enables us to offer a full suite of command center solutions to a broader customer base. 
  Our Business 
  We are a leading global provider of mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software, and services. Our products and services help government, public safety and commercial customers improve their operations through increased effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of their mobile workforces. We serve our customers with a global footprint of sales in more than 100 countries and   13,000   employees worldwide, based on our industry leading innovation and a deep portfolio of products and services. 
  We conduct our business globally and manage it by two segments: 
  Products:     The Products segment is comprised of Devices and Systems. Devices includes two-way portable and vehicle mounted radios, accessories, and software features and upgrades. Systems includes the radio network core and central processing software, base stations, consoles, repeaters, and software applications and features. The primary customers of the Products segment are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers who operate private communications networks and manage a mobile workforce. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the segment s net sales were   $920 million  , representing   60%   of our consolidated net sales. 
  Services:   The Services segment provides a full set of service offerings for government, public safety, and commercial communication networks including: (i) Integration services, (ii) Managed   Support services, and (iii) iDEN services. Integration services includes the implementation, optimization, and integration of systems, devices, software, and applications. Managed   Support services includes a continuum of service offerings beginning with repair, technical support, and hardware maintenance. More advanced offerings include network monitoring, software maintenance, and cyber security services. Managed service offerings range from partial or full operation of customer owned networks to operation of Motorola Solutions owned networks. Services are provided across all radio network technologies, Command Center Consoles, and Smart Public Safety Solutions. iDEN services consists primarily of hardware and software maintenance services for our legacy iDEN customers. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the segment s net sales were   $612 million  , representing   40%   of our consolidated net sales. 
  Trends Affecting Our Business  
  Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions:     The stronger U.S. dollar and weakening economic conditions have had a negative impact on sales, particularly in Latin America, parts of Europe, and China. Additionally, the strengthening dollar has reduced the purchasing power of our customers, and economic challenges have negatively impacted government budgets and funds available for the purchase of our products in these regions. 
  The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on net earnings is partially mitigated by the following: (i) the majority of our revenues are derived from contracts within North America denominated in U.S. dollars, (ii) the cost of sales for the delivery of our Services offerings are predominately labor costs incurred within the same geographic region as the associated sales, resulting in minimal impact of foreign exchange rates on gross margin within the Services segment, and (iii) a significant portion  
  
   26 

of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies as a result of our offshore research and development ("R D") and selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") footprint. 
  Cost Savings Initiatives:     We are committed to employing disciplined financial policies and driving continuous efficiencies and improvements in our cost structure. We expect to reduce SG A and R D expenses during   2016   by approximately   $120 million   in comparison to   2015  , excluding incremental operating expenses from acquisitions in the second half of the year. In the   first nine months   of   2016  , we realized   $97 million   of SG A and R D cost savings.  
  Growth of Our Services Portfolio:     Our Services segment is expected to grow at a higher rate than our Products segment. Overall, the Services segment has a lower gross margin percentage than the Products segment, but we expect consolidated operating margins to continue to expand. During the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , we grew our net sales within the Services segment by   23%   and   18%  , respectively, inclusive of the acquisition of GDCL, compared to the   three and nine months ended     October 3, 2015  . 
  iDEN:     We have experienced a downward trend in iDEN product and services sales over recent years due to decreased demand as a result of the dated nature of the technology. We expect the downward trend to continue as service contracts expire and new technology replaces iDEN equipment in the marketplace. This trend primarily relates to our Services segment as the majority of iDEN sales are hardware and software maintenance services. The expected decline in iDEN sales will impact both revenues and gross margins within the Services segment as iDEN services  gross margins are generally higher than the remainder of our services portfolio.  
  Third   Quarter Summary 
              
    We generated operating earnings of   $341 million  , or   22%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $231 million  , or   16%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Profitability   increased   primarily as a result of: (i) higher revenue and gross margin percentage in the Services segment and (ii) lower operating expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. 
                
    We had earnings from continuing operations attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of   $192 million  , or   $1.13   per diluted common share, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $126 million  , or   $0.63   per diluted common share, in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
                 
    We returned   $941 million   in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the   first nine months   of   2016  . 
                
    We announced the acquisition of Spillman Technologies, a provider of comprehensive law enforcement and public safety software solutions. The acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, will expand our smart public safety portfolio and will enable us to offer a full suite of command center solutions to a broader customer base. 
                
    We announced the increase of our quarterly dividend by 15 percent to $0.47 per share.  
     A summary of our segment results is as follows: 
             
    Products:   Net sales were   $920 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $5 million  , or   1%   compared to net sales of   $925 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . On a geographic basis, net sales   decreased   in Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America, and Asia Pacific ("AP), and increased in North America, compared to the year-ago quarter. 
                
    Services:   Net sales were   $612 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $115 million  , or   23%   compared to net sales of   $497 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . On a geographic basis, net sales   increased   in EMEA, AP, and North America, and decreased in Latin America, compared to the year-ago quarter.

Results of Operations   Three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to   three months ended     October 3, 2015    
  The results of operations for the   third   quarter of   2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers. 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales were   $1.5 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   $110 million  , or   8%  ,   increase   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   increase   in net sales is reflective of growth in EMEA, North America, and AP, partially offset by a decrease in Latin America. The increase in EMEA was due to growth in Services sales, primarily due to the acquisition of GDCL which provided   $131 million   of net sales within the quarter, partially offset by lower Products sales. The increase in North America was due to higher sales in both the Products and Services segments. The increase in AP was due to growth in Services sales, partially offset by lower Products sales. The decrease in Latin America was the result of lower Products and Services sales primarily due to continued macroeconomic pressures.  
  Gross Margin  
  Gross margin was   $762 million  , or   49.7%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $685 million  , or   48.2%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   increase   in gross margin percentage was driven primarily by an increase in the margins within the Services segment while the Products segment decreased slightly. The increase in gross margin percentage in the Services segment was driven by the expansion of our Managed   Support services portfolio, primarily due to the acquisition of GDCL, which historically has had higher margins than our legacy portfolio.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  SG A expenses   decreased     5%   to   $247 million  , or   16.1%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $259 million  , or   18.2%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   decrease   in SG A expenditures is primarily due to cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions. 
  Research and Development Expenditures 
  R D expenditures   decreased     10%   to   $137 million  , or   8.9%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $153 million  , or   10.8%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   decrease   in R D expenditures is primarily due to cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions. 
  Other Charges 
  We recorded net charges of   $37 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to net charges of   $42 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net Other charges in the   third   quarter of   2016   included: (i)   $31 million   of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles and (ii)   $6 million   of net reorganization of business charges. The net charges in the   third   quarter of   2015   of   $42 million   included: (i)   $40 million   of net reorganization of business charges, including a   $26 million   impairment of the corporate aircraft and a   $6 million   building impairment charge, and (ii)   $2 million   of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles. The net reorganization of business charges are discussed in further detail in the  Reorganization of Businesses  section. 
  Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense was   $54 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $43 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase in net interest expense in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   was a result of higher outstanding debt balances and lower cash balances. 
  Gains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net 
  Net gains on sales of investments and businesses were   $7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $10 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net gains in the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015   were related to the sales of equity investments. 
  Other 
  Net Other   expense   was   $1 million   in both the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  . The net Other   expense   in the   third   quarter of   2016   was comprised of: (i) an   $11 million     loss   on derivative investments and (ii) a   $2 million   investment impairment, partially offset by: (i) a   $7 million   foreign currency   gain   and (ii)   $5 million   of other non-operating   gains  . The net Other   expense   in the   third   quarter of   2015   was comprised of a   $29 million   foreign currency   loss  , partially offset by: (i) a   $25 million     gain   on derivative instruments, (ii) a   $2 million   gain on equity method investments, and (iii)   $1 million   of other non-operating   gains  . 
  Effective Tax Rate 
  We recorded   $100 million   of net tax expense in the   third   quarter of   2016  , resulting in an effective tax rate of   34%  , compared to   $71 million   of net tax expense in the   third   quarter of   2015  , resulting in an effective tax rate of   36%  . Our effective tax rate in the   third   quarter of   2016   was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   partly due to favorable discrete adjustments to deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate in the   third   quarter of   2015   was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   primarily due to higher income in the U.S. relative to foreign operations.

Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. 
  After taxes, we had earnings from continuing operations attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of   $192 million  , or   $1.13   per diluted share, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to earnings from continuing operations attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of   $126 million  , or   $0.63   per diluted share, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  The   increase   in earnings from continuing operations in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , was primarily driven by: (i) a   $77 million   increase in Gross margin largely driven by our Managed   Support services in EMEA, primarily due to the acquisition of GDCL, (ii) a   $16 million   decrease in R D expenses, and (iii) a   $12 million     decrease   in SG A spend. The   increase   in earnings from continuing operations per diluted share was driven by an   increase   in earnings from continuing operations and lower shares outstanding as a result of repurchases made through our ongoing share repurchase program. 
  Earnings from Discontinued Operations 
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we reported   no   earnings from discontinued operations, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of   $11 million  , or   $0.06   per diluted share, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 

Results of Operations   Nine months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     October 3, 2015    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales were   $4.2 billion   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , a   $142 million  , or   4%     increase   from the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   increase   in net sales is reflective of growth in EMEA and North America, partially offset by decreases in Latin America and AP. EMEA grew on Services sales, partially offset by lower Products sales. The increase in EMEA Services sales was due to an increase in Managed and Support services, primarily due to the acquisition of GDCL which provided   $338 million   of net sales during the   first nine months   of   2016  . North America grew on both Services and Products sales. The decrease in Latin America was the result of lower Products and Services sales primarily due to macroeconomic pressures. The decrease in AP was due to lower Products sales, primarily in China, partially offset by growth in the Services segment.  
  Gross Margin  
  Gross margin was   $1.9 billion  , or   46.7%   of net sales, in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $1.9 billion  , or   46.9%   of net sales, in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   decrease   in gross margin percentage was driven by the Products segment while the gross margin percentage of the Services segment increased. The decrease in gross margin percentage in the Products segment was primarily driven by: (i) a decrease in volume and (ii) lower margins on global systems sales. The Services segment gross margin percentage improved with the expansion of our Managed   Support services portfolio, primarily due to the acquisition of GDCL, which historically has had higher margins than our legacy portfolio. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  SG A expenses   decreased     $47 million   to   $722 million  , or   17.4%   of net sales, in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $769 million  , or   19.2%   of net sales, in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   decrease   in SG A expenditures is primarily due to: (i) cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions, and (ii) lower pension expenses.  
  Research and Development Expenses 
  R D expenditures   decreased     $57 million   to   $411 million  , or   9.9%   of net sales, in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $468 million  , or   11.7%   of net sales, in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   decrease   in R D expenditures is primarily due to cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions. 
  Other Charges  
  We recorded net charges of   $144 million   in Other charges in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to net charges of   $39 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The net charges in the   first nine months   of   2016   included: (i)   $83 million   of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, (ii)   $48 million   of net reorganization of business charges, including a   $17 million   building impairment and a   $3 million   impairment of the corporate aircraft, and (iii)   $13 million   of transaction fees on the acquisition of GDCL. The net Other charges in the   first nine months   of   2015   of   $39 million   included: (i)   $65 million   of net reorganization of business charges, including a   $26 million   impairment of the corporate aircraft and a   $6 million   building impairment charge, and (ii)   $6 million   of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, partially offset by a   $32 million   gain related to the curtailment of a non-U.S. pension plan. The net reorganization of business charges are discussed in further detail in the  Reorganization of Business  section.

Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense was   $157 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   and   $122 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The increase in net interest expense in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015   was a result of higher outstanding debt balances and lower cash balances. 
  Gains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net 
  Net losses on sales of investments and businesses were   $13 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to net gains on sales of investments and businesses of   $60 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The net losses in the   first nine months   of   2016   consisted of: (i) a   $19 million   loss on the sale of an investment in United Kingdom treasury securities and (ii) a   $7 million   loss from the sale of our Malaysia manufacturing operations, partially offset by     $13 million   of gains on the sales of equity investments. The net gain in the   first nine months   of   2015   consisted of gains on the sales of equity investments.  
  Other 
  Net Other   expense   was   $12 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to net Other   expense   of   $3 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The net Other   expense   in the   first nine months   of   2016   was comprised of: (i) a   $41 million     loss   on derivative instruments, (ii) a   $10 million   foreign currency loss on currency purchased and held in anticipation of the acquisition of GDCL, and (iii) a   $2 million   investment impairment, partially offset by: (i) a   $34 million   foreign currency   gain  , (ii) a   $2 million     gain   on equity method investments, and (iii)   $5 million   of other non-operating   gains  . The net Other   expense   in the   first nine months   of   2015   was comprised of: (i) a   $23 million   foreign currency   loss   and (ii) a   $3 million   investment impairment, partially offset by: (i) a   $13 million     gain   on derivative instruments, (ii) a   $6 million   gain on equity method investments, and (iii)   $4 million   of other non-operating   gains  . 
  Effective Tax Rate 
  We recorded   $164 million   of net tax expense in the   first nine months   of   2016  , resulting in an effective tax rate of   34%  , compared to   $175 million   of net tax expense, resulting in an effective tax rate of   32%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . Our effective tax rate in   2016   was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   partly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Our effective tax rate in the   first nine months   of   2015   was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of   35%   primarily due to the rate differential for foreign affiliates and the U.S. domestic production tax deduction. 
  Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. 
  After taxes, we had earnings from continuing operations attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of   $317 million  , or   $1.82   per diluted share, in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to earnings from continuing operations attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of   $363 million  , or   $1.74   per diluted share, in the   first nine months   of   2015  .   
  The decrease in earnings from continuing operations in the   first nine months   of   2016  , as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , was primarily driven by: (i) a   $105 million   increase in Other charges and (ii) a   $73 million   decrease in Gains (losses) on sales of investments and businesses, partially offset by: (i) a   $60 million   overall increase in Gross margin, (ii) a   $57 million   decrease in R D expenses, and (iii) a   $47 million   decrease in SG A spend. The increase in earnings from continuing operations per diluted share was driven by lower shares outstanding as a result of repurchases made through our ongoing share repurchase program. 
  Loss from Discontinued Operations 
  In the   first nine months   of   2016  , we reported   no   earnings from discontinued operations, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of   $32 million  , or   $0.16   per diluted share, in the   first nine months   of   2015  .   

Segment Information 
  The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reporting segment for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , as detailed in Note 12,  Segment Information,  of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Products Segment 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the segment s net sales represented   60%   of our consolidated net sales, compared to   65%   of our consolidated net sales for the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , the segment's net sales represented   58%   of our consolidated net sales, compared to   64%   of our consolidated net sales for the   third   quarter of   2015  .

Three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to   three months ended     October 3, 2015    
  The segment s net sales   decreased     $5 million  , or   1%  , to   $920 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $925 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   decrease   in the segment's net sales was primarily driven by a decrease in devices sales in EMEA. On a geographic basis, net sales   decreased   in EMEA, Latin America, and AP, and increased in North America for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
  Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment s business, accounting for approximately   70%   of the segment s net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up from   66%   of the segment s net sales in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  The segment had operating earnings of   $225 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $178 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   increase   in operating earnings was primarily driven by: (i) a decrease in Other charges as a result of an   $18 million   impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the corporate aircraft and (ii) lower SG A and R D expenditures as a result of cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions. 
  Nine months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     October 3, 2015    
  The segment s net sales   decreased     $127 million  , or   5%  , to   $2.4 billion   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , as compared to   $2.6 billion   during the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   decrease   in the segment's net sales was primarily driven by: (i) lower volume including decreased devices sales outside of North America and a decrease in global systems sales, (ii) decreases in both devices and systems sales in Latin America primarily due to macroeconomic conditions, and (iii) unfavorable foreign exchange rates with a strengthening U.S. dollar in EMEA, Latin America, and AP. On a geographic basis, net sales   decreased   in EMEA, Latin America, and AP, and increased in North America for the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  .  
  Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment s business, accounting for approximately   70%   of the segment s net sales in the   first nine months   of   2016  , up from   65%   of the segment's net sales in the   first nine months   of   2015  . 
  The segment had operating earnings of   $404 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $413 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   decrease   in operating earnings in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , was primarily driven by: (i) lower volume of devices and systems sales and (ii) an increase in Other charges, partially offset by: (i) lower SG A expenditures as a result of cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions, and lower pension expenses and (ii) lower R D expenditures as a result of cost savings initiatives, including headcount reductions. 
  Services Segment 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the segment s net sales represented   40%   of our consolidated net sales, compared to   35%   of our consolidated net sales for the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , the segment s net sales represented   42%   of our consolidated net sales, compared to   36%   of our consolidated net sales for the   third   quarter of   2015  .    

  Three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to   three months ended     October 3, 2015    
  The segment s net sales   increased     $115 million  , or   23%  , to   $612 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $497 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   increase   in the segment's net sales was primarily driven by higher Managed   Support services sales from both the GDCL acquisition as well as organic growth. The acquisition of GDCL provided   $131 million   of net sales within EMEA during the quarter, while the organic Managed   Support services business grew in North America, AP, and Latin America. This sales growth was partially offset by: (i) a decrease in Integration services sales, primarily in EMEA related to the winding down of a large system implementation, and (ii) declining iDEN services sales in Latin America. On a geographic basis, net sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased in EMEA, AP, and North America, and decreased in Latin America, compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
  Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment s business, accounting for approximately   52%   of the segment s net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   63%   of the segment s net sales in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  The segment had operating earnings of   $116 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $53 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   increase   in operating earnings in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   was primarily driven by increased sales volume generating higher gross margin on our Managed   Support services, primarily due to the GDCL acquisition, partially offset by an increase in Other charges, including   $29 million   of intangible amortization expense associated with the GDCL acquisition. 
  
   32 

Nine months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     October 3, 2015    
  The segment s net sales   increased     $269 million  , or   18%  , to   $1.7 billion   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , as compared to net sales of   $1.5 billion   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   increase   in the segment's net sales was primarily driven by higher Managed   Support services sales from both the acquisition of GDCL as well as organic growth. The acquisition of GDCL provided   $338 million   of net sales within EMEA during the   first nine months   of   2016  , while the organic Managed   Support services business grew in North America and AP. This sales growth was partially offset by: (i) a decrease in Integration services sales, with a significant decrease in EMEA related to the winding down of a large system implementation, (ii) declining iDEN services sales in Latin America, and (iii) the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates with a strengthening U.S. dollar in EMEA, Latin America, and AP. On a geographic basis, net sales for the   first nine months   of   2016   increased in EMEA, AP, and North America, and decreased and Latin America, compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  .  
  Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment s business, accounting for approximately   53%   of the segment s net sales in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   62%   of the segment s net sales in the   first nine months   of   2015  . 
  The segment had operating earnings of   $260 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to operating earnings of   $192 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   increase   in operating earnings in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015   was driven by increased sales volume generating higher gross margin on our Managed   Support services, primarily in EMEA, partially offset by an increase in Other charges, including   $77 million   of intangible amortization expense associated with the GDCL acquisition. 

Reorganization of Business 
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $7 million   including   $6 million   of charges recorded within Other charges and   $1 million   in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Included in the   $7 million   were charges of   $8 million   related to employee separation costs, partially offset by   $1 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed. 
  During the   first nine months   of   2016  , we implemented various productivity improvement plans aimed at continuing operating margin improvements by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. During the   first nine months   of   2016  , we recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $74 million   including charges of   $48 million   recorded in Other charges and   $26 million   in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $74 million   were charges of: (i)   $54 million   for employee separation costs, (ii)   $20 million   for impairments, including   $17 million   for a building impairment and   $3 million   for the impairment of the corporate aircraft, and (iii)   $5 million   for exit costs, partially offset by   $5 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed. 
  During the   third   quarter of   2015  , we recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $41 million   including charges of   $40 million   recorded in Other charges and   $1 million   in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $41 million   were charges of: (i)   $26 million   for the impairment of corporate aircraft, (ii)   $11 million   of charges related to employee separation costs, and (iii) a   $6 million   building impairment charge, partially offset by   $2 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed. 
  During the   first nine months   of   2015  , we recorded net reorganization of business charges of   $70 million   including charges of   $65 million   recorded in Other charges and   $5 million   in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the   $70 million   were charges of: (i)   $36 million   related to employee separation costs, (ii)   $26 million   for the impairment of the corporate aircraft, (iii) a   $6 million   building impairment charge, and (iv)   $4 million   for exit costs, partially offset by   $2 million   of reversals for accruals no longer needed. 
  The following table displays the net charges incurred by business segment: 

Cash payments for employee severance and exit costs in connection with the reorganization of business plans were   $59 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   and   $53 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The reorganization of business accruals at   October 1, 2016   were   $55 million  , of which   $46 million   relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year and   $9 million   of accruals related primarily to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We   decreased   the aggregate of our cash and cash equivalent balances by   $293 million   from   $2.0 billion   as of   December 31, 2015   to   $1.7 billion   as of   October 1, 2016  . The decrease is primarily due to: (i)   $1.0 billion   paid in the acquisition of GDCL and (ii)   $941 million   of capital returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid, offset by (i)   $673 million   of net proceeds raised by the issuance of the Term Loan (net of   $2 million   of issuance costs paid), (ii)   $382 million   of proceeds received from the sale of United Kingdom treasury securities used to partially fund the acquisition of GDCL, and (iii)   $652 million   of cash generated by operating activities. 
  As highlighted in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components: (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) operating activities, (iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing activities. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  At   October 1, 2016  ,   $1.0 billion   of the   $1.7 billion   cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and approximately   $680 million   was held by the Company or its subsidiaries in other countries, with approximately   $354 million   held in the United Kingdom. Restricted cash was   $63 million   at both   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the   first nine months   of   2016   was   $652 million  , as compared to   $607 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . Operating cash flows in the   first nine months   of   2016  , as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , were positively impacted by higher earnings from continuing operations (adjusted for net non-cash charges), offset by higher employee incentive payments. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used by investing activities was   $721 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $129 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   $721 million   cash used in the   first nine months   of   2016   included: (i)   $1.2 billion   cash used for acquisitions and investments, including   $1.0 billion   paid for the acquisition of GDCL, and (ii)   $211 million   in capital expenditures, partially offset by: (i)   $637 million   of proceeds from sales of investments and businesses and (ii)   $68 million   of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The cash usage of   $129 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015   consisted primarily of: (i)   $150 million   cash used for acquisitions and investments and (ii)   $131 million   in capital expenditures, partially offset by: (i)   $150 million   of proceeds from the sale of investments and businesses and (ii)   $2 million   of proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment.  
  Acquisition and Investments:    We used net cash for acquisitions and investments of   $1.2 billion   during the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to   $150 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . We paid cash of   $1.0 billion   during the   first nine months   of   2016   related to the acquisition of GDCL. The remainder of the cash was used for several debt and equity investments. The cash used during the   first nine months   of   2015   consisted of   $49 million   related to the acquisition of two public safety software solution providers and several debt and equity investments.

  Capital Expenditures:      Capital expenditures increased in the   first nine months   of   2016   to   $211 million  , compared to   $131 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to revenue-generating network expenditures, information technology spend, and facility expenditures.  
     Sales of Property, Plant, and Equipment:      We had   $68 million   of proceeds related to the sale of property, plant, and equipment in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to   $2 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .

   34 

Financing Activities 
  Net cash used for financing activities was   $191 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $2.2 billion   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . Cash used for financing activities in the   first nine months   of   2016   was primarily comprised of: (i)   $728 million   used for purchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program and (ii)   $213 million   of cash used for the payment of dividends, partially offset by: (i)   $673 million   of net proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan and (ii)   $80 million   of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan.

  Long-Term Debt:      We had outstanding long-term debt of   $5.0 billion   and   $4.3 billion  , including the current portions of   $5 million   and   $4 million   at   October 1, 2016   at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  In connection with the completion of the acquisition of GDCL, we entered into a new term loan credit agreement (the  Term Loan Agreement ), under which we borrowed a Term Loan with an initial principal amount of   $675 million  . We received net proceeds of   $673 million  , net of   $2 million   of issuance costs. Interest on the Term Loan is variable and indexed to LIBOR. No additional borrowings are permitted under the Term Loan Agreement and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 
  We have investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt from the three largest U.S. national rating agencies. We continue to believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets. Any future disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets or deterioration in our credit ratings may result in higher funding costs for us and adversely affect our ability to access funds. 
  Share Repurchase Program:   During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company paid an aggregate of   $728 million  , including transaction costs, to repurchase approximately   10.5 million   shares at an average price of   $69.31   per share. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had used approximately   $11.7 billion   of the share repurchase authority, including transaction costs, to repurchase shares, leaving   $2.3 billion   of authority available for future repurchases. 
  Payment of Dividends:   During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we paid   $70 million   in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. During the   first nine months   of   2016  , we paid   $213 million   in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid an additional   $68 million   in cash dividends to holders of our common stock.  
  Credit Facilities 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had a   $2.1 billion   unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility, which includes a   $450 million   letter of credit sub-limit, (the  2014 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement ) scheduled to mature on May 29, 2019. We must comply with certain customary covenants, including maximum leverage ratio as defined in the 2014 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of   October 1, 2016  . We did not borrow or issue any letters of credit under the 2014 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement during the   first nine months   of   2016  . 
  Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments 
  Outstanding Commitments:        We had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling   $214 million   at   October 1, 2016  , compared to   $112 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Outstanding Long-Term Receivables:      We had net non-current long-term receivables of   $43 million   at   October 1, 2016  , compared to   $47 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Sales of Receivables

Other Contingencies 
  Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying Contract Value:      In certain circumstances, we may enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the damages that could be claimed by the other party for failed performance might exceed the revenue we receive from the contract. Contracts with these types of uncapped damage provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still represent meaningful risk. There is a possibility that a damage claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result in expenses to us that are far in excess of the revenue received from the counterparty in connection with the contract. 
  Indemnification Provisions:      We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we are obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. In indemnification cases, payment by us is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow us to challenge the other party's claims. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. 
  Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of our assets or businesses and require us to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. Our obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, and for amounts for breaches of such representations and warranties in connection with prior divestitures not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. We had   no   accruals for any such obligations at   October 1, 2016  . 
  Legal Matters:      We are a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount it expects to receive for those goods and services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and estimates and changes in those estimates. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date" that delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to January 1, 2018, as the our annual reporting period begins after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. In April of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP. In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria. The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption we will elect and are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for us January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period.  The ASU requires a modified retrospective method upon adoption. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so for which it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. Upon adoption, we do not anticipate significant changes to our existing accounting policies or presentation of the Statement of Cash Flows. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory,  as part of the Board s simplification initiative aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. This  
  
   36 

ASU eliminates the current application of deferring the income tax effect of intra-entity asset transfers, other than inventory, until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use and will require entities to recognize tax expense when the transfer occurs. The guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period; early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a modified retrospective application with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling   $744 million  , compared to   $494 million   outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions. 
  The following table shows the five largest net notional amounts of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of   October 1, 2016  , and the corresponding positions as of   December 31, 2015  :

Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements included in: (1)  Management's Discussion and Analysis,  about: (a) the impact of the GDCL acquisition on our business, (b) trends affecting our business, including: (i) the impact of macroeconomic conditions, (ii) the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, (iii) the impact of cost savings initiatives on operating expenses, (iv) the growth of our Services segment and the resulting impact on consolidated gross margin, and (v) the decline of iDEN product and services sales and the related impact on revenue and gross margins within the Services segment, (c) our business strategies and expected results, (d) future payments, charges, use of accruals and expected cost-saving benefits associated with our productivity improvement plans, reorganization of business programs, and employee separation costs, (e) our ability and cost to repatriate funds, (f) our ability to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash, (g) our ability and cost to access the capital markets at our current ratings, (h) our ability to borrow and the amount available under our credit facilities, (i) our plans with respect to the level of outstanding debt, (j) the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and/or repurchasing shares, (k) the adequacy of our cash balances to meet current operating requirements, (l) potential contractual damages claims, and (m) the outcome and effect of ongoing and future legal proceedings, (2)  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,  about the impact of foreign currency exchange risks, (3)  Legal Proceedings,  about the ultimate disposition of pending legal matters, and (4) "Controls and Procedures," about the implementation of our enterprise resource planning systems.

  Some of the risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed within this document and in Part I,  Item 1A: Risk Factors  on pages 9 through 22 of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings available for free on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on Motorola Solutions' website at www.motorolasolutions.com. We wish to caution the reader that the risk factors discussed in each of these documents and those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. 
  
   38 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to Motorola Solutions, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Motorola Solutions  management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016  , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
  We previously were in the process of a multi-year phased upgrade and consolidation of our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) systems into a single global platform across our businesses. With the sale of the Enterprise business which included the transfer of our existing ERP system to Zebra, we have entered into transition service agreements which require us to operate in a shared information technology environment with Zebra until 2017. We are completing the design phase for the initial release of our future ERP system and have begun system integration testing. Phase one will allow us to cease using the Zebra transition services agreement and includes the replacement of regional systems supporting our product based business and the current indirect procurement system. Phase one is scheduled to go-live in 2017.

Part II Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  The reader should carefully consider, in connection with the other information in this report, the factors discussed below and in Part I,  Item 1A: Risk Factors  on pages 9 through 22 of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
