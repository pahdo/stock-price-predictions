NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Coeur Mining, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Coeur  or the   Company ) are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for the fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results reported in these interim statements may not be indicative of the results which will be reported for the year ending December 31, 2016. The condensed consolidated December 31, 2015 balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Recent Accounting Standards  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),    which provides guidance on presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing these changes on the Company's consolidated cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,    which  amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing these changes on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases,    which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on the balance sheet. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. Modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, is required with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing these changes on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,    Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,    which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current.  The updated guidance became effective upon early adoption for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2015, and resulted in a reclassification of amounts from   Current deferred tax assets   to   Non-current deferred tax assets   and   Current deferred tax liabilities   to   Non-current deferred tax liabilities   in the current and prior periods. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,    Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,    which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated.  These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016.  The Company's adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,    Deferral of the Effective Date  ,  which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers        to January 1, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting the prescribed changes on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,    Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,        which provides a revised, simpler measurement for inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing these changes on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,        which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of that debt liability, not as an asset.  The updated guidance became effective under early adoption for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2015, and resulted in a reclassification of amounts from   Other Non-current Assets   to   Debt   in the current and prior periods. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,        which amends the consolidation requirements in ASC 810.  These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016.  The Company's adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

    Coeur Mining, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Company s effective tax rate is impacted by recurring items, such as foreign exchange rates on deferred tax balances, uncertain tax position and mining tax expense accruals, and the full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to losses in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. During the third quarter, the Company completed a legal entity reorganization to integrate recent acquisitions resulting in a valuation allowance release of   $40.8 million   and recorded a   $15.0 million   deferred tax benefit related to unremitted earnings. In addition, the Company's consolidated effective income and mining tax rate is a function of the combined effective tax rates and foreign exchange rates in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Variations in the jurisdictional mix of income and loss and foreign exchange rates result in significant fluctuations in our consolidated effective tax rate. 
  A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. Each quarter, the Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined that the Company will ultimately be more likely than not able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of risk factors that could impact the Company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. For additional information, please see the sections titled   Risk Factors  set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
  The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The statute of limitations remains open from 2012 forward for the U.S. federal jurisdiction and from 2008 forward for certain other foreign jurisdictions. As a result of statutes of limitation that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions and possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to which none of the issues are individually significant, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease between   $3.5 million   and   $4.5 million   in the next 12 months. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $22.6 million   and   $17.9 million   of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. If recognized, these unrecognized tax benefits would positively impact the Company s effective income tax rate. The Company s continuing practice is to recognize potential interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax expense. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties was   $9.0 million   and   $9.2 million  , respectively.

NOTE 9   NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE 
  Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   215,298   and   3,302,701   shares and   404,543   and   3,251,347   shares, respectively, of common stock equivalents related to equity-based awards were not included in the diluted per share calculation as the shares would be antidilutive.  
  The   3.25%   Convertible Senior Notes ( Convertible Notes ) were not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   because there is no excess value upon conversion over the principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The outstanding Convertible Notes were redeemed in the third quarter of 2016. 

During the second quarter 2016, the Company completed a   $75.0 million    at the market  stock offering (   $75.0 million   offering ). In connection with the   $75.0 million   offering, the Company sold   9,253,016   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $8.11   per share.  
  Pursuant to an equity distribution agreement dated September 9, 2016, the Company may issue and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through ordinary broker transactions having an aggregate offering price of up to   $200.0 million  , with the net proceeds available for repayment of indebtedness and other general corporate purposes. The terms of sales transactions under the agreement, including trading day(s), number of shares sold in the aggregate, number of shares sold per trading day, and the floor selling price per share, are proposed by the Company to the sales agents. Whether or not the Company engages in sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including share price, our cash resources, customary black-out restrictions, and whether we have any material nonpublic information. The agreement can be terminated by the Company at any time, and the Company has initially authorized sales under the agreement through no later than June 30, 2017. The shares issued under the equity distribution agreement are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had sold   4,293,785   shares under the agreement for net proceeds of approximately   $53.4 million  , net of commissions and fees of approximately   $1.2 million  . 

NOTE 10   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), secondary priority to quoted prices in inactive markets or observable inputs (Level 2), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
  
   13 

    Coeur Mining, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The following table presents the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement: 

The Company s investments in equity securities are recorded at fair market value in the financial statements based primarily on quoted market prices.  Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  Quoted market prices are not available for certain equity securities; these securities are valued using pricing models, which require the use of observable and unobservable inputs, and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The Company s silver and gold options and other derivative instruments, net, which relate to concentrate and certain dor  sales contracts and foreign exchange contracts, are valued using pricing models, which require inputs that are derived from observable market data, including contractual terms, forward market prices, yield curves, credit spreads, and other unobservable inputs. The model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The fair values of the Palmarejo royalty obligation embedded derivative and Rochester NSR royalty obligation were estimated based on observable market data including contractual terms, forward silver and gold prices, yield curves, and credit spreads, as well as the Company s current mine plan which is considered a significant unobservable input.  Therefore, the Company has classified these obligations as Level 3 financial liabilities. Based on current mine plans,   1.9   years was used to estimate the fair value of the Rochester NSR royalty obligation at   September 30, 2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , there was no balance outstanding related to the Palmarejo royalty obligation embedded derivative as a result of the satisfaction of the minimum ounce obligation under the Palmarejo gold production royalty obligation in the third quarter of 2016. 
  No assets or liabilities were transferred between fair value levels in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The following tables present the changes in the fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial assets and liabilities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  :

    Coeur Mining, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities carried at book value in the financial statements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is presented in the following table: 

(1) 
    Net of unamortized debt issuance costs and premium received of   $4.4 million  . 

(1) 
    Net of unamortized debt issuance costs and premium received of   $5.3 million  . 
              (2)  
    Net of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $5.0 million  . 
     The fair values of the Convertible Notes and   7.875%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the  Senior Notes ) outstanding were estimated using quoted market prices.  The fair value of the Term Loan due 2020 (the  Term Loan ) approximates book value (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs) as the liability is secured, has a variable interest rate, and lacks significant credit concerns.  The fair value of the San Bartolom  line of credit approximates book value due to the short-term nature of the liability and absence of significant interest rate or credit concerns.  The fair value of the Palmarejo gold production royalty obligation is estimated based on observable market data including contractual terms, forward silver and gold prices, yield curves, and credit spreads, as well as the Company s current mine plan which is considered a significant unobservable input. 

NOTE 11   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Palmarejo Gold Production Royalty 
  On January 21, 2009, the Company's subsidiary, Coeur Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. ( Coeur Mexicana ), entered into a gold production royalty agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation. The royalty covered   50%   of the life of mine production from the Palmarejo mine and legacy adjacent properties, excluding production from the properties acquired in the 2015 Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. ( Paramount ) acquisition.  The royalty transaction included a minimum obligation of   4,167   gold ounces per month and terminated effective as of the date payments on   400,000   gold ounces were made, which occurred in July 2016.  
  
   15 

    Coeur Mining, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The price volatility associated with the minimum royalty obligation was considered an embedded derivative. The Company was required to recognize the change in fair value of the remaining minimum obligation due to changing gold prices.  Unrealized gains were recognized in periods when the gold price decreased from the previous period and unrealized losses were recognized in periods when the gold price increases.  The fair value of the embedded derivative was reflected net of the Company's current credit adjusted risk free rate, which was   19.9%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The fair value of the embedded derivative at   December 31, 2015   was a liability of   $5.0 million  .  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the mark-to-market adjustments were losses of   $0.1 million   and gains of   $3.0 million   and losses of   $5.9 million   and gains   $1.8 million  , respectively.   
  Payments on the royalty obligation decreased the carrying amount of the minimum obligation and the derivative liability. Each monthly payment was an amount equal to the greater of the minimum of   4,167   ounces of gold or   50%   of actual gold production multiplied by the excess of the monthly average market price of gold above   $416   per ounce, subject to a   1%   annual inflation adjustment. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , realized losses on settlement of the liabilities were   $0.1 million   and   $3.3 million   and   $5.9 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively.  The mark-to-market adjustments and realized losses are included in   Fair value adjustments, net  . 
  Provisional Silver and Gold Sales 
    The Company enters into sales contracts with third-party smelters and refiners which, in some cases, provide for a provisional payment based upon preliminary assays and quoted metal prices. The provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes.  The host contract is the receivable recorded at the forward price at the time of sale.  The embedded derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings each period until final settlement.  Changes in silver and gold prices resulted in provisional pricing mark-to-market losses of   $0.8 million   and gains of   $0.1 million  ,   $0.4 million   and   $0.4 million   in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of   0.3 million   ounces of silver and   24,449   ounces of gold at prices of   $19.35   and   $1,315  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following derivative instruments that settle as follows: 

Silver and Gold Options 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had realized losses of    $1.6 million   from settled contracts. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had realized gains of   $1.1 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company had   no   unrealized gains or losses  related to outstanding options which were included in   Fair value adjustments, net.   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no outstanding gold and silver options contracts. 
  The following summarizes the classification of the fair value of the derivative instruments:

Capital Lease Obligations 
    From time to time, the Company acquires mining equipment under capital lease agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into new lease financing arrangements primarily for a larger haul truck fleet at its Rochester mine and mining equipment to support the continued underground mine expansion at the Palmarejo complex. All capital lease obligations are recorded, upon lease inception, at the present value of future minimum lease payments.   
  Palmarejo Gold Production Royalty Obligation 
  On January 21, 2009, Coeur Mexicana entered into a gold production royalty transaction with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation under which the subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation purchased a royalty covering   50%   of the life of mine gold to be produced from the Palmarejo silver and gold mine in Mexico. On October 2, 2014, Coeur Mexicana terminated the Palmarejo gold production royalty in exchange for a termination payment of   $2.0 million  , effective upon completion of the minimum ounce delivery requirement. Subsequently, Coeur Mexicana entered into a gold stream agreement (the  Gold Stream Agreement ) with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation whereby Coeur Mexicana will sell 50% of Palmarejo gold production (excluding production from the recently acquired Paramount properties) effective upon completion of the gold production royalty minimum ounce delivery requirement.  
  In July 2016, the remaining minimum obligation under the Palmarejo royalty agreement was satisfied and the termination of the Palmarejo royalty agreement became effective. The royalty agreement provided for a minimum obligation to be paid monthly on a total of   400,000   ounces of gold, or   4,167   ounces per month over an initial   eight   year period. Each monthly payment was an amount equal to the greater of   4,167   ounces of gold or   50%   of actual gold production multiplied by the excess of the monthly average market price of gold above   $416   per ounce, subject to a   1%   annual inflation compounding adjustment. Payments under the royalty agreement were made in cash or gold bullion. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company paid   $7.6 million   and   $10.2 million  , respectively and the Company paid   $27.2 million   and   $30.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recognized accretion expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $0.0 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, and   $1.2 million   and   $5.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Following the completion of the minimum ounce obligation and the effective termination of the Palmarejo royalty agreement in July 2016, Coeur Mexicana began selling 50% of the Palmarejo gold production (excluding production from the recently acquired Paramount properties) for the lesser of   $800   or spot price per ounce under the Gold Stream Agreement.

NOTE 20   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Labor Union Contract 
  The Company maintains a labor agreement with Sindicato de Trabajadores Mineros de la Empresa Manquiri S.A. at the San Bartolom  mine in Bolivia.  The San Bartolom  mine labor agreement, which became effective January 28, 2010, is currently active and does not have a fixed term. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   11%   of the Company s global labor force was covered by this collective bargaining agreement. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed on similar terms or at all, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last. 
  Rochester Production Royalty 
  Commencing January 1, 2014, Coeur Rochester is obligated to pay a   3.4%   net smelter returns royalty on up to   39.4 million   silver equivalent ounces produced and sold from a portion of the Rochester mine, payable on a quarterly basis. For each calendar quarter, the royalty is payable on the actual sales prices received (exclusive of gains or losses associated with trading activities), less refining and related costs, of gold and silver produced and sold from the applicable portions of the Rochester mine. Changes in the Company's mine plan and silver and gold prices result in the recognition of mark-to-market gains or losses in   Fair value adjustments, net  .  At   September 30, 2016  , a total of   20.1 million   silver equivalent ounces remain outstanding under the obligation. 
  Palmarejo Gold Production Royalty and Gold Stream 
  On January 21, 2009, Coeur Mexicana entered into a gold production royalty agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation under which the subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation purchased a royalty covering   50%   of the life of mine gold to be produced from its Palmarejo silver and gold mine in Mexico (excluding production from the recently acquired Paramount properties).  The royalty agreement provided for a minimum obligation of   4,167   ounces per month over an initial eight-year period for a total of   400,000   ounces of gold. On October 2, 2014, Coeur Mexicana terminated the Palmarejo gold production royalty in exchange for a termination payment of   $2.0 million  . In July 2016, the remaining minimum obligation under the Palmarejo royalty agreement was satisfied and the termination of the Palmarejo royalty agreement became effective. 
  Subsequently, Coeur Mexicana entered into the Gold Stream Agreement, whereby Coeur Mexicana will sell   50%   of Palmarejo gold production (excluding production from the recently acquired Paramount properties) to a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation upon completion of the gold production royalty minimum ounce delivery requirement, for the lesser of   $800   or spot price per ounce. Under the Gold Stream Agreement, Coeur Mexicana received a   $22.0 million   deposit toward future deliveries under the Gold Stream Agreement.  
  Sites Related to Callahan Mining Corporation 
  In 1991, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation. The Company has received requests for information or notices of potential liability from state or federal agencies with regard to Callahan's operations at sites in Maine, Colorado and Washington. The Company did not make any decisions with respect to generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at these sites. Therefore, the Company believes that it is not liable for any potential cleanup costs either directly as an operator or indirectly as a parent. The Company anticipates that further agency interaction may occur with respect to these sites. 
    
  Callahan operated a mine and mill in Brooksville, Maine from 1968 until 1972 and subsequently disposed of the property. In 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, made a formal request to the Company for information regarding the site. The site was placed on the National Priorities List on September 5, 2002, and the Maine Department of Transportation, a partial owner of the property, signed a consent order in 2005. In January 2009, the EPA and the State of Maine made additional formal requests to the Company for information relating to the site, to which the Company responded. The first phase of cleanup at the site began in April 2011. 
       
  The Van Stone Mine in Stevens County, Washington consists of several parcels of land and was mined from 1926 until 1993 by multiple owners. Callahan sold its parcel in 1990. In February 2010, the State of Washington Department of Ecology notified Callahan that it, among others, is a potentially liable person (PLP) under Washington law. 
    
  Under lease and option agreements with several owners, Callahan was involved with the Akron Mine located in Gunnison County, Colorado from 1937-1960.  The United States Forest Service ( USFS ) made formal requests for information to Callahan regarding the site in December 2003, February 2007, March 2013, and November 2013.  Callahan timely responded to each request.  In August 2014, Callahan received a notice of potential CERCLA liability from the USFS regarding environmental contamination at the Akron Mine.

Bolivian Temporary Restriction on Mining above   4,400   Meters 
  On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of   4,400   meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken.  The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL.  The stability studies have been completed and officially submitted to the Bolivian mining technical authorities.  Accordingly, the COMIBOL suspension has expired in accordance with the terms of the resolution.  As a result of the resolution, the Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below   4,400   meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with whom the Company has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high grade material above the   4,400   meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the   4,400   meter level known as Huacajchi Sur.  Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, the Company resumed limited mining operations at the San Bartolom  mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur.  Despite the fact that the COMIBOL suspension has expired, the Company has not resumed mining in other areas above the   4,400   meter level due to community relations concerns and the current political climate in Bolivia. 
    
  While the COMIBOL suspension has expired, it is uncertain at this time how long the Company will continue to suspend its mining operations in areas above the   4,400   meter level other than at Huacajchi and Huacajchi Sur.  If COMIBOL decides to affirmatively adopt a new resolution to restrict access above the   4,400   meter level on a permanent basis, the Company may need to further write down the carrying value of the asset.  While a portion of the Company's proven and probable reserves relate to material above the   4,400   meter level at San Bartolom , so long as operations remain suspended, there is a risk that silver may not be produced from this material at expected levels or at all, particularly given the remaining anticipated mine life of this asset.  It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.

We believe it is important to read this discussion in conjunction with our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this quarterly report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 10-K ), as well as other information we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  We provide certain operational and financial data on a silver equivalent basis, converting gold to silver at a 60:1 ratio of silver ounces to gold ounces.  We also provide realized silver equivalent data using a ratio determined by average realized silver and gold prices during the relevant period. Silver and gold equivalence are stated at a 60:1 ratio unless otherwise noted. 
  Overview 
    We are a gold and silver producer with mines located in the United States, Mexico, and Bolivia and exploration projects in the United States, Mexico and Argentina. The Palmarejo complex, Rochester, Kensington, Wharf, and San Bartolom  mines constitute our principal sources of revenue. The Company also owns Coeur Capital, which is primarily comprised of the Endeavor silver stream. 
  The Company's strategy is to discover, acquire, develop and operate low-cost silver and gold mines that produce long-term cash flow, provide opportunities for growth through continued exploration, and generate superior and sustainable returns for stockholders. Management focuses on maximizing net cash flow through identifying and implementing revenue enhancement opportunities, reducing operating and non-operating costs, exercising consistent capital discipline, and efficient working capital management.  
  Third Quarter Highlights

Consolidated Financial Results 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Net   income   was   $69.6 million   (  $0.42   per share) compared to   Net   loss   of   $14.2 million   (  $(0.11)   per share).  The increase in   Net income   is primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax valuation allowances and other deferred tax benefits, higher average realized silver and gold prices, lower gold costs applicable to sales per ounce, and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower silver and gold production, and unfavorable fair value adjustments. 
  Revenue 
    Metal sales   increased     10%   due to an   increase   of   34%   and   18%   in average realized silver and gold prices, respectively, partially offset by lower ounces sold. The Company sold   3.4 million   silver ounces and   83,389   gold ounces, compared to sales of   4.0 million   silver ounces and   91,118   gold ounces. Gold contributed   62%   of sales and silver contributed   38%  , compared to   63%   of sales from gold and   37%   from silver. Royalty revenue was lower due to the Company's divestiture of several non-core royalty assets in 2016.  
  Costs Applicable to Sales 
  Costs applicable to sales were lower due to lower silver and gold ounces sold, partially offset by lower gold unit costs.  For a complete discussion of costs applicable to sales, see   Results of Operations   below. 
  
   33 

Amortization 
  Amortization   decreased   by   $7.7 million  , or   22%  , primarily due to lower amortizable mineral interests and mining equipment, and lower silver and gold production. 
  Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses   increased     6%   due to higher forfeited stock awards in 2015, partially offset by lower professional services costs. 
  Exploration expense   increased     $1.6 million  , due to the Company's expansion of exploration activities at Palmarejo, Kensington and Rochester. 
  Pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses   decreased     9%   to   $4.5 million  , primarily as of result of lower transaction related costs. 
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Non-cash fair value adjustments, net, were a   loss   of   $1.0 million   compared to a   gain   of   $5.8 million  , primarily due to the impact of changes in future metal prices on the Rochester 3.4% NSR royalty obligation. 
  Interest expense (net of capitalized interest of   $0.5 million  )   decreased   to   $8.1 million   from   $12.4 million  , primarily due to lower outstanding Senior Notes due 2021, repayment of the Term Loan and lower accretion of terminated Palmarejo gold production royalty obligation. 
  Other, net   increased   by   $5.3 million  , primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses, a   $4.7 million   pre-tax gain the on sale of a non-core royalty asset and gains from the sale of investments, partially offset by $10.0 million of losses on extinguishments of debt. 
  Income and Mining Taxes  
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company reported estimated income and mining tax   benefit   of approximately   $54.5 million  , for an effective tax rate of   360.6%  . Estimated income and mining tax   benefit   during the third quarter of 2015 was   $8.3 million  , for an effective tax rate of   36.7%  . The following table summarizes the components of the Company s income (loss) before tax and income and mining tax (expense) benefit: 

The Company s effective tax rate is impacted by recurring items, such as foreign exchange rates on deferred tax balances, uncertain tax position and mining tax expense accruals, and the full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to losses in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company completed a legal entity reorganization to integrate recent acquisitions, resulting in a valuation allowance release of $40.8 million and recorded a   $15.0 million   deferred tax benefit related to unremitted earnings. Exclusive of the reorganization, income and mining tax benefit would be $13.7 million, for an effective tax rate of 91%. In addition, the Company's consolidated effective income tax rate is a function of the combined effective tax rates and foreign exchange rates in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Variations in the jurisdictional mix of income and loss and foreign exchange rates result in significant fluctuations in its consolidated effective tax rate. 
  A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. Each quarter, the Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined that the Company will ultimately be more likely than not able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of risk factors that could impact the Company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. 

34 

Likewise, there are a number of factors that can potentially impact the Company s effective tax, including the geographic distribution of income, the non-recognition of tax assets, changes in tax laws, and the impact of specific transactions. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Net   income   was   $63.7 million   (  $0.40   per share) compared to   Net   loss     $64.2 million   (  $(0.52)   per share). The increase  in   Net income   is primarily due to reduction in deferred tax valuation allowances  and other deferred tax benefits, higher gold production, higher average realized silver and gold prices, lower gold and silver costs applicable to sales per ounce, lower exploration costs, and lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower silver production, and unfavorable fair value adjustments. 
  Revenue 
    Metal sales   increased     6%   due to higher average realized gold and silver prices and higher gold ounces sold as a result of a full nine months of Wharf production, partially offset by lower silver ounces sold. The Company's average realized silver and gold prices   increased   by   9%   and   8%  , respectively. The Company sold   10.9 million   silver ounces and   251,023   gold ounces, compared to sales of   12.1 million   silver ounces and   243,851   gold ounces.  Gold contributed   62%   of sales and silver contributed   38%  , compared to   60%   of sales from gold and   40%   from silver.  Royalty revenue was lower due to the Company's divestiture of several non-core royalty assets in 2016.  
  Costs Applicable to Sales 
  Costs applicable to sales were lower due to lower unit costs at all mine sites and lower silver ounces sold, partially offset by higher gold ounces sold.  For a complete discussion of costs applicable to sales, see   Results of Operations   below. 
  Amortization 
  Amortization   decreased   by   $14.3 million  , or   13%  , due to lower amortizable mineral interests and mining equipment, and lower silver production. 
  Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses   decreased     $1.2 million  , or   5%  , due to lower professional services costs. 
  Exploration expense   decreased     $2.3 million  , or   23%  , due to less drilling activity at Palmarejo, and Rochester. 
  Pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses   decreased     7%   to   $13.1 million  , primarily due to prior year Wharf acquisition costs. 
  Write-downs of   $4.4 million   ($3.9 million net of tax) were primarily related to the Company's silver stream on the Endeavor mine in Australia as a result of the decision by the mine operator to significantly curtail production due to low lead and zinc prices.  
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Non-cash fair value adjustments, net, were a   loss   of   $13.2 million   compared to a   gain   of   $3.7 million  , primarily due to the impact of changes in future metal prices on the Palmarejo gold production royalty (terminated in the third quarter of 2016)  and the Rochester 3.4% NSR royalty obligation. 
  Interest expense (net of capitalized interest of   $0.9 million  )   decreased   to   $30.1 million   from   $33.9 million   primarily due to lower outstanding Senior Notes due 2021, repayment of the Term Loan and lower accretion of the terminated Palmarejo gold production royalty obligation. 
  Other, net   increased   by   $10.1 million  , primarily due to the   $5.3 million   pre-tax gain on the sale of the Martha assets in Argentina, the   $7.8 million   pre-tax gain on the sale of non-core royalty assets, lower foreign exchange losses, and gains from the sale of investments, partially offset by $10.0 million of losses on extinguishments of debt. 
  Income and Mining Taxes  
  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company reported estimated income and mining tax   benefit   of approximately   $53.1 million  , for an effective tax rate of   503.9%  . Estimated income and mining tax   benefit   during the first nine months of 2015 was   $8.5 million  , for an effective tax rate of   11.6%  .  
  The following table summarizes the components of the Company s income (loss) before tax and income and mining tax (expense) benefit:

The Company completed a legal entity reorganization to integrate recent acquisitions, resulting in a valuation allowance release of $40.8 million and recorded a   $15.0 million   deferred tax benefit related to unremitted earnings.  Exclusive of the reorganization the income and mining tax benefit would be $12.3 million, for an effective tax rate of 117%. In addition, the Company's consolidated effective income tax rate is a function of the combined effective tax rates and foreign exchange rates in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Variations in the jurisdictional mix of income and loss and foreign exchange rates result in significant fluctuations in its consolidated effective tax rate.

     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016     compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Silver production at Endeavor   decreased   as a result of the mine operator's decision to significantly curtail production due to low lead and zinc prices. Costs applicable to sales per ounce   increased   due to the impact of higher silver prices on the Company's silver price sharing agreement with the Endeavor mine operator.  Amortization was   $0.1 million   compared to   $2.0 million   due to lower amortizable mineral interest.  In the third quarter of 2016, Coeur completed the sale of the non-core Correnso royalty asset for total consideration of   $5.4 million   including $0.7 million of contingent consideration. The Company realized a gain of   $4.7 million   on the sale, which is recorded in   Other, net.  
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016     compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Silver production at Endeavor   decreased   as a result of the mine operator's decision to significantly curtail production due to low lead and zinc prices. Costs applicable to sales per ounce was mostly consistent. Royalty revenue was   $3.4 million   compared to   $5.4 million   as the Company continued to sell non-core royalty assets. Amortization was   $1.0 million   compared to   $6.8 million   due to lower amortizable mineral interest. In  2016, Coeur completed the sale of non-core royalty assets for total consideration of   $21.0 million  . The Company recognized a net gain of   $7.8 million  , which is recorded in   Other, net,   related to the sale of these non-core assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $47.8 million   and   $100.4 million  , respectively, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $36.8 million   and   $70.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, and was impacted by the following key factors:

     See Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures. 

Cash provided by operating activities   increased     $11.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   due to higher average realized prices and lower costs applicable to sales per company-wide silver equivalent ounce, partially offset by lower ounces sold and unfavorable working capital adjustments. Metal sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $15.5 million  ,   $38.4 million   was due to higher average realized prices, offset by   $22.9 million   from lower silver equivalent ounces sold.  The   $10.3 million   working capital   increase   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase on ore on leach pads and a reduction in accounts payable, partially offset by lower trade receivables, compared to the   $8.2 million   working capital   decrease   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower trade receivables and precious metal inventory, partially offset by a reduction in accrued interest, payroll, and other benefits. 
  Cash provided by operating activities   increased     $30.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to higher average realized prices and lower costs applicable to sales per company-wide silver equivalent ounce, partially offset by unfavorable working capital adjustments.  Metal sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $26.8 million   of which   $39.5 million   was due to higher average realized prices offset by   $12.7 million   due to lower silver equivalent ounces sold.  The   $28.5 million   working capital   increase   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in ore on leach pads, precious metal inventory, and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by lower trade receivables, compared to the   $6.5 million   working capital   decrease   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower trade receivables and a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable. 
  Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash   used in   investing activities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $18.1 million   compared to   $23.6 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to proceeds from the sales of non-core assets in 2016. The Company had capital expenditures of   $25.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   $23.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily related to underground development at Palmarejo and Kensington. 
  
   42 

Net cash   used in   investing activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $53.7 million   compared to   $179.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to proceeds from the sales of non-core assets in 2016 and the acquisitions of Paramount and the Wharf gold mine in 2015. The Company had capital expenditures of   $71.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $65.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily related to underground development at Palmarejo and Kensington. 
  Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $64.9 million   compared to   $12.8 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company voluntarily terminated  and repaid the Term Loan for   $103.4 million   including the   $99.0 million   remaining principal balance and a   $4.4 million   prepayment premium, partially offset by net proceeds of approximately   $49.5 million   received from the settlement of   4.0 million   shares of its common stock in connection with the   $200.0 million    at the market  stock offering.  
  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $24.8 million   compared to a source of    $44.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company received net proceeds of approximately $73.1 million from the sale of   9.3 million   shares of its common stock in connection with the   $75.0 million    at the market  stock offering and net proceeds of approximately   $49.5 million   received from the sale of   4.0 million   shares of its common stock in connection with   $200.0 million    at the market  stock offering. The Company voluntarily terminated  and repaid the Term Loan for   $103.4 million  , including the   $99.0 million   remaining principal balance and a   $4.4 million   prepayment premium. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company entered into a $50.0 million Short-term Loan which was subsequently repaid upon entering into the $100.0 million Term Loan and repaid $9.4 million of debt at San Bartolome. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a privately-negotiated agreement to exchange $10.8 million in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes for 0.7 million shares of common stock. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the exchange, the exchange resulted in a loss of $1.2 million which is recognized in Other, net in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
  Pursuant to an equity distribution agreement dated September 9, 2016, the Company may issue and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through ordinary broker transactions having an aggregate offering price of up to   $200.0 million  , with the net proceeds available for repayment of indebtedness and other general corporate purposes. The terms of sales transactions under the agreement, including trading day(s), number of shares sold in the aggregate, number of shares sold per trading day, and the floor selling price per share, are proposed by the Company to the sales agents. Whether or not the Company engages in sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including share price, our cash resources, customary black-out restrictions, and whether we have any material nonpublic information. The agreement can be terminated by the Company at any time, and the Company has initially authorized sales under the agreement through no later than June 30, 2017. The shares issued under the equity distribution agreement are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had sold   4,293,785   shares under the agreement for net proceeds of approximately   $53.4 million  , net of commissions and fees of approximately   $1.2 million  . 

Other Liquidity Matters 
  The Company reduced debt by   $109.3 million  , or 21% during the third quarter of 2016. Together with higher adjusted EBITDA, the Company continues to significantly reduce its financial leverage. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities. 
  The Company has asserted indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign subsidiary earnings as determined by management s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. The Company does not believe that the amounts reinvested will have a material impact on liquidity. 
  In order to reduce future cash interest payments, and/or amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, from time to time we may repurchase certain of our debt securities for cash or in exchange for other securities, which may include secured or unsecured notes or equity, in each case in open market or privately negotiated transactions.  We regularly engage in conversations with our bondholders and evaluate any such transactions in light of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.  The amounts involved may be significant and any such transactions may occur at a substantial discount to the debt securities' face amount.

Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Developments 
  Please see Note 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures 
  Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 
  Management uses   Adjusted net income (loss)   to evaluate the Company's operating performance, and to plan and forecast its operations. The Company believes the use of   Adjusted net income (loss)   reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. Management's determination of the components of   Adjusted net income (loss  ) are evaluated periodically and are based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Tax impacts of adjustments are determined based on the statutory tax rates and the Company s related tax attributes in each jurisdiction.   Adjusted net income (loss)   is reconciled to   Net income (loss)   in the table below: 

44 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
  Management uses   EBITDA   to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to plan and forecast its operations, and assess leverage levels and liquidity measures. The Company believes the use of   EBITDA   reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. In addition,   Adjusted EBITDA   is a measure used in the Company's Senior Notes due 2021 indenture to determine our ability to make certain payments and incur additional indebtedness.   EBITDA   and   Adjusted EBITDA   do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to,   Net income (Loss)   or   Cash Flow from Operations   as determined under GAAP.      Other companies may calculate   Adjusted EBITDA   differently and those calculations may not be comparable to our presentation.   Adjusted EBITDA   is reconciled to   Net income (loss)   in the table below: 

Costs Applicable to Sales and All-in Sustaining Costs 
    
  Management uses   Costs applicable to sales   ( CAS ) and   All-in sustaining costs   ( AISC ) to evaluate the Company s current operating performance and life of mine performance from discovery through reclamation.  We believe these measures assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing silver and gold, assessing our operating performance and ability to generate free cash flow from operations and sustaining production. These measures may not be indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.  Management believes converting the benefit from selling gold into silver equivalent ounces best allows management, analysts, investors and other stakeholders to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. Other companies may calculate CAS and AISC differently as a result of reflecting the benefit from selling non-silver metals as a by-product credit rather than converting to silver equivalent ounces, differences in the determination of sustaining capital expenditures, and differences in underlying accounting principles and accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards.

Item 3.            Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  The Company is exposed to various market risks as a part of its operations and engages in risk management strategies to mitigate these risks. The Company continually evaluates the potential benefits of engaging in these strategies based on current market conditions.  The Company does not actively engage in the practice of trading derivative instruments for profit.  Additional information about the Company s derivative financial instruments may be found in Note 11 -- Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  This discussion of the Company's market risk assessments contains  forward looking statements .  For additional information regarding forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company, please refer to Item 2 of this Report - Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  Actual results and actions could differ materially from those discussed below. 
  Gold and Silver Price 
  Gold and silver prices may fluctuate widely due to numerous factors such as U.S. dollar strength or weakness, demand, investor sentiment, inflation or deflation, and global mine production. The Company's profitability and cash flow may be significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold and silver. 
  Gold and Silver Hedging 
    To mitigate the risks associated with gold and silver price fluctuations, the Company may enter into option contracts to hedge future production.   
  If the market price of silver were to average less than the high strike price but more than the low strike price during the contract period, the Company would receive the difference between the average market price and the high strike price for the contracted volume over the contract period. If the market price of silver were to average less than the low strike price during the contract period, the Company would receive the difference between the average market price and the high strike price for the contracted volume over the contract period, and the Company would be required to pay the difference between the average market price and the low strike price for the contracted volume over the contract period.  The Company may be exposed to non-performance risk by counterparties as a result of its hedging activities. This exposure would be limited to the amount that the spot price of the metal falls short of the contract price. The Company had no outstanding gold and silver hedging contracts at   September 30, 2016  .   
  Provisional Silver and Gold Sales 
  The Company enters into sales contracts with third-party smelters and refiners which, in some cases, provide for a provisional payment based upon preliminary assays and quoted metal prices.  The provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract. Depending on the difference between the price at the time of sale and the final settlement price, embedded derivatives are recorded as either a derivative asset or liability.  The embedded derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, as a result, are marked to the market gold and silver price at the end of each period from the provisional sale date to the date of final settlement.  The mark-to-market gains and losses are recorded in earnings.  Changes in silver and gold pricing resulted in provisional pricing mark-to-market gains of $0.4 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of   0.3 million   ounces of silver and   24,449   ounces of gold at prices of   $19.35   and   $1,315  , respectively.  A 10% change in realized silver price would cause revenue to vary by $0.5 million and a 10% change in realized gold price would cause revenue to vary by $3.2 million.   
  Palmarejo Gold Production Royalty 
    On January 21, 2009, Coeur Mexicana entered into a gold production royalty transaction with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation.  The royalty covers 50% of the life of mine production from the Palmarejo mine and adjacent properties and includes a minimum obligation of 4,167 gold ounces per month which terminates when payments in respect of 400,000 gold ounces have been made.  The minimum royalty obligation is considered an embedded derivative financial instrument due to the impact of fluctuating gold prices on the underlying gold ounces. In July 2016, payments on the remaining ounces under the minimum royalty obligation were made and termination of the royalty was effective. 
  Foreign Currency 
  The Company operates, or has mineral interests, in several foreign countries including Australia, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, and New Zealand, which exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate risks.  Foreign currency exchange rates are influenced by world market factors beyond the Company's control such as supply and demand for U.S. and foreign currencies and related monetary and fiscal policies.  Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may significantly impact profitability and cash flow. 

50 

Foreign Exchange Hedging 
  To manage foreign currency risk, the Company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts when the Company believes such contracts would be beneficial. The Company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts at   September 30, 2016  .

Item 4.            Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a)   Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Based upon the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  (b)   Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  Based on an evaluation by the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, such officers concluded that there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
   
  Item 1.              Legal Proceedings 
  For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 20 -- Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 

Item 1A.          Risk Factors 
    
  Item 1A -- Risk Factors of the 2015 10-K and of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors have been supplemented and updated in this Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently know or that it currently deems immaterial also may impair our business operations. 
    
  The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in the countries in which it has significant operations or interests. 
    
  A significant portion of the Company s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and it is subject to significant risks inherent in mineral extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company s control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which the Company, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases, risks associated with the value-added tax ( VAT ) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups. 
       
  Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations. 
    
  The Company s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations.  Notwithstanding the Company s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  The Company s operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks. 
    
  In response to conflicts between local mining cooperatives and the Bolivian government, on September 1, 2016, the Bolivian government issued Supreme Decree No. 2891, which imposes tighter restrictions on mining cooperatives, including reversion of mining areas leased to the mining cooperatives by the Bolivian state-owned mining company, Corporacion Minera de Bolivia ( COMIBOL ) that are subject to joint venture agreements, leases or subleases with third parties to the Bolivian state. The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Empresa Minera Manquiri, S.A. ( Manquiri ) is currently party to various joint venture agreements with mining cooperatives (the  JV Agreements ) and has also entered in to mining contracts directly with COMIBOL (which are not impacted by the decree). Although Bolivian government officials have made public statements that the decree will not impact Manquiri s ability to continue operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements and the JV Agreements continue  
  
   53 

to be formally in existence, any cancellation of leases between COMIBOL and the applicable mining cooperatives and/or the JV Agreements will require negotiation of and entry into contracts directly with COMIBOL to continue mining operations at the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
    
  The Company has also been assessing the potential effects of the Bolivian mining law enacted in 2014 on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the regulations implementing the law are enacted. The law regulates royalties and provides for mining contracts with the government rather than concession holding. If the regulations promulgated under the new mining law mandate a renegotiation of the terms of our existing contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives, this could materially adversely affect the profitability and cash flow of our operations in Bolivia. 
    
  In addition, companies in Bolivia are also operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which provides for the reversion of mining rights if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights. The contracts with COMIBOL and the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403. In April 2014, Manquiri was served by the Bolivian government with a reversion decision affecting nine mining rights wholly-owned by Manquiri. The affected area is not in an area of active mining by Manquiri and the Manquiri s San Bartolom  operations were not targeted as an area of interest in the decision since all of our past and current mining activity is performed through our contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives. 
    
  On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. Manquiri holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL. The stability studies have been completed and officially submitted to the Bolivian mining technical authorities. Accordingly, the COMIBOL suspension has expired in accordance with the terms of the resolution. As a result of the resolution, Manquiri temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with whom Manquiri has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high grade material above the 4,400 meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the 4,400 meter level known as Huacajchi Sur. Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, Manquiri resumed limited mining operations at the San Bartolom  mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur. Despite the fact that the COMIBOL suspension has expired, Manquiri has not resumed mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level due to community relations concerns and the current political climate in Bolivia. 
    
  While the COMIBOL suspension has expired, it is uncertain at this time how long Manquiri will continue to suspend its mining operations in areas above the 4,400 meter level other than at Huacajchi and Huacajchi Sur. If COMIBOL decides to affirmatively adopt a new resolution to restrict access above the 4,400 meter level on a permanent basis, Manquiri may need to further write down the carrying value of the asset. While a portion of the Company's proven and probable reserves relate to material above the 4,400 meter level at San Bartolom , so long as operations remain suspended, there is a risk that silver may not be produced from this material at expected levels or at all, particularly given the remaining anticipated mine life of this asset.  
    
  It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.
