1.  
  Organization:       Potomac Futures Fund L.P. (the  Partnership )
is a limited partnership organized on March 14, 1997 under the partnership laws of the State of New York to engage, directly and indirectly, in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of commodity interests including futures, option, swap
and forward contracts. The sectors traded include currencies, energy, grains, indices, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, livestock, metals and softs. The commodity interests that are indirectly traded by the Partnership through its investment in CMF
Campbell Master Fund L.P. (the  Master ) are volatile and involve a high degree of market risk. The General Partner (defined below) may also determine to invest up to all of the Partnership s assets in United States ( U.S. )
Treasury bills and/or money market mutual funds, including money market mutual funds managed by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates. The Partnership is authorized to sell an unlimited number of redeemable units of limited partnership interest
( Redeemable Units ). The Partnership privately and continuously offers Redeemable Units in the Partnership to qualified investors. There is no maximum number of Redeemable Units that may be sold by the Partnership.  
 Ceres Managed Futures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, acts as the general partner (the  General Partner )
and commodity pool operator of the Partnership. The General Partner is wholly owned by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC ( MSSB Holdings ). MSSB Holdings is ultimately owned by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley is a publicly held
company whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley is engaged in various financial services and other businesses. Prior to June 28, 2013, Morgan Stanley indirectly owned a majority equity interest in MSSB Holdings and
Citigroup Inc. indirectly owned a minority equity interest in MSSB Holdings. Prior to July 31, 2009, the date as of which MSSB Holdings became its owner, the General Partner was wholly owned by Citigroup Financial Products Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., the sole owner of which is Citigroup Inc. All trading decisions for the Partnership are made by Campbell   Company, Inc. (the  Advisor ).  
 On January 1, 2005, the Partnership allocated substantially all of its capital to the Master, a limited partnership organized
under the partnership laws of the State of New York. The Partnership purchased 173,788.6446 units of the Master with cash equal to $172,205,653 and a contribution of open commodity futures and forward contracts with a fair value of $1,582,992. The
units of the Master are used solely for accounting purposes and do not represent legally distinct units. The Master permits accounts managed by the Advisor using the Campbell Managed Futures Portfolio (formerly, Financial, Metal and Energy Large
Portfolio), a proprietary, systematic trading program, to invest together in one trading vehicle. The General Partner is also the general partner of the Master. Individual and pooled accounts currently managed by the Advisor, including the
Partnership, are permitted to be limited partners of the Master. The General Partner and the Advisor believe that trading through this  master/feeder  structure promotes efficiency and economy in the trading process. Expenses to investors
as a result of the investment in the Master are approximately the same as they would be if the Partnership traded directly and redemption rights are not affected.  
 The General Partner is not aware of any material changes to the trading program discussed above during the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2016.    As of March 22, 2016, the Partnership began offering two classes of limited partnership
interests, Class A Redeemable Units and Class Z Redeemable Units. All Redeemable Units issued prior to February 29, 2016 were deemed  Class A Redeemable Units.  The rights, liabilities, risks, and fees associated with investment in the
Class A Redeemable Units were not changed. Class A Redeemable Units are available to taxable U.S. individuals and institutions, U.S. tax exempt individuals and institutions, and non-U.S. investors. Class Z Redeemable Units were first issued on July
1, 2016 at $1,000 per Redeemable Unit. Class Z Redeemable Units are offered to limited partners who receive advisory services from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and may also be offered to certain employees of Morgan Stanley and/or its
subsidiaries (and their family members). Class A Redeemable Units and Class Z Units are identical, except that Class Z Redeemable Units are not subject to monthly ongoing selling agent fees.  
 Generally, a limited partner in the Master withdraws all or part of its capital contribution and undistributed profits, if
any, from the Master as of the end of any month (the  Redemption Date ) after a request has been made to the General Partner at least three days in advance of the Redemption Date. Such withdrawals are classified as a liability when the
limited partner in the Master elects to redeem and informs the Master. However, a limited partner in the Master may request a withdrawal as of the end of any day if such request is received by the General Partner at least three days in advance of
the proposed withdrawal day.

  During the reporting periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Partnership s and the Master s commodity broker was Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. ), a registered futures commission merchant. The Partnership and the Master also deposit a portion of their cash in a non-trading
account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership owned 100% of the
Master. The Partnership intends to continue to invest substantially all of its assets in the Master. The performance of the Partnership is directly affected by the performance of the Master. The Master s trading of futures, forward, swap and
option contracts, if applicable, on commodities is done primarily on U.S. and foreign commodity exchanges. The Master engages in such trading through a commodity brokerage account maintained with MS Co. The Master s Statements of Financial
Condition, including Condensed Schedules of Investments and Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital, are included herein.  
 The Master has entered into a foreign exchange brokerage account agreement and a futures brokerage account agreement with
MS Co. The Partnership has also entered into a futures brokerage account agreement with MS Co. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, pays MS Co. (or will reimburse MS Co., if previously paid) its allocable share of
all trading fees for the clearing and, where applicable, execution of transactions as well as exchange, clearing, user, give-up, floor brokerage and National Futures Association fees (collectively, the  clearing fees ).  
 The Partnership has also entered into a selling agreement with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (doing business as Morgan
Stanley Wealth Management) ( Morgan Stanley Wealth Management ) (as amended, the  Selling Agreement ). Pursuant to the Selling Agreement, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management receives a monthly ongoing selling agent fee equal to 2.0%
per year of the Partnership s adjusted month-end net assets for Class A Redeemable Units. Class Z Redeemable Units are not subject to the ongoing selling agent fee. The ongoing selling agent fee received by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management will
be shared with the properly registered/licensed financial advisors of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management who sell Redeemable Units in the Partnership.  
 In July 2015, the General Partner delegated certain administrative functions to SS C Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, currently doing business as SS C GlobeOp (the  Administrator ). Pursuant to a Master Services Agreement, the Administrator furnishes certain administrative, accounting, regulatory reporting, tax and other services as
agreed from time to time. In addition, the Administrator maintains certain books and records of the Partnership. The cost of retaining the Administrator is allocated among the pools operated by the General Partner, including the Partnership.  

2.  
  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:     
 The accompanying financial statements and accompanying notes are unaudited but, in the opinion of the General Partner, include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership s financial condition at September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and the changes in partners  capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements present the results for interim periods and do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual
financial statements. These financial statements should be read together with the financial statements and notes included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
for the year ended December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2015 information has been derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Due to the nature of commodity trading, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered
indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.

  Notes to Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)       
   Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements and
accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.  
  Profit Allocation.  The General Partner and each limited partner of the Partnership share in the profits and losses of
the Partnership in proportion to the amount of Partnership interest owned by each, except that no limited partner is liable for obligations of the Partnership in excess of its capital contributions and profits, if any, net of distributions or
redemptions and losses, if any.     Statement of Cash Flows.  The Partnership is not required to provide a Statement of
Cash Flows.     Partnership s Investment.  The Partnership carries its investment in the Master at fair value
based on the Master s net asset value per Redeemable Unit as calculated by the Master. The valuation of the Master s investments including the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the investments held by the Master are
described in Note 5,  Fair Value Measurements.      Master s Investments.  All commodity interests of
the Master, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, are held for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on the trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as described in Note 5,
 Fair Value Measurements ) at the measurement date. Investments in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains or losses are
realized when contracts are liquidated and are determined using the first-in, first-out method. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account in the Master s Statements of Financial
Condition. Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized gains or losses are included in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital.  
  Master s Cash.  The Master s cash includes cash denominated in foreign currencies of ($18,276) and ($302,271)
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The cost of foreign currencies was ($18,260) and ($302,962) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The carrying value of the assets and liabilities presented in the Statements of
Financial Condition that qualify as financial instruments under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 825,   Financial Instruments,   approximates the fair
value due to the short term nature of such balances.     Investment Company Status.  Effective January 1, 2014, the
Partnership adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-08,   Financial Services Investment Companies (Topic 946):     Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements   and based on
the General Partner s assessment, the Partnership has been deemed to be an investment company since inception. Accordingly, the Partnership follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of Topic 946 and reflects its
investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  
  Income Taxes.  Income taxes have not been listed as each partner is individually liable for the taxes, if any, on its
share of the Partnership s income and expenses. The General Partner has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Partnership s financial statements. The Partnership files U.S. federal and various state and local tax
returns. No income tax returns are currently under examination. The 2012 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. The General Partner does not believe that there are any uncertain tax
positions that require recognition of a tax liability.

   Net Income (Loss) per Redeemable Unit.  Net income (loss) per
Redeemable Unit for each Class is calculated in accordance with ASC 946,   Financial Services   Investment Companies.   See Note 3,  Financial Highlights.   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncement.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments for all entities that hold financial assets or owe
financial liabilities. One of the amendments in this update eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial
instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet or a description of changes in the methods and significant assumptions. Additionally, the update eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at
amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. Investment companies are specifically exempted from ASU 2016-01 s equity investment accounting provisions and will continue to follow the industry specific guidance for
investment accounting under Topic 946. For public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. For other entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The General Partner is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Partnership s financial statements and related disclosures.  
 There have been no material changes with respect to the Partnership s critical accounting policies as reported in the
Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  Trading Activities:       The Partnership was formed for the purpose of
trading contracts in a variety of commodity interests, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets through a  master/feeder  structure. The
Partnership s pro rata share of the results of the Master s trading activities is shown in the Partnership s Statements of Income and Expenses.  
 The futures brokerage account agreements with MS Co. give the Partnership and the Master the legal right to net unrealized
gains and losses on open futures and on open forward contracts. The Master nets, for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures and on open forward contracts in the Statements of Financial Condition as the criteria
under ASC 210-20,   Balance Sheet   have been met.    Trading and transaction fees are based on the number of
trades executed by the Advisor for the Master. All clearing fees paid to MS Co. are borne by the Master and allocated to the Partnership.

September 30, 2016 and 2015, were 1,148 and 1,236, respectively. The monthly average number of metals forward contracts traded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 219 and 457, respectively. The monthly average number of
metals forward contracts traded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 279 and 481, respectively. The monthly average notional values of currency forward contracts held during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $205,968,375 and $304,427,503, respectively. The monthly average notional values of currency forward contracts held during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $265,147,825 and $337,390,511, respectively.  
 The following tables summarize the gross and net amounts relating to assets and liabilities of the Master s derivatives
and their offsetting subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.      

* 
   In the event of default by the Master, MS Co., the Master s commodity futures broker and the sole
counterparty to the Master s off-exchange-traded contracts, as applicable, has the right to offset the Master s obligation with the Master s cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills held by MS Co., thereby minimizing MS Co. s risk
of loss. There is no collateral posted by MS Co. and as such, in the event of default by MS Co., the Master is exposed to the amount shown in the Master s Statements of Financial Condition. In the case of exchange-traded contracts, the
Master s exposure to counterparty risk may be reduced since the exchange s clearinghouse interposes its credit between buyer and seller and the clearinghouse s guarantee may be available in the event of a default.

  Master s Fair Value Measurements.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.    The fair value of
exchange-traded futures, option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign
currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign
currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as input the spot prices, interest rates, and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately
3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period.

  The Master considers prices for exchange-traded commodity futures, forward,
swap and option contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1). The values of U.S. Treasury bills, non-exchange-traded forward, swap and certain option contracts for which market
quotations are not readily available are priced by broker quotes or pricing services that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Master did not hold any derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of the General Partner s assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level
3). Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. During the reporting periods, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2.

6.  
  Financial Instrument Risks:       In the normal course of business, the
Partnership, through its investment in the Master, is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include forwards,
futures, options and swaps, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific
terms on specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an
exchange, a swap execution facility or over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward, option and swap contracts. Certain swap contracts may also be traded on a swap execution
facility or OTC. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The
purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments,
including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. The General
Partner estimates at any given time approximately 20.4% to 42.8% of the Partnership s/Master s contracts are traded OTC.  
  Futures Contracts.  The Master trades futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a
specified quantity of investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, at a specified price on a specified future date, unless the contract is closed before the delivery date or the delivery quantity is something
where physical delivery cannot occur (such as the S P 500 Index), whereby such contract is settled in cash. Payments ( variation margin ) may be made or received by the Master each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Master. When the contract is closed, the Master records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was
opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, directly with the exchange
on which the contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital.  
  Forward Foreign Currency Contracts.  Forward foreign currency contracts are those contracts where the Master agrees to
receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are valued daily, and the Master s net equity therein, representing unrealized gain or loss on the
contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into the contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date, is included in the Master s Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized
gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency contracts are recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively, and are included in the Master s Statements of Income and
Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital.     London Metals Exchange Forward Contracts.  Metal contracts traded
on the London Metals Exchange ( LME ) represent a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin or zinc. LME contracts traded by the Master are cash settled based on prompt dates published by
the LME. Payments ( variation margin ) may be made or received by the Master on each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Master.
A contract is considered offset when all long positions have been matched with a like number of short positions settling on the same prompt date. When the contract is closed at the prompt date, the Master records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in LME contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin
deposits, through the broker, directly with the LME. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on metal contracts are included in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners 
Capital.

  The Master does not isolate the portion of the results of operations arising
from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations from changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in total trading results in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses
and Changes in Partners  Capital.    The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited
to the amount of their share of the Partnership s net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.  
 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Master due to market changes,
including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The Master is
exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of
a contract. The Partnership s/Master s risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts
of the instruments. The Partnership s/Master s risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Master to offset unrealized gains and losses and other
assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Master has credit risk and concentration risk, as MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate is the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the
Partnership s/Master s assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that, through MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate, the Partnership s/Master s counterparty is an exchange or
clearing organization.    The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership s/Master s risk
exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership/Master may be
subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account
analysis of futures, forward and options positions by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions.  
 The majority of these financial instruments mature within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the
Partnership s/Master s business, these instruments may not be held to maturity.      

7.  
  Subsequent Events:       The General Partner evaluates events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The General Partner has assessed the subsequent events through the date of issuance and determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in
the financial statements.

     Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.      Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. The Partnership s only assets are its investment in the
Master and cash. The Master does not engage in sales of goods or services. The Master s only assets are its equity in trading account, consisting of cash, cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized
appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses
to the Partnership, through its investment in the Master. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the third quarter of 2016.  
 The Partnership s capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners, as increased or decreased by income
(loss) from its investment in the Master, expenses, interest income, subscriptions, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Partnership s capital decreased 27.4% from $26,761,029 to $19,429,253. This
decrease was attributable to the net loss of $2,377,568, coupled with the redemptions of 3,429.1810 Class A Limited Partner Redeemable Units totaling $5,087,608 and redemptions of 192.5786 Class A General Partner Redeemable Units totaling $289,508
and redemptions of 36.6440 Class Z General Partner Redeemable Units totaling $35,000, which was partially offset by the subscriptions of 128.0540 Class A Limited Partner Redeemable Units totaling $193,400 and subscriptions of 264.5080 Class Z
General Partner Redeemable Units totaling $264,508. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in the Master in subsequent periods.  
 The Master s capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by realized and/or
unrealized gains or losses on trading, expenses, interest income, subscriptions, redemptions of units and distributions of profits, if any.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Master s capital decreased 26.4% from $27,017,432 to $19,889,268. This
decrease was attributable to the net loss of $1,272,625, coupled with the redemptions of 3,038.1627 Redeemable Units totaling $6,028,773 and the distribution of interest income to feeder funds totaling $20,166, which was partially offset by the
subscriptions of 96.6439 Redeemable Units totaling $193,400. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in funds in subsequent periods.  
  Critical Accounting Policies   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The General Partner
believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2,
 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  of the financial statements.    The
Partnership records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net changes in unrealized gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and Expenses.

   Results of Operations   
 During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Class A Redeemable Unit decreased 5.0% from
$1,492.99 to $1,418.84, as compared to an increase of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2015. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Class Z Redeemable Unit decreased 4.5% from $1,000.00 to $955.12. The Partnership,
through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2016 of $658,146. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy,
indices, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, and livestock and were partially offset by gains in grains, metals, and softs. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the third
quarter of 2015 of $1,267,158. Gains were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, indices, livestock, and non-U.S. interest rates and were partially offset by losses in grains, metals, softs
and U.S. interest rates.    The most significant losses were incurred within the global interest rate sector during August
from long positions in U.S. fixed income futures as prices declined as U.S. Federal Reserve ( Fed ) Chair Janet Yellen s hawkish comments on U.S. monetary policy bolstered speculation that the central bank could raise interest rates
in the coming months. Additional losses in this sector were recorded from long global fixed income futures positions as uncertainty and nervousness over central bank interest rate decisions drove prices lower during the first half of September.
In the currency sector, losses were recorded during the third quarter from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the euro rebounded after concern regarding the U.K. referendum vote to leave the E.U. subsided and
the relative value of the dollar decreased during late September following the Fed meeting decision not to tighten monetary policy. Within the energy complex, losses were incurred during August and September from short positions in crude oil
and its related products as prices increased after reports surfaced and were confirmed that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) would curtail oil production. Losses within the metals complex were experienced
primarily during August from long positions in precious metals futures as prices moved lower due to weakening investor demand. The Partnership s losses for the quarter were partially offset by gains achieved within the global stock index
sector during July as prices rose after investors looked past geopolitical concerns and focused on better-than-expected economic fundamental data. Within the agricultural markets, gains were experienced during August from short positions in wheat
and corn futures as prices moved lower as positive weather conditions in the world s grain growing regions added to a global supply glut. Additional gains were achieved in the agriculturals during September from long positions in sugar futures
as prices moved higher due to unfavorable growing conditions threatening crop yields in Brazil and India, the world s largest sugar cane growers.  
 During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Class A Redeemable Unit decreased
9.7% from $1,571.03 to $1,418.84 as compared to a decrease of 5.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Class Z Redeemable Unit decreased 4.5% from
$1,000.00 to $955.12. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,146,434. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master s
trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, indices, U.S. interest rates, livestock, metals and softs and were partially offset by gains in grains and non-U.S. interest rates. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master,
experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $151,411. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of commodity futures in energy, grains, U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates, metals and softs and were partially offset by gains in currencies, indices and livestock.

  The most significant losses were incurred within the energy complex during March
and May from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices rallied as U.S. crude production continued to decline. Additional losses in this complex were experienced during April and June from short positions in natural gas futures
as prices increased after warmer-than-expected weather in the U.S. spurred speculation of a tightening market. Further losses in the energies were incurred during August and September from short positions crude oil and its related products. In
the currency sector, losses were recorded during February from short positions in the Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Japanese yen as the relative value of the U.S. dollar weakened amid concern of growing vulnerability of the U.S. economy.
During April, losses in currencies were recorded from short positions in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar after the pound strengthened as fears the United Kingdom might vote to exit the E.U. began to prematurely subside. During May,
losses were incurred from short U.S. dollar positions against a variety of currencies after the dollar steadily strengthened. During June, losses were recorded in the currency markets from positioning in the euro due to choppy price action
leading up to and after the decision of the U.K. to leave the E.U. During August losses in this sector were experienced from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar. Within the metals complex, losses were incurred during January and
February from short precious metals positions as prices increased as uncertainty in Chinese financial markets, plunging oil prices, and signs of softening U.S. economic growth all bolstered the safe haven appeal of the metals. Additional losses in
this sector were recorded during February and March from short base metals futures positions as prices rose due to a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar and optimism that demand would improve after the Chinese government signaled increased
support for economic stimulus. Further losses within the metals were incurred during May and August from long positions in precious metals futures positions as prices declined. Within the global stock indices, losses were experienced during
January from long positions amid a steep sell-off in equities as global growth concerns persisted to start the New Year. During April, further losses were incurred from short global equity index futures positions as prices moved higher as
commodity prices bounced and global central banks continued to provide an accommodative backdrop for stocks. Additional losses in this sector were recorded during June from global equity index futures positions as priced moved lower and September as
prices fluctuated amid speculation surrounding global central bank activity and its consequential effects on the marketplace. In the agricultural markets, losses were recorded during January from short corn futures positions as prices rose after a
strong U.S. export sales report and adverse weather conditions in Brazil. Additional losses in this sector were incurred during March from short wheat and soybean futures positions. Further losses in these markets were incurred during the first
half of the April from long sugar futures positions, and during May from long futures positions in cocoa. The Partnership s losses for the first nine months of the year were partially offset by gains achieved within the global interest
rates sector during January and February primarily from long European bond futures positions as prices increased following dovish comments released by the European Central Bank and a flight-to-quality due to global growth concerns. Further gains
from long European bond futures positions were recorded during May. In June, additional gains were achieved within this sector from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices advanced as uncertainty surrounding the
economic and political fallout following the U.K. s vote to leave the E.U. increased demand for the relative  safety  of government debt.

  Commodity markets are highly volatile. The potential for broad and rapid price
fluctuations increases the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increase the possibility of profit. The profitability of the Partnership (and the Master) depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisor to
correctly identify those price trends. Price trends are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international
political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisor is able to identify them, the Partnership and the Master expects to increase capital through operations.  
 Interest income on 80% of the Partnership s average daily equity maintained in cash allocated to it by the Master during
each month was earned at a rate equal to the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. All interest earned on U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities will be retained by the Partnership and/or the Master, as
applicable. Any interest earned on the Partnership s account in excess of the amount described above, if any, will be retained by MS Co. and/or shared with the General Partner. Interest income allocated from the Master for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $11,286 and $33,904, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher 4-week U.S.Treasury bill discount rates along with
additional interest income earned on U.S. Treasury bills during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the
Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on (1) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s (or the Partnership s allocable portion of the Master s) account, (2) the amount of
Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and/or the Master, and (3) interest rates over which none of the Partnership, the Master or MS Co. has no control.  
 Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value of Class A
Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $31,436 and $84,153, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease in ongoing selling agent fees is due to a decrease in average net assets attributable
to Class A Redeemable Units during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  
 Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net assets per Class as of the end of each
month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
decreased by $22,463 and $61,822, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease in management fees is due to a decrease in average net assets per Class during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.    General Partner fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the
business and affairs of the Partnership including, among other things, (i) selecting, appointing and terminating the Partnership s commodity trading advisor and (ii) monitoring the activities of the commodity trading advisor. These fees are
calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net assets per Class as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations
in monthly net asset values. General Partner fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $14,975 and $41,211, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease in General Partner fees is due to
a decrease in average net assets per Class during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  
 Incentive fees are based on the new trading profits generated by the Advisor at the end of the quarter, as defined in the
advisory agreement between the Partnership, the General Partner and the Advisor. There were no incentive fees earned for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Trading performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015
resulted in incentive fees of $0 and $84,431, respectively. To the extent the Advisor incurs a loss for the Partnership, the Advisor will not be paid incentive fees until the Advisor recovers any net loss incurred by the Advisor and earns additional
new trading profits for the Partnership.    In allocating substantially all of the assets of the Partnership to the Master,
the General Partner considers, among other things, the Advisor s past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets among the Advisors at any
time.

     Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
    All or substantially all of the Partnership s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its
investment in the Master. The Partnership and the Master are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by the Master are acquired for speculative trading purposes. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive
instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Master s and the Partnership s main line of business.    The
limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment.    Market
movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Master s open contracts and, consequently, in its earnings and cash balances. The Master s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and
volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Master s open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.  
 The Master rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently,
it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Master s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.  
  Value at Risk  is a measure of the maximum amount which the Master could reasonably be expected to lose in a given
market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Master s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Master of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far
beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Master s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification
in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Master s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Master s attempts to manage its market risk.  
 Exchange margin requirements have been used by the Master as the measure of its Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by
exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies
as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price
fluctuation.

     Item 4.   Controls and Procedures   
 The Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Partnership on the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports it files is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and
Chief Financial Officer (the  CFO ) of the General Partner, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.  
 The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining
and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Partnership s external disclosures.    The General
Partner s President and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016, and, based on that
evaluation, the General Partner s President and CFO have concluded that, at that date, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
 The Partnership s  internal control over financial reporting  is a process under the supervision of the General
Partner s President and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that:  

pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership;    

provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and (ii) the Partnership s receipts are handled and expenditures
are made only pursuant to authorizations of the General Partner; and        

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.      There were no changes in the Partnership s  internal control over financial
reporting  process during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1.   Legal Proceedings   
 This section describes the major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business,
to which MS Co. or its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject. There are no material legal proceedings pending against the Partnership or the General Partner.  
 On June 1, 2011, Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited
liability company. As a result of that conversion, Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated is now named Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. ).  
 MS Co. is a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a Delaware holding company. Morgan Stanley files periodic
reports with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act, which include current descriptions of material litigation and material proceedings and investigations, if any, by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations
concerning Morgan Stanley and its subsidiaries, including MS Co. As a consolidated subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, MS Co. does not file its own periodic reports with the SEC that contain descriptions of material litigation, proceedings and
investigations. As a result, please refer to the  Legal Proceedings  section of Morgan Stanley s SEC 10-K filings for 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. In addition, MS Co. annually prepares an Audited, Consolidated Statement of
Financial Condition ( Audited Financial Statement ) that is publicly available on Morgan Stanley s website at  www.morganstanley.com . Please refer to the Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies   Legal section of
MS Co. s 2015 Audited Financial Statement.    In addition to the matters described in those filings, in the normal
course of business, each of Morgan Stanley and MS Co. has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global
diversified financial services institution. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Each of Morgan Stanley and MS Co. is also involved, from
time to time, in investigations and proceedings by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, fines or penalties. The number of these investigations and proceedings has
increased in recent years with regard to many financial services institutions, including Morgan Stanley and MS Co.  
 MS Co. is a Delaware limited liability company with its main business office located at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York
10036. Among other registrations and memberships, MS Co. is registered as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association.  
   Regulatory and Governmental Matters         
 MS Co. has received subpoenas and requests for information from certain federal and state regulatory and governmental
entities, including among others various members of the RMBS Working Group of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, such as the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and several state Attorney General s Offices, concerning
the origination, financing, purchase, securitization and servicing of subprime and non-subprime residential mortgages and related matters such as residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), collateralized debt obligations
( CDOs ), structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) and credit default swaps backed by or referencing mortgage pass-through certificates. These matters, some of which are in advanced stages, include, but are not limited to,
investigations related to MS Co. s due diligence on the loans that it purchased for securitization, MS Co. s communications with ratings agencies, MS Co. s disclosures to investors, and MS Co. s handling of
servicing and foreclosure related issues.    On February 25, 2015, MS Co. reached an agreement in principle with
the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and the United States Attorney s Office for the Northern District of California, Civil Division (collectively, the  Civil Division ) to pay $2.6 billion to resolve certain claims
that the Civil Division indicated it intended to bring against MS Co. That settlement was finalized on February 10, 2016.

  On April 1, 2016, the California Attorney General s Office filed an
action against MS Co. and certain affiliates in California state court styled  California v. Morgan Stanley, et al. , on behalf of California investors, including the California Public Employees  Retirement System and the California
Teachers  Retirement System. The complaint alleges that MS Co. made misrepresentations and omissions regarding residential mortgage-backed securities and notes issued by the Cheyne SIV (defined below), and asserts violations of the
California False Claims Act and other state laws and seeks treble damages, civil penalties, disgorgement, and injunctive relief. On July 20, 2016, MS Co. filed a demurrer, which was granted on September 30, 2016. On October 21,
2016, the California Attorney General filed an amended complaint.    In October 2014, the Illinois Attorney
General s Office ( ILAG ) sent a letter to MS Co. alleging that MS Co. knowingly made misrepresentations related to RMBS purchased by certain pension funds affiliated with the State of Illinois and demanding that MS Co.
pay ILAG approximately $88 million. MS Co. and ILAG reached an agreement to resolve the matter on February 10, 2016.  
 On January 13, 2015, the New York Attorney General s Office ( NYAG ), which is also a member of the RMBS
Working Group, indicated that it intended to file a lawsuit related to approximately 30 subprime securitizations sponsored by MS Co. NYAG indicated that the lawsuit would allege that MS Co. misrepresented or omitted material information
related to the due diligence, underwriting and valuation of the loans in the securitizations and the properties securing them and indicated that its lawsuit would be brought under the Martin Act. MS Co. and NYAG reached an agreement to resolve
the matter on February 10, 2016.    On June 5, 2012, MS Co. consented to and became the subject of an Order
Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) to resolve allegations related to
the failure of a salesperson to comply with exchange rules that prohibit off-exchange futures transactions unless there is an Exchange for Related Position ( EFRP ). Specifically, the CFTC found that from April 2008 through October 2009,
MS Co. violated Section 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulation 1.38 by executing, processing and reporting numerous off-exchange futures trades to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) and Chicago Board of Trade
( CBOT ) as EFRPs in violation of CME and CBOT rules because those trades lacked the corresponding and related cash, OTC swap, OTC option, or other OTC derivative position. In addition, the CFTC found that MS Co. violated CFTC
Regulation 166.3 by failing to supervise the handling of the trades at issue and failing to have adequate policies and procedures designed to detect and deter the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations. Without admitting or
denying the underlying allegations and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS Co. accepted and consented to entry of findings and the imposition of a cease and desist order, a fine of $5,000,000, and undertakings related to public
statements, cooperation and payment of the fine. MS Co. entered into corresponding and related settlements with the CME and CBOT in which the CME found that MS Co. violated CME Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined MS Co. $750,000 and CBOT found
that MS Co. violated CBOT Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined MS Co. $1,000,000.    On July 23, 2014, the SEC
approved a settlement by MS Co. and certain affiliates to resolve an investigation related to certain subprime RMBS transactions sponsored and underwritten by those entities in 2007. Pursuant to the settlement, MS Co. and certain
affiliates were charged with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, agreed to pay disgorgement and penalties in an amount of $275 million and neither admitted nor denied the SEC s findings.  
 On April 21, 2015, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated ( CBOE ) and the CBOE Futures Exchange, LLC
( CFE ) filed statements of charges against MS Co. in connection with trading by one of MS Co. s former traders of EEM options contracts that allegedly disrupted the final settlement price of the November 2012 VXEM
futures. CBOE alleged that MS Co. violated CBOE Rules 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. CFE alleged that MS Co. violated CFE Rules 608, 609 and 620. The matters were
resolved on June 28, 2016 without any findings of fraud.

  On June 18, 2015, MS Co. entered into a settlement with the SEC and paid
a fine of $500,000 as part of the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative to resolve allegations that MS Co. failed to form a reasonable basis through adequate due diligence for believing the truthfulness of the assertions by
issuers and/or obligors regarding their compliance with previous continuing disclosure undertakings pursuant to Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act in connection with offerings in which MS Co. acted as senior or sole underwriter. 
 On August 6, 2015, MS Co. consented to and became the subject of an order by the CFTC to resolve allegations that
MS Co. violated CFTC Regulation 22.9(a) by failing to hold sufficient U.S. dollars in cleared swap segregated accounts in the United States to meet all U.S. dollar obligations to cleared swaps customers. Specifically, the CFTC found that while
MS Co. at all times held sufficient funds in segregation to cover its obligations to its customers, on certain days during 2013 and 2014, it held currencies, such as euros, instead of U.S. dollars, to meet its U.S. dollar obligations. In
addition, the CFTC found that MS Co. violated CFTC Regulation 166.3 by failing to have in place adequate procedures to ensure that it complied with CFTC Regulation 22.9(a). Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions and
without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS Co. accepted and consented to the entry of findings, the imposition of a cease and desist order, a civil monetary penalty of $300,000, and undertakings related to public statements,
cooperation, and payment of the monetary penalty.      Civil Litigation    
 On December 23, 2009, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle filed a complaint against MS Co. and another
defendant in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, styled  Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Morgan Stanley   Co. Inc., et al.  The amended complaint, filed on September 28, 2010, alleges that defendants made
untrue statements and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by
MS Co. was approximately $233 million. The complaint raises claims under the Washington State Securities Act and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff s purchase of such certificates. By orders dated June
23, 2011 and July 18, 2011, the court denied defendants  omnibus motion to dismiss plaintiff s amended complaint and on August 15, 2011, the court denied MS Co. s individual motion to dismiss the amended
complaint. On March 7, 2013, the court granted defendants  motion to strike plaintiff s demand for a jury trial. The defendants  joint motions for partial summary judgment were denied on November 9, 2015. At
September 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in this action was approximately $43 million, and the certificates had not yet incurred actual losses. Based on currently available information,
MS Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference between the $43 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a judgment against MS Co., plus pre-
and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.  
 On March 15, 2010, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco filed a complaint against MS Co. and other defendants
in the Superior Court of the State of California styled  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. et al.  An amended complaint, filed on June 10, 2010, alleges that defendants made untrue
statements and material omissions in connection with the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The amount of certificates allegedly sold to
plaintiff by MS Co. was approximately $276 million. The complaint raises claims under both the federal securities laws and California law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff s purchase of such
certificates. On August 11, 2011, plaintiff s federal securities law claims were dismissed with prejudice. On February 9, 2012, defendants  demurrers with respect to all other claims were overruled. On December 20,
2013, plaintiff s negligent misrepresentation claims were dismissed with prejudice. At September 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in these cases was approximately $52 million, and the
certificates had incurred actual losses of approximately $2 million. Based on currently available information, MS Co. believes it could incur a loss for this action up to the difference between the $55 million unpaid balance of these
certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a judgment against MS Co., or upon sale, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these
losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.

  On July 15, 2010, China Development Industrial Bank ( CDIB ) filed
a complaint against MS Co., styled  China Development Industrial Bank v. Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated et al ., which is pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County ( Supreme Court of NY ).
The complaint relates to a $275 million credit default swap referencing the super senior portion of the STACK 2006-1 CDO. The complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that

related to the approximately $228 million that CDIB alleges it has already lost under the credit default swap, rescission of CDIB s obligation to pay an additional $12 million, punitive damages, equitable relief, fees and costs. On

loans and asserts claims under Illinois law. The total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by MS Co. at issue in the action was approximately $203 million. The complaint seeks, among other things, to
rescind the plaintiff s purchase of such certificates. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the corrected amended complaint on May 27, 2011, which was denied on September 19, 2012. On December 13, 2013, the court entered
an order dismissing all claims related to one of the securitizations at issue. After that dismissal, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS Co. or sold to plaintiff by MS Co. was approximately $78 million. At

and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS Co. or sold to plaintiff
by MS Co. was approximately $385 million. The amended complaint raises claims under the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act and common law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff s
purchase of such certificates. On May 26, 2011, defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The defendants  motions to dismiss the amended complaint were granted in part and denied in
part on September 30, 2013. On November 25, 2013, July 16, 2014, and May 19, 2015, respectively, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against MS Co. with respect to three of the securitizations at issue. After these
voluntary dismissals, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS Co. or sold to plaintiff by MS Co. was approximately $332 million. At September 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through
certificates at issue in this action was approximately $52 million, and the certificates had not yet incurred actual losses. Based on currently available information, MS Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference

     Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were additional subscriptions of 112.1080 Class A Redeemable
Units totaling $170,000 and 264.5080 Class Z Redeemable Units totaling $264,508. The Redeemable Units were issued in reliance upon applicable exemptions from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The Redeemable Units were purchased by accredited investors as described in Regulation D. In determining the applicability of the exemption, the General Partner relied on the fact that the Redeemable Units
were purchased by accredited investors in a private offering.    Proceeds from the sale of Redeemable Units are used in the
trading of commodity interests, including futures contracts, options, forward and swap contracts.    The following chart
sets forth the purchases of limited partner Redeemable Units for each Class by the Partnership.      

* 
   Generally, limited partners are permitted to redeem their Redeemable Units as of the end of each month on
three business days  notice to the General Partner. Under certain circumstances, the General Partner can compel redemption, although to date the General Partner has not exercised this right. Purchases of Redeemable Units by the Partnership
reflected in the chart above were made in the ordinary course of the Partnership s business in connection with effecting redemptions for limited partners.     

** 
   Redemptions of Redeemable Units are effected as of the end of each month at the net asset value per Redeemable
Unit as of that day. No fee will be charged for redemptions.          Item 3.      Defaults
Upon Senior Securities    None.       Item 4.      Mine Safety Disclosures    Not Applicable.
