PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

ITEM 1   CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  We have prepared the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Lear Corporation and subsidiaries pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading when read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The financial information presented reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, cash flows and financial position for the interim periods presented. These results are not necessarily indicative of a full year s results of operations.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(  1  )   Basis of Presentation    
  Lear Corporation ("Lear," and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company") and its affiliates design and manufacture automotive seating and electrical distribution systems and related components. The Company s main customers are automotive original equipment manufacturers. The Company operates facilities worldwide. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lear, a Delaware corporation, and the wholly owned and less than wholly owned subsidiaries controlled by Lear. In addition, Lear consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities, in which it has a controlling financial interest. Investments in affiliates in which Lear does not have control, but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. 
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of   100%   of the outstanding equity interests of Everett Smith Group, Ltd., the parent company of Eagle Ottawa, LLC ("Eagle Ottawa"). The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. For further information on the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa, see Note 3,  Acquisition,  to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The Company s annual financial results are reported on a calendar year basis, and quarterly interim results are reported using a thirteen week reporting calendar. 
  Certain amounts in the prior period s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the quarter ended   October 1, 2016  . 
  Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Cost of sales includes material, labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacture and distribution of the Company s products. Distribution costs include inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs of the Company s distribution network. Selling, general and administrative expenses include selling, engineering and development and administrative costs not directly associated with the manufacture and distribution of the Company s products. 

(  2  )   Restructuring    
  Restructuring costs include employee termination benefits, fixed asset impairment charges and contract termination costs, as well as other incremental costs resulting from the restructuring actions. These incremental costs principally include equipment and personnel relocation costs. The Company also incurs incremental manufacturing inefficiency costs at the operating locations impacted by the restructuring actions during the related restructuring implementation period. Restructuring costs are recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Generally, charges are recorded as restructuring actions are approved and/or implemented. 
  In the first   nine months of     2016  , the Company recorded charges of   $51.2 million   in connection with its restructuring actions. These charges consist of   $44.6 million   recorded as cost of sales and   $6.6 million   recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring charges consist of employee termination benefits of   $45.4 million  , fixed asset impairment charges of   $3.5 million   and net contract termination credits of   $0.3 million  , as well as other related costs of   $2.6 million  . Employee termination benefits were recorded based on existing union and employee contracts, statutory requirements, completed negotiations and Company policy. Fixed asset impairment charges relate to the disposal of buildings, leasehold improvements and/or machinery and equipment with carrying values of   $3.5 million   in excess of related estimated fair values. The Company expects to incur approximately   $50 million   of additional restructuring costs related to activities initiated as of   October 1, 2016  , and expects that the components of such costs will be consistent with its historical experience. Any future restructuring actions will depend upon market conditions, customer actions and other factors.

A summary of   2016   activity is shown below (in millions):   

(  3  )   Inventories    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. A summary of inventories is shown below (in millions):   

(  4  )   Pre-Production Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Agreements    
  The Company incurs pre-production engineering and development ("E D") and tooling costs related to the products produced for its customers under long-term supply agreements. The Company expenses all pre-production E D costs for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer. In addition, the Company expenses all pre-production tooling costs related to customer-owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the Company does not have a non-cancelable right to use the tooling. 
  During the first   nine months of     2016   and   2015  , the Company capitalized   $110.5 million   and   $115.9 million  , respectively, of pre-production E D costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer. During the first   nine months of     2016   and   2015  , the Company also capitalized     $61.5 million   and   $74.8 million  , respectively, of pre-production tooling costs related to customer-owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the Company has a non-cancelable right to use the tooling. These amounts are included in other current and long-term assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  During the first   nine months of     2016   and   2015  , the Company collected   $168.9 million   and   $155.6 million  , respectively, of cash related to E D and tooling costs. 
  The classification of recoverable customer E D and tooling costs related to long-term supply agreements is shown below (in millions):

(  5  )   Long-Term Assets    
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Costs associated with the repair and maintenance of the Company s property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the Company s property, plant and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. Depreciable property is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using principally the straight-line method. 
  A summary of property, plant and equipment is shown below (in millions):   

  Depreciation expense was   $83.5 million   and   $75.0 million   in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, and   $241.7 million   and   $217.9 million   in the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company monitors its long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis in accordance with GAAP. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. Except as discussed below, the Company does not believe that there were any indicators that would have resulted in long-lived asset impairment charges as of   October 1, 2016  . The Company will, however, continue to assess the impact of any significant industry events on the realization of its long-lived assets. 
  In the first   nine months of     2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized fixed asset impairment charges of   $3.5 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, in conjunction with its restructuring actions (Note   2  , "  Restructuring  "). In the first   nine months of     2015  , the Company also recognized additional fixed asset impairment charges of   $0.5 million  .  
  Investment in Affiliates 
  On June 21, 2016, the Company gained control of Beijing BAI Lear Automotive Systems Co., Ltd. ( Beijing BAI ) by amending the existing joint venture agreement to eliminate the substantive participating rights of its joint venture partner. Prior to the amendment, Beijing BAI was accounted for under the equity method. The consolidation of Beijing BAI was accounted for as a business combination, and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   October 1, 2016  . The operating results and cash flows of Beijing BAI are reflected in the Company s seating segment in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the amended joint venture agreement. 
  A preliminary summary of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with the consolidation is shown below (in millions):

     Table of Contents  
  LEAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Continued) 

Intangible assets consist of amounts recognized for the fair value of customer-based assets and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include Beijing BAI s established relationships with its customers and the expectation of these relationships generating future economic profits for the Company. It is currently estimated that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately   eight   years. Recognized goodwill is attributable to the assembled workforce, expected synergies and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. 
  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with the consolidation contain provisional estimates that may be revised as a result of additional information obtained regarding such assets and liabilities. 
  As of the date of consolidation, the fair value of the Company s previously held equity interest in Beijing BAI was   $63.0 million  , and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in Beijing BAI was   $41.0 million  . As a result of valuing the Company s previously held equity interest in Beijing BAI at fair value, the Company recognized a gain of   $30.3 million   in the nine months ended October 1, 2016. 
  The pro forma effects of the consolidation would not materially impact the Company s reported results for any period presented. 
  For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value see Note   15  , "  Financial Instruments  ." 

(  6  )   Goodwill    
  A summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by operating segment, in the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , is shown below (in millions):   

            (1)   
    In the third quarter of 2016, the Company changed the name of its electrical operating segment to E-Systems. 
     Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The Company conducts its annual impairment testing as of the first day of its fourth quarter. 
  The Company does not believe that there were any indicators that would have resulted in goodwill impairment charges as of   October 1, 2016  . The Company will, however, continue to assess the impact of significant events or circumstances on its recorded goodwill. 
  For further information related to the consolidation of an affiliate, see Note   5  , "  Long-Term Assets  ."

(  7  )   Debt    
  A summary of long-term debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and the related weighted average interest rates is shown below (in millions):   

   (1)      Unamortized portion 
  Senior Notes 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company s senior notes consist of   $500 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2023 at a stated coupon rate of   4.75%   (the "2023 Notes"),   $325 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2024 at a stated coupon rate of   5.375%   (the "2024 Notes") and   $650 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2025 at a stated coupon rate of   5.25%   (the "2025 Notes" and together with the 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, the "Notes"). 
  2023 Notes 
  The 2023 Notes were issued in January 2013 and mature on January 15, 2023. Interest is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year.  
  2024 Notes 
  The 2024 Notes were issued in March 2014 and mature on March 15, 2024. Interest is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year.  
  2025 Notes 
  The 2025 Notes were issued in November 2014 and mature on January 15, 2025. Interest is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Of the   $650 million   of proceeds from the offering, net of related issuance costs of   $8.4 million  ,   $250 million   was restricted for the redemption of the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's   8.125%   senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and   $350 million   was restricted to finance, in part, the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa (Note   1  , "  Basis of Presentation  "). 
  In January 2015, the Company used   $350 million   of the restricted cash proceeds from the offering, along with   $500 million   in borrowings under the Term Loan Facility (see "  Credit Agreement" below), to finance the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa. 
  In March 2015, the Company redeemed the 2020 Notes at a price equal to   104.063%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In connection with this transaction, the Company paid   $255.0 million  , including   $250 million   of the restricted cash proceeds from the offering, and recognized a loss of   $14.3 million   on the extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2015. The use of restricted cash for the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa and the redemption of the 2020 Notes is reflected as non-cash investing and financing activities, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 26, 2015  . The remaining proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the payment of fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa and related financing transactions.

  The components of the Company s net periodic other postretirement benefit cost are shown below (in millions):   

  In the   nine months ended     September 26, 2015  , the Company recognized pension benefit curtailment losses of   $7.7 million   related to its restructuring actions. 
  Contributions 
  Employer contributions to the Company s domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans in the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , were   $9.7 million  . The Company expects contributions to its domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans to be approximately   $10 million   to   $15 million   in   2016  . The Company may elect to make contributions in excess of minimum funding requirements in response to investment performance or changes in interest rates or when the Company believes that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on its other cash requirements. 
  Subsequent Event 
  In September 2016, the Company announced a limited lump-sum payout offer to certain terminated vested plan participants of its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. This offer provides participants with the flexibility to receive their pension benefits early and reduces the Company's future administrative costs and risks related to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Under this offer, eligible plan participants may voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits primarily in the form of a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of the participant s pension benefits. Eligible plan participants have from October 4, 2016 through November 10, 2016, to make their election. Payments under this offer will be distributed in December 2016 from existing defined benefit pension plan assets.  
  In connection with this offer, the Company expects to recognize a non-cash settlement charge in the fourth quarter of 2016. Although the actual amount of the charge and the related impact on the funded status of the affected U.S. defined benefit pension plans will depend on, among other factors, the number of plan participants accepting the offer, the Company currently estimates that the offer will result in a pretax non-cash settlement charge of approximately   $40 million   to   $55 million  .

(  9  )   Other (Income) Expense, Net    
  Other (income) expense, net includes non-income related taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments and hedging activities, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and other miscellaneous income and expense. 
  A summary of other (income) expense, net is shown below (in millions):   

  In the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , other expense includes net foreign currency transaction losses of   $3.6 million   and   $5.4 million  , respectively. In the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , other income includes a gain of   $30.3 million   related to the consolidation of an affiliate (Note   5  , "  Long-Term Assets  ").  
  In the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015  , other expense includes net foreign currency transaction losses of   $13.6 million   and   $27.9 million  , respectively. In the   nine months ended     September 26, 2015  , other expense includes a loss of   $14.3 million   related to the extinguishment of debt (Note   7  , "  Debt  "). 

(  10  )   Income Taxes    
  A summary of the provision for income taxes and the corresponding effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , is shown below (in millions, except effective tax rates):   

  In the first   nine months of     2016   and   2015  , the provision for income taxes was primarily impacted by the level and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. The provision was also impacted by a portion of the Company s restructuring charges and other expenses, for which no tax benefit was provided as the charges were incurred in certain countries for which no tax benefit is likely to be realized due to a history of operating losses in those countries. 
  In the first   nine months of     2016  , the Company recognized net tax benefits of   $14.5 million   related to restructuring charges and various other items. In addition, the Company recognized a gain of   $30.3 million   related to the consolidation of an affiliate, for which no tax expense was provided. In the first   nine months of     2015  , the Company recognized net tax benefits of   $32.0 million   related to restructuring charges, debt redemption costs, acquisition costs and various other items. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate in the first   nine months of     2016   and   2015   approximated the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   adjusted for income taxes on foreign earnings, losses and remittances, valuation allowances, tax credits, income tax incentives and other permanent items. 
  The Company s current and future provision for income taxes is impacted by the initial recognition of and changes in valuation allowances in certain countries. The Company intends to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company s future provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and, except for certain jurisdictions, no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowances are eliminated. Accordingly, income taxes are impacted by changes in valuation allowances and the mix of earnings among jurisdictions. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, the Company considers all available evidence in order to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets is necessary. Such evidence includes historical results, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and expectations for future taxable income (exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards), as well as the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. If,

  (Continued) 

based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company s deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. If operating results improve or decline on a continual basis in a particular jurisdiction, the Company s decision regarding the need for a valuation allowance could change, resulting in either the initial recognition or reversal of a valuation allowance in that jurisdiction, which could have a significant impact on income tax expense in the period recognized and subsequent periods.

(  11  )   Net Income Per Share Attributable to Lear    
  Basic net income per share attributable to Lear is computed by dividing net income attributable to Lear by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common shares issuable upon the satisfaction of certain conditions pursuant to a contractual agreement are considered common shares outstanding and are included in the computation of basic net income per share attributable to Lear. 
  Diluted net income per share attributable to Lear is computed using the treasury stock method by dividing net income attributable to Lear by the average number of common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the average share price during the period.

  Lear Corporation Stockholders  Equity 
  Common Stock Share Repurchase Program 
  In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a   $487.4 million   increase to the existing common stock share repurchase program to provide for a remaining aggregate repurchase authorization of   $1.0 billion  , while maintaining the program expiration date of December 31, 2017. In the first   nine months   of   2016  , the Company repurchased, in aggregate,   $557.7 million   of its outstanding common stock (  5,015,556   shares at an average purchase price of   $111.20   per share, excluding commissions).  As of the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, the Company has a remaining repurchase authorization of   $442.3 million   under its ongoing common stock share repurchase program. The Company may implement these share repurchases through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, open market purchases, accelerated stock repurchase programs and structured repurchase transactions. The extent to which the Company will repurchase its outstanding common stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon its financial condition, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

other factors. In addition, the Company s Credit Agreement places certain limitations on the Company s ability to repurchase its common stock. 
  Since the first quarter of 2011, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized   $3.4 billion   in share repurchases under its common stock share repurchase program. As of the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, the Company has repurchased, in aggregate,   $3.0 billion   of its outstanding common stock, at an average price of   $73.48   per share, excluding commissions and related fees, since the first quarter of 2011. 
  In addition to shares repurchased under the Company s common stock share repurchase program described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company classified shares withheld from the settlement of the Company s restricted stock unit and performance share awards to cover minimum tax withholding requirements as common stock held in treasury in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Quarterly Dividend  
  In the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , the Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of   $0.30   and   $0.25   per share of common stock, respectively. In the first   nine months   of   2016  , declared dividends totaled   $67.5 million  , and dividends paid totaled   $68.1 million  . In the first   nine months   of   2015  , declared dividends totaled   $59.9 million  , and dividends paid totaled   $60.0 million  . Dividends payable on common shares to be distributed under the Company s stock-based compensation program and common shares contemplated as part of the Company s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings will be paid when such common shares are distributed. 
  Noncontrolling Interests 
  In the first   nine months   of   2016  , the Company gained control of and consolidated an affiliate. For further information related to the consolidation, see Note   5  , "  Long-Term Assets  ." 
  In October 2016, the Company entered into a transaction to acquire the outstanding noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary, Shenyang Lear Automotive Seating and Interior Systems Co., Ltd., for   $33.0 million  . Upon completion of the transaction, the Company will own   100%   of the subsidiary. There will be no gain or loss recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a result of this transaction in the year ended December 31, 2016. 

(  13  )   Legal and Other Contingencies    
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had recorded reserves for pending legal disputes, including commercial disputes and other matters, of   $15.1 million   and   $9.2 million  , respectively. Such reserves reflect amounts recognized in accordance with GAAP and typically exclude the cost of legal representation. Product liability and warranty reserves are recorded separately from legal reserves, as described below. 
  Commercial Disputes 
  The Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with its customers, suppliers and competitors. These disputes vary in nature and are usually resolved by negotiations between the parties. 
  Product Liability and Warranty Matters 
  In the event that use of the Company s products results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, the Company may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims. Such lawsuits generally seek compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys  fees and costs. In addition, if any of the Company s products are, or are alleged to be, defective, the Company may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Certain of the Company s customers have asserted claims against the Company for costs related to recalls or other corrective actions involving its products. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.  
  To a lesser extent, the Company is a party to agreements with certain of its customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against the Company for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims.  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  
  LEAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Continued) 

In certain instances, allegedly defective products may be supplied by Tier 2 suppliers. The Company may seek recovery from its suppliers of materials or services included within the Company s products that are associated with product liability and warranty claims. The Company carries insurance for certain legal matters, including product liability claims, but such coverage may be limited. The Company does not maintain insurance for product warranty or recall matters. Future dispositions with respect to the Company s product liability claims that were subject to compromise under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings will be satisfied out of a common stock and warrant reserve established for that purpose. 
  The Company records product warranty reserves when liability is probable and related amounts are reasonably estimable. 
  A summary of the changes in reserves for product liability and warranty claims in the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , is shown below (in millions):    

  Environmental Matters 
  The Company is subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for clean-up costs resulting from past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance. The Company s policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on ISO 14001 to ensure compliance with this standard. However, the Company currently is, has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures. 
  The Company has been named as a potentially responsible party at several third-party landfill sites and is engaged in the cleanup of hazardous waste at certain sites owned, leased or operated by the Company, including several properties acquired in its 1999 acquisition of UT Automotive, Inc. ("UT Automotive"). Certain present and former properties of UT Automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant. The Company obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to certain environmental liabilities from United Technologies Corporation ("UTC") in connection with the Company s acquisition of UT Automotive. UTC manages and directly funds these environmental liabilities pursuant to its agreements and indemnities with the Company. 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had recorded environmental reserves of     $9.1 million  .     The Company does not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with its current and former properties will have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; however, no assurances can be given in this regard. 
  Other Matters 
  The Company is involved from time to time in various other legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, intellectual property matters, tax claims and employment matters. Although the outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any of the other legal proceedings or claims in which the Company is currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. 
  Although the Company records reserves for legal disputes, product liability and warranty claims and environmental and other matters in accordance with GAAP, the ultimate outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from current estimates.

(  14  )   Segment Reporting    
  The Company has   two   reportable operating segments:  seating, which includes complete seat systems and all major seat components, including seat covers and surface materials such as leather and fabric, seat structures and mechanisms, seat foam and headrests, and E-Systems (formerly electrical), which includes complete electrical distribution systems, electronic control modules and wireless communication modules. Key components in the electrical distribution system include wiring harnesses, terminals and connectors, junction boxes and high power components for hybrid and electric vehicles. The other category includes unallocated costs related to corporate headquarters, regional headquarters and the elimination of intercompany activities, none of which meets the requirements for being classified as an operating segment. 
  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based primarily on (i) revenues from external customers, (ii) pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates, interest expense and other (income) expense, ("segment earnings") and (iii) cash flows, being defined as segment earnings less capital expenditures plus depreciation and amortization. 
  A summary of revenues from external customers and other financial information by reportable operating segment is shown below (in millions):

In the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , segment earnings include restructuring charges of   $7.8 million  ,   $6.9 million   and   $0.2 million   in the seating and E-Systems segments and in the other category, respectively. In the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , segment earnings include restructuring charges of   $30.8 million  ,   $17.5 million   and   $2.9 million   in the seating and E-Systems segments and in the other category, respectively (Note   2  , "  Restructuring  "). 
  In the   three months ended     September 26, 2015  , segment earnings include restructuring charges of   $4.3 million  ,   $3.7 million   and   $6.9 million   in the seating and E-Systems segments and in the other category, respectively. In the   nine months ended     September 26, 2015  , segment earnings include restructuring charges of   $47.3 million  ,   $9.7 million   and   $14.7 million   in the seating and E-Systems segments and in the other category, respectively (Note   2  , "  Restructuring  ").

(  15  )   Financial Instruments    
  Debt Instruments 
  The carrying values of the Company s debt instruments vary from their fair values. The fair values were determined by reference to the quoted market prices of these securities (Level 2 input based on the GAAP fair value hierarchy). The estimated fair value, as well as the carrying value, of the Company's debt instruments are shown below (in millions):   

   (1)    Credit agreement and senior notes, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
  Accounts Receivable Factoring 
  One of the Company's European subsidiaries has an uncommitted factoring agreement, which provides for aggregate purchases of specified customer accounts of up to    200 million  . As of   October 1, 2016  , there were   no   factored receivables outstanding. The Company cannot provide any assurances that this factoring facility will be available or utilized in the future.  
  Marketable Equity Securities 
  Included in other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are   $28.8 million   and   $23.0 million  , respectively, of marketable equity securities, which the Company accounts for under the fair value option. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the marketable equity securities are recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income as a component of other expense, net. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1 input based on the GAAP fair value hierarchy). 
  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  The Company has used derivative financial instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other derivative contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and the resulting variability of the Company s operating results. The Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives. The Company s derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that provide for the net settlement of contracts, by counterparty, in the event of default or termination. On the date that a derivative contract for a hedging instrument is entered into, the Company  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

designates the derivative as either (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (a fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of the exposure of a forecasted transaction or of the variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge). 
  For a fair value hedge, both the effective and ineffective portions of the change in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings and reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedged transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition, for both cash flow and net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative that are excluded from the Company s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings and reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of income as other expense, net. 
  Foreign Exchange 
  The Company uses forwards, swaps and other derivative contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments are intended to offset gains and losses on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The principal currencies hedged by the Company include the Mexican peso, various European currencies, the Thai baht, the Japanese yen, the Philippine peso and the Canadian dollar. 
  The notional amount and estimated fair value of the Company's foreign currency derivative contracts are shown below (in millions, except for maturities):   

  Foreign currency derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments consist principally of hedges of cash transactions, intercompany loans and certain other balance sheet exposures.

  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss - Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , pretax net losses of approximately   $60.7 million   and   $46.4 million  , respectively, related to the Company s derivative instruments and hedging activities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the next twelve month period, the Company expects to reclassify into earnings net losses of approximately   $51.4 million   recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   October 1, 2016  . Such losses will be reclassified at the time that the underlying hedged transactions are realized. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , amounts recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to changes in the fair value of cash flow and fair value hedges excluded from the Company s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow and fair value hedges were not material.

Fair Value Measurements 
  GAAP provides that fair value is an exit price, defined as a market-based measurement that represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value measurements are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques:                   Market: 
      
    This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. 

Income  :  
      
    This approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on current market expectations. 

Cost: 
      
    This approach is based on the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). 

Further, GAAP prioritizes the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation techniques described above into a three-tier fair value hierarchy as follows:                   Level 1: 
      
    Observable inputs, such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 

Level 2: 
      
    Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability. 

Level 3: 
      
    Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the exit price of the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may be used if there is little or no market data for the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

The Company discloses fair value measurements and the related valuation techniques and fair value hierarchy level for its assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value. 
  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    
  Fair value measurements and the related valuation techniques and fair value hierarchy level for the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are shown below (in millions):   

The Company determines the fair value of its derivative contracts using quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value. The discount rates used are based on quoted bank deposit or swap interest rates. If a derivative contract is in a net liability position, the Company adjusts these discount rates by an estimate of the credit spread that would be applied by market participants purchasing these contracts from the Company s counterparties. If an estimate of the credit spread is required, the Company uses significant assumptions and factors other than quoted market rates, which would result in the classification of its derivative liabilities within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   derivative contracts that were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, there were   no   transfers in or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in   2016  .

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis    
  The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis, which are not included in the table above. As these non-recurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  As a result of the consolidation of Beijing BAI in 2016, Level 3 fair value estimates related to property, plant and equipment of   $20.7 million  , customer-based intangible assets of   $34.0 million   and noncontrolling interests of   $41.0 million   are recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   October 1, 2016  . In addition, the consolidation of Beijing BAI required a Level 3 fair value estimate related to the Company's previously held equity interest of   $63.0 million  . 
  As a result of the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa in 2015, Level 3 fair value estimates related to property, plant and equipment of   $142.4 million  , intangible assets of   $211.3 million   and contingent consideration of   $25.0 million   were recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
  Fair value estimates of property, plant and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. Fair value estimates of customer-based intangible assets were based on the present value of future earnings attributable to the asset group after recognition of required returns to other contributory assets. Fair value estimates of noncontrolling interests and the Company's previously held equity interest were based on the present value of future cash flows and a value to earnings multiple approach. In addition, these fair value estimates reflect discounts for the lack of control and the lack of marketability associated with the noncontrolling and previously held equity interests. Fair value estimates of the Eagle Ottawa contingent consideration were based on an income approach. 
  For further information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, see Note   5  ,    Long-Term Assets  .  For further information on the Eagle Ottawa fair value measurements, see Note 3,  Acquisition,  to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there were no additional significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

(  16  )   Accounting Pronouncements    
  The Company has considered the recent Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") summarized below, which could significantly impact its financial statements:                           Standards Pending Adoption 
      
    Description 
      
    Effective Date 
      
    Anticipated Impact 
      ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting    (1)  
      
    The standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees and includes provisions related to income taxes, the liability or equity classification of share-based payment awards and statement of cash flows presentation. The income tax related provisions of this update are expected to significantly impact the Company and must be adopted through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the update is adopted. 
      
    January 1, 2017 
      
    As of December 31, 2015, the Company had tax benefits related to share-based payment awards of $45.4 million, recorded as a reduction to long-term deferred tax assets, and $3.9 million, recorded in additional paid-in-capital. Adoption of this update would result in the elimination of such amounts from other long-term assets and additional paid-in-capital, with a corresponding $49.3 million increase to retained earnings. 
      ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers    (2)  
      
    The standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance and requires additional financial statement disclosures. The provisions of these updates may be applied through either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. 
      
    January 1, 2018 
      
    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these updates. 
      ASU 2016-02, Leases 
      
    The standard requires that a lessee recognize on its balance sheet right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities resulting from leasing transactions, as well as additional financial statement disclosures. Currently, U.S. GAAP only requires such balance sheet recognition for leases classified as capital leases. The provisions of this update apply to substantially all leased assets, with certain permitted exceptions, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. 
      
    January 1, 2019 
      
    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update. For additional information on the Company s operating lease commitments, see Note 11, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

ITEM 2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 
  We are a leading Tier 1 supplier to the global automotive industry. We supply seating, electrical distribution systems and electronic modules, as well as related sub-systems, components and software, to virtually every major automotive manufacturer in the world. 
  We use our product, design and technological expertise, global reach and competitive manufacturing footprint to achieve our financial goals and objectives of continuing to deliver profitable growth (balancing risks and returns), maintaining a strong balance sheet with investment grade credit metrics and consistently returning cash to our shareholders. 
  Our seating business consists of the design, development, engineering, just-in-time assembly and delivery of complete seat systems, as well as the design, development, engineering and manufacture of all major seat components, including seat covers and surface materials such as leather and fabric, seat structures and mechanisms, seat foam and headrests. Our E-Systems (formerly electrical) business consists of the design, development, engineering and manufacture of complete electrical distribution systems that route electrical signals and manage electrical power within a vehicle. Key components in the electrical distribution system include wiring harnesses, terminals and connectors, junction boxes and high power components for hybrid and electric vehicles. We also design, develop, engineer and manufacture sophisticated electronic control modules that facilitate signal, data and power management within the vehicle. We have added capabilities in wireless communication modules that process various signals to, from and within the vehicle, including cellular, WiFi, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and GPS.  
  We serve all of the world's major automotive manufacturers across both our seating and E-Systems businesses. It is common to have both seating and electrical content on the same and multiple vehicle platforms with a single customer. Our businesses benefit globally from leveraging common operating standards and disciplines, including world-class development and manufacturing processes, as well as common customer support and regional infrastructures. Our core capabilities are shared across component categories, including high-precision manufacturing and assembly with short lead times, management of complex supply chains, global engineering and program management skills and a unique customer-focused culture. Our businesses utilize proprietary, industry-specific processes and standards, leverage common low-cost engineering centers and share centralized operating support functions, such as logistics, supply chain management, quality and health and safety, as well as all major administrative functions.  
  Industry Overview 
  Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. Global automotive industry production volumes in the first   nine months   of   2016  , as compared to the first   nine months   of   2015  , are shown below (in millions of units):   

  Automotive sales and production can be affected by the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit, the availability of critical components needed to complete the production of vehicles, restructuring actions of our customers and suppliers, facility closures, changing consumer attitudes toward vehicle ownership and usage and other factors. Our operating results are also significantly impacted by the overall commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply particular products, as well as the profitability of the products that we supply for these platforms. The loss of business with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier, or a decrease in the production levels of any such models, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating results.

  LEAR CORPORATION 

In the first   nine months   of   2016  , our percentage of net sales by region is shown below:   

  Our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of business, and thereby maintain our financial performance in the future, will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis to reflect the market overall. 
  Key trends that specifically affect our business include automotive manufacturers' utilization of global vehicle platforms, a shift among many automotive manufacturers away from integrated systems to directed component sourcing, increasing demand for luxury and performance features and content in all vehicles and China's emergence as the single largest major automotive market in the world. In addition, three major mega-trends have broadly emerged as major drivers of change and growth in the automotive industry: connectivity, safety and efficiency.  
  Our strategy is built on addressing these trends and the major imperatives for success as an automotive supplier: quality, cost and efficiency, and innovation and technology. We have expanded key component and software capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions to ensure a full complement of the highest quality solutions for our customers. We have restructured, and continue to align, our manufacturing and engineering footprint to attain a leading competitive position globally. We have established or expanded activities in new and growing markets, especially China, in support of our customers  growth and global platform initiatives. These initiatives have helped us achieve our financial goals overall, as well as a more balanced regional, customer and vehicle segment diversification in our business.  
  Our customers typically require us to reduce our prices over the life of a vehicle model and, at the same time, assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Our financial performance is largely dependent on our ability to achieve product cost reductions through product design enhancement and supply chain management, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring actions. We also seek to enhance our financial performance by investing in product development, design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers and consumers. We continually evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business. 
  Our material cost as a percentage of net sales was 65.1% in the first   nine months   of   2016  , as compared to 66.7% in the first   nine months   of   2015  . Raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, such as the selective in-sourcing of components, the continued consolidation of our supply base, longer-term purchase commitments and the selective expansion of low-cost country sourcing and engineering, as well as value engineering and product benchmarking. However, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, the availability of raw materials, commodities and product components fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside of our control. If these costs increase or availability is restricted, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future. See "  Forward-Looking Statements" below and Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as supplemented and updated by Part II   Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2016. 
  Financial Measures 
  In evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus primarily on earnings, operating margins, cash flows and return on invested capital. In addition to maintaining and expanding our business with our existing customers in our more established markets, our expansion plans are focused primarily on emerging markets. Asia, in particular, continues to present significant growth opportunities, as major global automotive manufacturers implement production expansion plans and local automotive manufacturers aggressively expand their operations to meet increasing demand in this region. We currently have sixteen joint ventures with operations in Asia, as well as an additional joint venture in North America dedicated to serving Asian automotive manufacturers. We also have aggressively pursued this strategy by selectively increasing our vertical integration capabilities globally, as well as expanding our component manufacturing capacity in Asia, Brazil, Eastern Europe, Mexico and Northern Africa. Furthermore, we have expanded our low-cost engineering capabilities in India and the Philippines.

Our success in generating cash flow will depend, in part, on our ability to manage working capital effectively. Working capital can be significantly impacted by the timing of cash flows from sales and purchases. Historically, we generally have been successful in aligning our vendor payment terms with our customer payment terms. However, our ability to continue to do so may be impacted by adverse automotive industry conditions, changes to our customers  payment terms and the financial condition of our suppliers, as well as our financial condition. In addition, our cash flow is impacted by our ability to manage our inventory and capital spending effectively. We utilize return on invested capital as a measure of the efficiency with which our assets generate earnings. Improvements in our return on invested capital will depend on our ability to maintain an appropriate asset base for our business and to increase productivity and operating efficiency. 
  Operational Restructuring 
  In the first   nine months   of   2016  , we incurred pretax restructuring costs of approximately   $51 million   and related manufacturing inefficiency charges of approximately   $5 million  . Any future restructuring actions will depend upon market conditions, customer actions and other factors. 
  For further information, see Note   2  , "  Restructuring  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
  Share Repurchase Program and Quarterly Cash Dividends  
  Since the first quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors has authorized   $3.4 billion   in share repurchases under our common stock share repurchase program. In the first   nine months   of   2016  , we repurchased $558 million of shares and have a remaining repurchase authorization of   $442 million  , which will expire on December 31, 2017. 
  In the first, second and   third   quarters of   2016  , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.30   per share of common stock, reflecting a 20% increase over the quarterly cash dividend declared in   2015  . 
  For further information regarding our common stock share repurchase program and our quarterly dividends, see "  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Capitalization" and Note   12  , "  Comprehensive Income and Equity  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
  Other Matters 
  In June 2016, we amended the existing joint venture agreement of Beijing BAI Lear Automotive Systems Co., Ltd. ( Beijing BAI ) to eliminate the substantive participating rights of our joint venture partner. In conjunction with the consolidation of Beijing BAI and the valuation of our prior equity investment in Beijing BAI at fair value, we recognized a gain of approximately   $30 million   in the nine months ended October 1, 2016. 
  In September 2016, we announced a limited lump-sum payout offer to certain terminated vested plan participants of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For further information on this offer, see Note   8  ,    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  ,  to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
  In the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , we recognized net tax benefits of $2 million and   $15 million  , respectively, related to restructuring charges and various other items. 
  In January 2015, we completed the acquisition of Everett Smith Group Ltd. the parent of Eagle Ottawa, LLC ("Eagle Ottawa") for approximately $835 million. In conjunction with this acquisition, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $9 million related to advisory services in the   nine months   ended September 26, 2015. 
  In March 2015, we paid $255 million (which included $250 million of the net proceeds from the offering of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2025) to redeem the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a loss of approximately $14 million on the extinguishment of debt in the   nine months   ended September 26, 2015. 
  In the   three and nine months ended     September 26, 2015  , we recognized net tax benefits of $2 million and $32 million, respectively, related to restructuring charges, debt redemption costs, acquisition costs and various other items.

  Net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $4.5 billion  , as compared to   $4.3 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , an increase of   $196 million   or   5%  . New business in Asia, Europe and South America and higher production volumes on key Lear platforms in Asia and Europe positively impacted net sales by $209 million and $40 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by net foreign exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in emerging markets, which reduced net sales by $48 million. 

Cost of sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $4.0 billion  , as compared to   $3.9 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . New business in Asia, Europe and South America and higher production volumes on key Lear platforms in Asia and Europe resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $203 million. These increases were partially offset by net foreign exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in emerging markets, which reduced cost of sales by $38 million. 
  Gross profit and gross margin were   $514 million   and   11.4%   of net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $453 million   and   10.5%   of net sales in the   third   quarter of   2015  . New business and higher production volumes on key Lear platforms positively impacted gross profit by $40 million. The impact of favorable operating performance and the benefit of operational restructuring actions of $89 million more than offset the impact of selling price reductions and net foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $79 million. These factors had a corresponding impact on gross margin. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses, including engineering and development expenses, were   $154 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $138 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses was   3.4%   in the third quarter of   2016  , as compared to   3.2%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  Amortization of intangible assets was   $15 million   in the third quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $13 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  Interest expense was   $21 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  . 
  Other expense, net, which includes non-income related taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments and hedging activities, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and other miscellaneous income and expense, was   $14 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $22 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net foreign exchange losses decreased from $12 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $5 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the provision for income taxes was   $88 million  , representing an effective tax rate of   28.4%   on pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates of   $310 million  . In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the provision for income taxes was   $76 million  , representing an effective tax rate of   29.3%   on pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates of   $260 million  , for the reasons described below. 
  In the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , the provision for income taxes was impacted by the level and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. The provision was also impacted by a portion of our restructuring charges and other expenses, for which no tax benefit was provided as the charges were incurred in certain countries for which no tax benefit is likely to be realized due to a history of operating losses in those countries. In the   third   quarters of 2016 and   2015  , we recognized net tax benefits of $2 million related to restructuring charges and various other items. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   approximated the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   adjusted for income taxes on foreign earnings, losses and remittances, valuation allowances, tax credits, income tax incentives and other permanent items. 
  Equity in net income of affiliates was   $13 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $10 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , reflecting the improved operating performance of our equity affiliates primarily in China. 
  Net income attributable to Lear was   $214 million  , or   $2.98   per diluted share, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $181 million  , or   $2.34   per diluted share, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net income and diluted net income per share increased for the reasons described above. In addition, diluted net income per share was impacted by the decrease in average shares outstanding between periods.

Reportable Operating Segments 
  We have two reportable operating segments: seating, which includes complete seat systems and all major seat components, including seat covers and surface materials such as leather and fabric, seat structures and mechanisms, seat foam and headrests, and E-Systems, which includes complete electrical distribution systems, electronic control modules and wireless communication modules. Key components in the electrical distribution system include wiring harnesses, terminals and connectors, junction boxes and high power components for hybrid and electric vehicles. 
  The financial information presented below is for our two reportable operating segments and our other category for the periods presented. The other category includes unallocated costs related to corporate headquarters, regional headquarters and the elimination of intercompany activities, none of which meets the requirements for being classified as an operating segment. Corporate and regional headquarters costs include various support functions, such as information technology, corporate finance, legal, executive administration and human resources. Financial measures regarding each segment s pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates, interest expense and other expense ("segment earnings") and segment earnings divided by net sales ("margin") are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Segment earnings and the related margin are used by management to evaluate the performance of our reportable operating segments. Segment earnings should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to Lear, net cash provided by operating activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as measures of profitability or liquidity. In addition, segment earnings, as we determine it, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of consolidated segment earnings to consolidated income before provision for income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, see Note   14  , "  Segment Reporting  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, operational restructuring actions and debt service requirements. In addition, we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock share repurchase program. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under available credit facilities and our existing cash balance. A substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of and the combination of dividends, royalties, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances from our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our obligations. 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cash and cash equivalents of $928 million and $664 million, respectively, were held in foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated, primarily through the repayment of intercompany loans, without creating additional income tax expense. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Lear. For further information regarding potential dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, see "  Adequacy of Liquidity Sources," below, and Note 7, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Cash Flows 
  As summary of net cash provided by operating activities is shown below (in millions):   

  In the first   nine months of     2016  , increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of   $440 million  , a use of cash of   $87 million   and a source of cash of   $204 million  , respectively, primarily reflecting higher working capital to support the increase in our sales. In the first   nine months of     2016  , changes in accrued liabilities and other resulted in a source of cash of   $327 million  , primarily reflecting the timing of payment of accrued liabilities. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $249 million   in the first   nine months of     2016  , as compared to   $804 million   in the first   nine months of     2015  . This decrease was primarily due to cash paid of   $465 million   for the acquisition of Eagle Ottawa in 2015. Capital spending is estimated at     $525 million     for     2016  . 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $699 million   in the first   nine months of     2016  , as compared to   $21 million   in the first   nine months of     2015  .

As of   October 1, 2016  , there were no factored receivables outstanding. We cannot provide any assurances that this factoring facility will be available or utilized in the future.  
  Common Stock Share Repurchase Program 
  In February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a   $487 million   increase to our existing common stock share repurchase program to provide for a remaining aggregate repurchase authorization of   $1 billion  , while maintaining the program expiration date of December 31, 2017. In the first   nine months   of   2016  , we repurchased, in aggregate,   $558 million   of our outstanding common stock (  5,015,556   shares at an average purchase price of   $111.20   per share, excluding commissions). As of the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, we have a remaining repurchase authorization of   $442 million  .  
  We may implement these share repurchases through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, open market purchases, accelerated stock repurchase programs and structured repurchase transactions. The extent to which we will repurchase our outstanding common stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon our financial condition, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. In addition, our Credit Agreement places certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our common shares. See " Forward-Looking Statements." 
  Since the first quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors has authorized   $3.4 billion   in share repurchases under our common stock share repurchase program. As of the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, we have repurchased, in aggregate,   $3.0 billion   of our outstanding common stock, at an average price of   $73.48   per share, excluding commissions and related fees, since the first quarter of 2011. 
  For further information regarding our common stock share repurchase program, see Note   12  , "  Comprehensive Income and Equity  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

Dividends 
  The quarterly cash dividend declared in the first, second and third quarters of 2016 reflects a 20% increase over the quarterly cash dividend declared in the first, second and third quarters of   2015  . A summary of   2016   dividends is shown below: 

We currently expect to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, although such payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, alternative uses of capital and other factors that our Board of Directors may consider at its discretion. In addition, our Credit Agreement places certain limitations on the payment of cash dividends. 
  Adequacy of Liquidity Sources 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had approximately   $1.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents on hand and   $1.25 billion   in available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. Together with cash provided by operating activities, we believe that this will enable us to meet our liquidity needs to satisfy ordinary course business obligations. In addition, we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock, pursuant to our authorized common stock share repurchase program (see "  Common Stock Share Repurchase Program," above). Our future financial results and our ability to continue to meet our liquidity needs are subject to, and will be affected by, cash flows from operations, including the impact of restructuring activities, automotive industry conditions, the financial condition of our customers and suppliers and other related factors. Additionally, an economic downturn or reduction in production levels could negatively impact our financial condition. For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our cash flows from operations and our overall liquidity, see "  Executive Overview" above, "  Forward-Looking Statements" below and Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as supplemented and updated by Part II   Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2016. 
  Market Risk Sensitivity 
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We manage a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with our policies. We enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
  Foreign Exchange 
  Operating results may be impacted by our buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies ("transactional exposure"). We may mitigate a portion of this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange, futures and option contracts. The foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy. Gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are deferred where appropriate and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge. Gains and losses incurred related to foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions. 
  A summary of the notional amount and estimated aggregate fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts is shown below (in millions):

Currently, our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to various European currencies, the Mexican peso, the Thai baht, the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi and the Canadian dollar. We have performed a sensitivity analysis of our net transactional exposure, as shown below (in millions): 

(1)    Relative to all other currencies to which it is exposed for a twelve-month period 
  We have performed a sensitivity analysis related to the aggregate fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts, as shown below (in millions): 

(2)        Relative to all other currencies to which it is exposed for a twelve-month period 
  There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses above. The analyses assume that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar or Euro. In reality, some currencies may strengthen while others may weaken, causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement. 
  In addition to the transactional exposure described above, our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into U.S. dollars ("translational exposure"). In   2015  , net sales outside of the United States accounted for 77% of our consolidated net sales, although certain non-U.S. sales are U.S. dollar denominated. We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate our translational exposure.    
  Commodity Prices 
  Raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, such as the selective in-sourcing of components, the continued consolidation of our supply base, longer-term purchase commitments and the selective expansion of low-cost country sourcing and engineering, as well as value engineering and product benchmarking. However, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity cost environment. If these costs increase, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future. See "  Forward-Looking Statements" below and Item 1A, "Risk Factors   Increases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely affect our financial performance," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as supplemented and updated by Part II   Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2016. 
  We have commodity price risk with respect to purchases of certain raw materials, including steel, copper, diesel fuel, chemicals, resins and leather. Our main cost exposures relate to steel and copper. The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat structures and mechanisms and mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. Approximately 91% of our copper purchases are subject to price index agreements with our customers.

OTHER MATTERS 
  Legal and Environmental Matters 
  We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, commercial and contractual disputes, product liability claims and environmental and other matters. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had recorded reserves for pending legal disputes, including commercial disputes and other matters, of   $15 million  . In addition, as of   October 1, 2016  , we had recorded reserves for product liability claims and environmental matters of   $48 million   and   $9 million  , respectively. Although these reserves were determined in accordance with GAAP, the ultimate outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. For a description of risks related to various legal proceedings and claims, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as supplemented and updated by Part II   Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2016. For a more complete description of our outstanding material legal proceedings, see Note   13  , "  Legal and Other Contingencies  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
  Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. However, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, see Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates," and Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates during the   third   quarter of   2016  .

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
           (a) 
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
     The Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer along with the Company s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Based on the evaluation described above, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer along with the Company s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the desired control objectives were achieved as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
