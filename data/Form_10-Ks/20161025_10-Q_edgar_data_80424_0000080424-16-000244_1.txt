THE PROCTER   GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.  Basis of Presentation 
  These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  .  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter   Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company," "Procter   Gamble," "P G," "we" or "our") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.  However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 

2.  New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".  This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2018.  While we are currently assessing the impact of the new standard, we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance sheet by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current.  The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) .  The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2019.  We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.  The new guidance requires excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at vest or settlement over the benefits recognized at issuance of share based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at vest or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized at issuance of share based payments) to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.  The amended guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, rather than a financing activity.  The standard further provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than utilizing the estimated amount of forfeitures at the time of issuance.  The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our Income taxes on continuing operations rather than in Additional paid-in capital for fiscal year   2017  .  As a result, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of   $117   in Income taxes on continuing operations during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We also elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.  None of the other provisions in this amended guidance had a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

3.  Segment Information 
  As discussed in Note 11, the Beauty Brands and Batteries businesses are presented as discontinued operations and are excluded from segment results for all periods presented.  Effective July 1, 2016, the Company began accounting for sales to its Venezuela subsidiaries in Corporate for management reporting purposes.  As a result, we are also reflecting such sales in Corporate for segment reporting purposes.  This change is being made on a prospective basis for both management and external segment reporting purposes and did not have a significant impact on any of the segments.  
  
    Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

Following is a summary of reportable segment results: 

4.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: 

On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of   four   product categories, comprised of   41   of its beauty brands ("Beauty Brands"), to Coty, Inc.  The transaction includes the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color and cosmetics businesses and a majority of the fine fragrances business, along with select hair styling brands (see Note 11).  The Beauty Brands have historically been part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations.  As a result, the goodwill attributable to the Beauty Brands as of   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2016   is excluded from the preceding table and is reported as Current assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Goodwill increased from   June 30, 2016   primarily due to currency translation. 
  The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill.  The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination.  If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. 
  The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.  However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. 
  
    Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high.  While both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the Shave Care cushion, as well as the related indefinite-lived intangible assets, have been reduced to below   20%   due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar in recent years.  As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. 
  Identifiable intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   are comprised of: 

Due to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands, intangible assets specific to these businesses are reported as Current assets held for sale (see Note 11). 
  Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships.  The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands.  The amortization expense of intangible assets for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $89   and   $104  , respectively. 

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

5.  Earnings Per Share 
  Net earnings attributable to Procter   Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) are divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate Basic net earnings per common share.  Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated to give effect to stock options and other stock-based awards and assume conversion of preferred stock.  Net earnings attributable to Procter   Gamble and common shares used to calculate Basic and Diluted net earnings per share were as follows: 

(1)   
    Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.  Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. 
               (2)   
    Outstanding stock options of approximately   26 million   and   69 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). 
               (3)   
    Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings/(loss) attributable to Procter   Gamble. 

6.  Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits 
  The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs:  

(1)   
    The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for those interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  . 
     The disclosures above for both share-based compensation and postretirement benefits include amounts related to discontinued operations which were not material in any period presented. 
  
    Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

7.  Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements 
  As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.  The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.  Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: 

Investment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets.  The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was   $643   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $292   as of   June 30, 2016  .  The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was   $4,162   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $4,513   as of   June 30, 2016  .  The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was   $387   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $382   as of   June 30, 2016  .  The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was   $1,399   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1,018   as of   June 30, 2016  .  The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  There are no material investment balances classified as either Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. 
  The fair value of long-term debt was   $23,435   and   $24,362   as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively.  This includes the current portion (  $1,723   and   $2,761   as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively) of debt instruments.  Certain long-term debt is recorded at fair value.  Certain long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  Long-term debt with fair value of   $2,281   and   $2,331   as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  All remaining long-term debt is classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. 
  The following table sets forth the notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  : 

All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.  All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities.  The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the Company's derivative activity during the period.  The change in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments during the period reflects changes in the level of intercompany  
  
    Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

financing activity.  All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

    The gain or loss on the effective portion of cash flow hedging relationships is reclassified from AOCI into net income in the same period during which the related item affects earnings.  Such amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in Interest expense and foreign currency contracts in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG A) and Interest expense. 
               (2)   
    The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. 
               (3)   
    The gain or loss on foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in SG A.  This gain or loss substantially offsets the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. 

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

8.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) 
  The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component and the reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss): 

(1)   
    Net of tax expense/(benefit) of   $(68)  ,   $(4)   and   $9   for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively. 
               (2)   
    Net of tax expense/(benefit) of   $0  ,   $0   and   $35   for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively. 
               (3)   
    See Note 7 for classification of gains and losses from hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Gains and losses on investment securities are reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income/(loss), net.  Gains and losses on pension and other retiree benefits are reclassified from AOCI into Cost of products sold and SG A and are included in the computation of net periodic pension costs. 

9.  Restructuring Program 
  The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from   $250   to   $500   annually.  In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. 
  The Company expects to incur approximately   $5.5 billion   in before-tax restructuring costs over a six year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal   2017  ), including costs incurred as part of the ongoing and incremental restructuring program.  The program includes a non-manufacturing overhead enrollment reduction target of approximately   25%   -   30%   by the end of fiscal   2017  . 
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately   24%  .  The reductions are enabled by the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology and optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint.  In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. 
  Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  Through fiscal   2016  , the Company incurred charges of approximately   $4.9 billion  .  Approximately   $2.3 billion   of these charges were related to separations,   $1.4 billion   were asset-related costs and   $1.2 billion   were related to other restructuring-type costs. 
  For the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately   $168  .  Approximately   $21   of these charges were recorded in SG A and approximately   $129   of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold.  The remainder of the charges were included in discontinued operations.  The following table presents restructuring activity for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Separation Costs 
  Employee separation charges for the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2016   relate to severance packages for approximately   520   employees, including non-manufacturing employees of approximately   80  .  The packages are predominantly voluntary and the amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.  Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately   17,590   employees, of which approximately   9,620   are non-manufacturing overhead personnel. 
  Asset-Related Costs 
  Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. 
  Other Costs 
  Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes. 
  Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting.  Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.  However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: 

(1)   
    Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities and costs related to discontinued operations from our Beauty Brands businesses. 

10.  Commitments and Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and tax.  With respect to these and other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Income Tax Uncertainties 
  The Company is present in approximately   140   taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has   50       60   jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued liabilities of approximately   $200  , including interest and penalties. 
  Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 

11.  Discontinued Operations 
  On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of   four   product categories to Coty, Inc. ( Coty ).  The divestiture included   41   of the Company's beauty brands ( Beauty Brands ), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  The value of the transaction is estimated at approximately   $11.4 billion  .  The value is comprised of   105 million   shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for shares of the newly formed entity holding the Beauty Brands immediately prior to the close of the transaction, valued at approximately   $9.4 billion  , and the assumption of   $1.9 billion   of debt by the entity holding the Beauty Brands. 
  Subsequent to the initial contract signing and prior to the completion of the merger, two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce   Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture.  These brands have been subsequently divested at amounts that approximated their adjusted carrying values. 
  In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged Duracell, which the Company had infused with approximately   $1.9 billion   of additional cash, to repurchase all   52.5 million   shares of P G stock owned by BH.  During fiscal 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash, before-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charge of   $402   (  $350   after-tax), to reduce the value to the total estimated proceeds based on the value of BH s shares in P G stock at the time of the impairment charges.  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of   $422   to reflect the final value of the BH s shares in P G stock.  The total value of the transaction was   $4.2 billion   representing the value of the Duracell business and the cash infusion.  The cash infusion was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock. 
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands and Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.  Additionally, the Beauty Brands' balance sheet positions are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  The Batteries business was historically part of the Company's Fabric   Home Care reportable segment.   

On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2014-08, which included new reporting and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.  The new requirements are effective for discontinued operations occurring on or after the adoption date, which includes the Beauty Brands divestiture.  All other discontinued operations prior to July 1, 2015 are reported based on the previous disclosure requirements for discontinued operations, including the Batteries divestiture.

  The following is selected financial information related to cash flows from discontinued operations for the Beauty Brands:   

Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 

The major components of assets and liabilities of the Beauty Brands held for sale are provided below.  

Prior to the transaction, Beauty Brands drew   $1.9 billion   of debt (  $1.0 billion   as of   June 30, 2016  ), which as noted above, was used to fund a portion of the transaction. The proceeds were held by the Beauty Brands as of   June 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016   the funds are held by the Company and are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Restricted cash until the anticipated legal closing activities are completed.  Subsequent to closing, this cash will be used to retire P G debt as part of a broader debt retirement program that was announced subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included in the section titled "Economic Conditions and Uncertainties" and the section titled  Risk Factors  (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). 
  The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD A) is to provide an understanding of Procter   Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year.  The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  The MD A is organized in the following sections: 
             
    Overview 
                 
    Economic Conditions and Uncertainties 
                  
    Liquidity and Capital Resources 
                
    Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP 
     Throughout the MD A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings.  We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity.  Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends.  Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending.  Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings.  We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management.  The explanation at the end of the MD A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. 
  Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information.  References to market share and market consumption in the MD A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates.  All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category.

     The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): 

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
  Following are highlights of results for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  : 
             
    Net sales were unchanged versus the previous year at $16.5 billion.  Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 3%.  Organic sales increased 3% in Beauty and in Grooming, 7% in Health Care, 4% in Fabric   Home Care and 2% in Baby, Feminine   Family Care. 
                
    Unit volume increased 2% with organic volume up 3%.  Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and low single digits in Fabric   Home Care and in Baby, Feminine   Family Care. Volume was unchanged in Grooming and decreased low single digits in Beauty.  Excluding the impacts of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in both Beauty and Grooming. 
                
    Net earnings from continuing operations were   $2.9 billion  , an increase of   $98 million  , or   4%   versus the prior year period.  This increase was driven by an increase in other non-operating income due to minor brand divestitures and a lower effective tax rate. 
                
    Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased   4%   to   $1.00  . 
                
    Net earnings attributable to Procter   Gamble were   $2.7 billion  , an increase of   $113 million  , or   4%   versus the prior year period, driven by the increase in net earnings from continuing operations.  
                
    Core net earnings per share, which excludes discontinued operations and incremental restructuring charges, increased 5% to $1.03. 
                
    Operating cash flow was   $3.0 billion  .  Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was   $2.3 billion  .  Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was   85%  . 
     ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
  Global Economic Conditions.      Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. 
  Changes in Costs.    Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts.  We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs.  If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. 
  Foreign Exchange.    We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Over the past four years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Mexico, and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales. 
  Government Policies.    Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies.  For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings.  Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Egypt, Nigeria and Ukraine.  Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.  For example, during fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. 
  For information on risk factors that could impact our results, refer to Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016 
  The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

Net Sales 
  Net sales were unchanged at   $16.5 billion   for the first quarter.  Unit volume increased 2%.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%.  Pricing and mix had no net impact on consolidated net sales.  Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and low single digits in Fabric   Home Care and in Baby, Feminine   Family Care.  Volume was unchanged in Grooming and decreased low single digits in Beauty driven by minor brand divestitures.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.  Organic sales increased 3% driven by a 3% increase in organic volume. 

*  Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. 
  **  Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions/divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. 
  Operating Costs 
  Gross margin increased   30   basis points to   51.0%   of net sales for the quarter.  Gross margin increased primarily due to a 190 basis point positive impact from manufacturing cost savings and a 20 basis point benefit from volume scale leverage.  These impacts were partially offset by an 80 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 20 basis point decrease due to incremental restructuring charges, a 30 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix across segments (caused by net sales declines in Beauty and in Grooming, which have higher than company-average gross margins), and 50 basis points of combined impact from higher commodity costs and initiative investments. 
  Total SG A spending increased 1% to $4.6 billion due to increased marketing activities partially offset by lower overhead spending due to productivity efforts.  SG A as a percentage of net sales increased   20   basis points to   28.1%  .  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to an increase in advertising and other activities.  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points, as 60 basis points of productivity savings in overhead spending was partially offset by wage inflation and foreign exchange.   
  Non-Operating Expenses and Income 
  Interest expense was   $131 million   for the quarter, a decrease of   $9 million   versus the prior year period, due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates.  Interest income was   $35 million   for the quarter, a decrease of   $9 million   versus the prior year period due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Other non-operating income/(loss) was   $63 million  , an increase of   $81 million  , due to gains from minor brand divestitures. 
  Income Taxes on Continuing Operations 
  The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 90 basis points to 23.1% primarily due to a 310 basis point impact following the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees.  This was partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix of earnings and the impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 30 basis points in the current year versus 60 basis points in the prior year).  
  Net Earnings from Continuing Operations 
  Net earnings from continuing operations increased   $98 million   or   4%   for the quarter.  This increase was due to the increase in non-operating income and decrease in the effective income tax rate discussed above.  Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $200 million for the quarter due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the currencies of Argentina, Mexico, Egypt and the United Kingdom.  This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased   4%   to   $1.00   due to increased net earnings. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  The net loss from discontinued operations improved by $24 million to   $118 million   in the current period versus a net loss of   $142 million   in the prior period.  This change was driven primarily by a base period loss on the Batteries business (as impairment charges more than offset earnings), partially offset by current period Beauty Brands transition costs (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
  Net Earnings 
  Net earnings attributable to Procter   Gamble increased   $113 million   or   4%   to   $2.7 billion   for the quarter.  The increase was due to the improvements in net earnings from both continuing and discontinued operations, both discussed above.  Diluted net earnings per share increased   5%   to   $0.96  .  Core net earnings per share increased   5%   to   $1.03  .  Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans. 
   
  BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION     Three   Months Ended   September 30, 2016 
  The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment.  Analyses of the results for the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2016   are provided based on a comparison to the same   three   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations.  The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): 

Beauty 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with three     months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Beauty net sales decreased   1%   to   $3.0 billion   during the   first fiscal quarter   on a 2% decrease in unit volume.    Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Price increases contributed 1% to net sales.  Favorable product mix added 1% to net sales primarily due to growth of the super-premium SK-II brand which has higher than average selling prices.  Organic sales increased 3% on organic volume that increased 2%.  Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.7 points.  Volume decreased low single digits in both developed and developing markets.  Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in developing markets.    
             
    Volume in Hair Care was down low single digits due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume increased low single digits.  Developed markets declined low single digits due to competitive activity and developing markets declined low single digits due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume increased low single digits in developing markets behind market growth and increased marketing.  Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased nearly a point.    
                
    Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased low single digits.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions due to product innovation and increased promotional activity.  Volume decreased low single digits in developing regions due to minor brand divestitures, with organic volume up low single digits behind innovation and increased marketing.  Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased half a point.    
     Net earnings decreased   5%   to   $592 million     due to the reduction in net sales, along with an 80 basis point decrease in net earnings margin.  The net earnings margin declined due to an increase in SG A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by increase in gross margin.  SG A as a percentage of net sales increased due to increases in both marketing and overhead spending.  Gross margin increased primarily due to increased pricing and productivity savings, which were only partially offset by unfavorable commodity and foreign exchange impacts.      

Grooming 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with three     months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Grooming net sales decreased   1%   to   $1.7 billion   during the   first fiscal quarter     on unit volume that was unchanged.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%.  Price increases in Shave Care contributed 1% to net sales.  Organic sales increased 3% on a 3% increase in organic volume.  Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.1 point.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.    
             
    Shave Care volume was unchanged in both developed and developing regions as increased marketing support and product innovation were largely offset by competitive activity.  Organic volume increased mid-single digits in developing regions.  Global market share of the blades and razors category increased slightly.    
                
    Volume in Appliances increased low single digits.  Volume was up mid-single digits in developed regions and low single digits in developing regions due to product innovation and market growth.  Global market share of the Appliances category decreased a point.    
     Net earnings increased   6%   to   $415 million     as a 170 basis-point increase in net earnings margin was only partially offset by the reduction in net sales.  Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin driven by the benefits of increased pricing and productivity efforts, which were only partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and other investments.  Gross margin expansion was partially offset by an increase in SG A as a percent of net sales due to increased marketing spending.    
  Health Care 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with three     months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Health Care net sales increased   4%   to   $1.9 billion   during the   first fiscal quarter     on a 5% increase in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%.  Price increases in both Oral Care and Personal Health Care contributed 1% to net sales and favorable product mix added 1% to net sales primarily due to an increase in Oral care product forms with higher than average selling prices.  Organic sales increased 7% on a 5% increase in organic volume.  Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.3 points.  Volume increased mid-single digits in both developed and developing regions.    
             
    Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits in developed regions and low single digits in developing regions driven by market growth and product innovation. Global market share of the Oral Care category decreased slightly.      
                
    Volume in Personal Health Care increased high single digits with low single-digit growth in developed regions and double-digit growth in developing regions behind market growth, product innovation and expanded distribution.  Global market share of the Personal Health Care category decreased nearly half a point.     
     Net earnings increased   1%   to   $320 million   primarily due to the increase in net sales partially offset by a 50 basis point reduction in net earnings margin.  Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable sales channel mix and foreign exchange impacts.  This was more than offset by an increase in SG A as a percentage of net sales due to a base period benefit related to the earnings of our PGT Healthcare partnership.      
  Fabric   Home Care 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Fabric   Home Care net sales increased   1%   to   $5.3 billion   for the   first fiscal quarter     on a 2% increase in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Favorable geographic mix added 1% to net sales due to the growth of developed regions which have higher than segment-average selling prices.  Lower pricing driven by promotional spending had a negative 1% impact on net sales.  Organic sales increased 4% on a 4% increase in organic volume.  Global market share of the Fabric   Home Care segment was unchanged.  Volume increased mid-single digits in developed regions and was down low single digits in developing regions.      
             
    Fabric Care volume increased low single digits as a mid-single-digit increase in developed markets due to innovation and increased marketing spending were partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in developing regions driven by competitive activity and reduced distribution of less profitable brands.  Global market share of the Fabric Care category was unchanged.    
                
    Home Care volume increased low single digits driven by a mid-single-digit increase in developed markets due to product innovation, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in developing regions due to minor brand divestitures.  Organic volume in developing regions increased low single digits due to product innovation.  Global market share of the Home Care category was up slightly.      
     Net earnings decreased   3%   to   $728 million     due to a 50 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin, which more than offset the increase in net sales.  Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a higher tax rate.  Gross margin expansion was largely offset by increased SG A as a percent of net sales.  Increased gross margin was driven by manufacturing cost savings and favorable geographic and product mix, driven by increases in developed markets and in premium product forms, both of which have higher than segment-average margins, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, lower pricing and other investments.  SG A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to increased marketing and overhead spending.  The tax rate increased due in part to disproportionate growth in the U.S., which has higher than global-average tax rates.     

Baby, Feminine   Family Care 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with three     months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Baby, Feminine   Family Care net sales decreased   1%   to   $4.6 billion   during the   first fiscal quarter   o  n a 3% increase in unit volume.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%.  Unfavorable geographic mix reduced net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of developing regions which have lower than segment-average selling prices.  Lower pricing driven by promotional spending had a negative 1% impact on net sales.  Organic sales increased 2% on a 4% increase in organic volume.  Global market share of the Baby, Feminine   Family Care segment decreased 0.5 points.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and increased mid-single digits in developing regions.    
             
    Volume in Baby Care increased low single digits caused by a high single-digit increase in developing regions due to market growth and decreased pricing.  Volume decreased low single digits in developed regions due to competitive activity.  Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased less than half a point.    
                
    Volume in Feminine Care increased low single digits due to a mid-single-digit increase in developed regions and a low single-digit increase in developing regions, both due to product innovation and market growth.  Global market share of the Feminine Care category decreased nearly half a point.    
                
    Volume in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased mid-single digits driven by market growth, product innovation and increased merchandising.  In the U.S., all-outlet share of the Family Care category was up less than half a point.    
     Net earnings decreased   7%   to   $697 million     due to the decline in net sales and a 90 basis point reduction in the net earnings margin.  Net earnings margin declined due to an increase in SG A as a percent of sales driven by higher marketing and overhead spending, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.  Gross margin increased slightly due to manufacturing cost savings and lower commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and other investments.     
  Corporate 
  Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments.  These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; certain significant asset impairment charges; and certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.    
  Corporate net sales decreased 1% to $  106 million   during the   first fiscal quarter  .  Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by $174 million to $  123 million   in the   first fiscal quarter     due mainly to a reduction in unallocated  corporate overhead spending, due in part to the elimination of stranded overheads from divestitures, and tax benefits resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees.  Additional discussion of this item is included in the Results of Operations section.    
  Productivity and Cost Savings Plan 
  In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. 
  As part of this plan, which has been expanded since its inception, the Company expects to incur approximately   $5.5 billion   in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017).  Approximately   91%   of the estimated costs have been incurred through   September 2016  .  Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment.  Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately   $3 billion   in annual gross savings (before-tax).  The cumulative before-tax savings as of the current year are estimated at approximately   $2.5   to   $3   billion.  Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. 
  Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. 

LIQUIDITY   CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Operating Activities 
  We generated   $3.0 billion   of cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of   $513 million   versus the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, and gain on sale of businesses), generated $3.3 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts used $252 million of cash in the period.  Accounts receivable used $424 million of cash in part due to an increase in sales versus the final quarter of fiscal 2016.  Inventory consumed $287 million of cash due to initiatives and production seasonality to support holiday shipments.  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $298 million of cash primarily due to an increase in taxes payable due to the timing of estimated payments.  All other operating assets and liabilities generated $135 million of cash. 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash used by investing activities was   $2.1 billion   in the quarter.  Capital expenditures were $684 million, or 4.1% of net sales.  We generated $183 million of cash from proceeds from asset sales primarily from plant asset sales and minor brand divestitures.  The pending sale of the Beauty Brands used cash of $1.2 billion, including $348 million of cash transferred to the Beauty business and accounted for in Current assets held for sale and $874 million of borrowings related to the Beauty Brands that were placed in Restricted cash to be used in connection with the sale of the Beauty Brands.  We used $631 million for purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by cash generated from proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments. 
  Financing Activities 
  Our financing activities consumed net cash of   $507 million   in the quarter.  We used $1.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $1.9 billion for dividends.  Cash generated from net debt issuances was $1.4 billion.  Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $937 million of cash. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $2.8 billion.  Excluding assets and liabilities of the Beauty businesses held for sale, current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.2 billion.  We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. 
  RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP 
  In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by Management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. 
  The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following item: 
  Incremental restructuring  :  The Company has and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax.  Beginning in 2012 Procter   Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities.  This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings.  The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.     
  We do not view the above item to be part of our sustainable results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.    
  Organic sales growth  :  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.    
  Free cash flow  :  Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending.  Free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  Management views free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment.    
  Free cash flow productivity  :  Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings.  Management views free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P G s ability to generate cash.  Free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.    
  Core EPS  :  Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated.  Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.  
  Organic sales growth  : 

*  Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes the mix impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. 
  Free cash flow and free cash flow productivity (dollar amounts in millions)  : 

* Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter   Gamble.

 FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE TRANS AGREEMENT AMONG P&G, COTY, GALLERIA AND GREEN ACQ

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 2-1 

Fourth Amendment to Transaction Agreement 

FOURTH AMENDMENT TO 
  TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 
    
  This Fourth Amendment to the Transaction Agreement (this    Amendment   ), dated August 25, 2016, is by and among The Procter   Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation (   Parent   ), Galleria Co., a Delaware corporation (   SplitCo   ), Coty Inc., a Delaware corporation (   Acquiror   ), and Green Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (   Merger Sub   ), and amends that certain Transaction Agreement, dated July 8, 2015 and amended August 13, 2015, February 19, 2016 and May 25, 2016, by and among Parent, SplitCo, Acquiror and Merger Sub (the    Agreement   ) and certain deliveries to be made thereunder, all as contemplated by   Section 10.06   of the Agreement.  The capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 
  ARTICLE I 
  AMENDMENTS 
  Section 1.1      Accounts Receivable  . 
           a. 
    Section 1.05(a)(xvii)   of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:  
       
   (xvii)    all accounts receivable that are either (A) primarily related to the Galleria Business and held by SplitCo or any Galleria Entity or (B) primarily related to the Salon Professional Business or the Mercury Business, including (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement) all accounts receivable primarily related to the Dolce   Gabbana Business or the Christina Aguilera Business, other than accounts receivable primarily related to the Mercury Business in Russia.

    Paragraph 4(b)(i) of   Schedule 1.05(a)(xiii)   of the Parent Disclosure Letter is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
       
   (A)    In the case of an Unfunded DB Plan,    DB Actuarial Liabilities    means the estimated Liabilities, as of the Closing Date, attributable to Pension Employees under the Unfunded DB Plans, calculated on the basis of the accumulated benefit obligation based on GAAP ASC 715 and using Parent s most recent actuarial assumptions incorporated into Parent s annual financial reports.  The DB Actuarial Liabilities will be estimated approximately 90 calendar days prior to the Closing Date. 
  (B)    Within 60 calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to Acquiror a statement setting forth a detailed calculation and breakdown prepared by a qualified actuary selected by Parent (   Parent s Actuary   ) of the DB Actuarial Liabilities for the Unfunded DB Plans.  Unless Acquiror notifies Parent of an objection to the determination by Parent s Actuary of the DB Actuarial Liabilities within 10 calendar days following Parent s delivery of the determination by Parent s Actuary of the DB Actuarial Liabilities, such amount will become final and binding on Parent, Acquiror and their respective Affiliates and will be the    Final DB Actuarial Liabilities  .   Any notice of objection from Acquiror must specify in reasonable detail the nature of any objection, and may only be based on the good faith belief by a qualified actuary selected by Acquiror (   Acquiror s Actuary   ) that Parent s Actuary has used unreasonable actuarial assumptions or otherwise made an actuarial error.  In the event Acquiror provides such a notice of objection, Parent s Actuary and Acquiror s Actuary will discuss the calculation of the DB Actuarial Liabilities in good faith and seek to reach an agreement during the 10-calendar day period following Parent s receipt of such notice of     objection.  If such actuaries are able to reach agreement, then they will reduce such agreement to writing and such agreement will become final and binding on Parent, Acquiror and their respective Affiliates and will be the    Final DB Actuarial Liabilities  .   If such actuaries are unable to reach an agreement within such 10-calendar day period, they will jointly select and retain a third actuary within 10 Business Days following such 10-calendar day period, which third actuary will make the appropriate calculations in respect of the DB Actuarial Liabilities within 20 calendar days after its selection, and such amount will be final and binding on Parent, Acquiror and their respective Affiliates and will be the    Final DB Actuarial Liabilities  .   Parent and Acquiror will share equally the cost of any such third actuary. 
  (C)    Any transfers required pursuant to Paragraph 4(a)(ii)(A) with respect to Unfunded DB Plans will be completed on or prior to the Closing Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Assets will be transferred pursuant to this   Schedule 1.05(a)(xiii)   of the Parent Disclosure Letter or   Section 6.03(b)   of the Agreement with respect to any Liabilities attributable to Pension Employees under the Galleria Business Acquired Plans that are reflected in the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement.

You further understand and agree that, unless you have prior written consent from P G, you will not engage in any activity or provide any services for a period of three (3) years following your Last Day of Employment in connection with the manufacture, development, advertising, promotion or sale of any product which is the same as, similar to, or competitive with any products of P G or its subsidiaries (including both existing products as well as products in development which are known to you, as a consequence of your employment with P G): 
        
    1.     With respect to which your work has been directly concerned at any time during the two (2) years preceding your Last Day of Employment; or 
        
    2.     With respect to which during that period of time you, as a consequence of your job performance and duties, acquired knowledge of trade secrets or other confidential information of P G. 
        
    For the purposes of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed that you have knowledge or information to which you were directly exposed through the actual receipt of memos or documents containing such information or through actual attendance at meetings at which such information was discussed or disclosed. The provisions of this section are not in lieu of, but are in addition to, your continuing obligation to not use or disclose P G s trade secrets and confidential information known to you until any particular trade secret or confidential information becomes generally known (through no fault of yours). Information regarding products in development, in test market or being marketed or promoted in a discrete geographic region, which information P G is considering for a broader use, shall not be deemed generally known until such broader use is actually commercially implemented. Also,  generally known  means known throughout the domestic United States industry or, if you have job responsibilities outside of the United States, the appropriate foreign country or countries  industry. 
  If any restriction in this section is found by any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it will be modified and interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area so that it may be enforceable.  
  As a participant in the 2009 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 1992 Stock Plan, you are also bound by the terms of Article F - Restrictions   Covenants of those plans, which are incorporated herein by reference.

      Non-Solicitation: 
    
    You acknowledge, as a participant in the Procter   Gamble 2014 Stock   Incentive Compensation Plan, the Procter   Gamble 2009 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, the Procter   Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive Plan, the Procter   Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, and/or the Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan that you are bound to comply with the Plans  non-solicitation obligations.

Return of P G Property: 
    You agree that on or before your Last Day of Employment, you will return to P G in good condition all of its equipment, materials and information that were in your possession, custody or control (including, but not limited to, computers, files, documents, credit cards, keys and identification badges). You further agree that you will provide your manager with all passwords to P G electronic communication and data systems before your Last Day of Employment. You further agree that on or before your Last Day of Employment, you will return or if directed to do so by your immediate manager, delete (i.e., destroy all copies of) any and all P G confidential, proprietary or trade secret information you have maintained in your possession, custody, or control in paper, electronic and/or digital formats, including but not limited to, any such confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information (e.g., files, documents, etc.) that you may have electronically or digitally processed or stored on P G-issued or on personally-owned or maintained digital devices and/or service accounts. Such digital devices and/or service accounts may include, but are not limited to desktop and laptop computers, notebooks, tablets, iPads, mobile phones, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), USB and flash drives, external hard drives, CDs, DVDs, and/or external file processing or storage provided by cloud service providers such as box.net, dropbox, Google docs, etc. 
      Ethics Compliance: 
    
    You agree that you provided P G all information known to you regarding any violations of the Procter   Gamble Worldwide Business Conduct Manual and/or any other violations of P G policy or the law. 
    
      Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes: 
    
    Resolving any future differences we may have in the courts can take a long time and be expensive. You and P G therefore agree that the only remedy for all disputes that are not released by this Agreement or that arise out of your employment with or separation from P G, or any aspect of this Agreement, will be to submit any such disputes (with the exception noted at the end of this section) to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the National Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. 

You and P G agree that the aggrieved party must send written notice of any claim to the other party by certified mail, return receipt requested. Written notice for P G will be sent to: Secretary, One Procter   Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45202, and to you at the most current address shown for you in P G s records. The arbitrator will apply Ohio law. At your written request, P G will reimburse you for all fees and costs charged by the American Arbitration Association and its arbitrator to the extent they exceed the applicable fees and costs that would have been charged by a court of competent jurisdiction had your claim been filed in court. 

There is one exception to this section. P G may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction if it has reason to believe that you have violated or are about to violate (1) the terms of the  Confidential, Proprietary, Trade Secret Information   Period of Non-Competition  section above, or (2) if you are a participant in the 2009 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 1992 Stock Plan, the terms of Article F - Restrictions   Covenants of those plans or (3) if you are a participant in the 2014 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, the terms of Article 6 - Restrictions   Covenants of those plans. 
    
      Severability: 
    
    If any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator should later find that any portion of this Agreement is invalid, that invalidity will not affect the enforceability of any other portion of this Agreement.   
    
      Employment References: 
    
    You understand that P G s historical policy is to not provide employment references to prospective employers. However, P G is willing to waive that policy in your case on the following basis: You authorize your manager or human resources representative to provide an employment reference upon written or verbal request. In return, you release any claim against P G and will not bring a lawsuit in court against P G based upon that employment reference (or lack thereof). You agree that you will refer all reference inquiries to your manager or human resources representative only. You further understand that all disputes regarding employment references or the lack thereof must be resolved through the arbitration process described above. 

No Reliance: 
    This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and P G and fully supersedes any prior agreements or understanding between the parties except that if you are a participant in the 2009 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 1992 Stock Plan, the terms of Article F - Restrictions   Covenants of those plans remain in full force and effect and are incorporated herein by reference and if you are a participant in the 2014 Stock Plan, the terms of Article 6 - Restrictions   Covenants of the plan remain in full force and are in effect and are incorporated herein by reference.  In deciding to accept this Agreement, you agree that you have not relied upon any statements or promises by P G, its managers, agents or employees, other than those set forth in this Agreement. No other promises or agreements concerning the matters described 
  in this Agreement shall be binding unless in a subsequent document signed by these parties. 
    
      Your Attorney: 
    
    You acknowledge that you have been and hereby are advised to consult with legal counsel before accepting this Agreement and have either done so or have voluntarily declined to do so. 
    
      Timing for Acceptance or Revocation: 
    
    You have forty-five (45) calendar days in which to consider this Agreement in which you waive important rights, including those under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. If you choose to sign this Agreement, please do so by indicating your acceptance of this Agreement with your electronic signature in P G s electronic system. We advise you to consult with an attorney of your choosing prior to signing this Agreement. Further, you may within seven (7) calendar days following the date you sign this Agreement, cancel and terminate it by giving written notice of your intention to revoke the Agreement to your immediate manager, and by returning to P G any remuneration or benefits that have been advanced to you in anticipation of your not revoking your agreement and to which you are not entitled. If notice of your revocation is mailed, it must be postmarked within seven (7) calendar days after you sign this Agreement. 
  You agree that any modifications, material or otherwise, made to this Agreement, do not restart or affect in any manner the original up to forty-five (45) calendar day consideration period. 

The benefits described in this Agreement and pursuant to the summary plan description for the Procter   Gamble Basic Separation Program for U.S. Employees, are the special benefits you will receive by signing this Agreement.  To the extent this Agreement describes benefits under other benefit plans and policies sponsored by P G, these special benefits are also described in the summary plan descriptions for those plans.  As such, nothing in this Agreement amends or changes the terms of any P G-sponsored employee benefit plan or policy.  

After your Last Day of Employment, you will no longer be an active P G employee, which may affect your coverage under those plans and policies.  For example, plans may require that you enroll in Medicare to be eligible for coverage.  For more information on how not being an active P G employee may affect your coverage, please refer to and review the summary plan descriptions for each plan, available at PGOne -  Life and Career.

  Responsibility for Taxes 
  Regardless of any action P G     takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ( Tax-Related Items ), I acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains my responsibility and that P G (1) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this Award, including the issuance,  vesting or exercise, settlement, the subsequent sale of shares acquired, the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents or the potential impact of current or future tax legislation in any jurisdiction; and (2) does not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate my liability for Tax-Related Items. 
    
  Prior to exercise or settlement of an Award, I shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to P G to satisfy all withholding and payment on account obligations of P G.  In this regard, I authorize P G to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items from my wages or other cash compensation paid to me by P G or from proceeds of the sale of the shares.  Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, P G may (1) sell or arrange for the sale of shares that I acquire to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (2) withhold in shares, provided that P G only withholds the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount.  Finally, I shall pay to P G any amount of Tax-Related Items that P G may be required to withhold as a result of my participation in the Plan or my purchase of shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  P G may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the shares if I fail to comply with my obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.

  Voting Rights and Dividend Equivalents 
  As a holder of RSUs, during the period from the Grant Date until the date the RSUs are paid, each time a cash dividend or other cash distribution is paid with respect to Common Stock, you will receive additional RSUs ( Dividend Equivalent RSUs ).  The number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be determined as follows:  multiply the number of RSUs and Dividend Equivalent RSUs currently held by the per share amount of the cash dividend or other cash distribution on Common Stock, then divide the result by the price of the Common Stock on the date of the dividend or distribution.  These Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original RSUs that gave rise to them, including vesting and settlement terms, except that if there is a fractional number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs on the date the RSUs are paid, the Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be rounded up to the nearest whole number of RSUs.  This Award represents an unfunded, unsecured right to receive payment in the future, and does not entitle you to voting rights or dividend rights as a shareholder.

If your Termination of Employment occurs for any reason before a Vest Date except for the reasons listed below, the Award will be forfeited. For the purposes of this Award, Termination of Employment will be effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period required under local law. 
           1. 
    Termination on Account of Death or Disability  .  In the case of death or disability, the Award will be fully vested and payment will be made by the later of the end of the calendar year or two and a half months following the date of death or disability. 
              2. 
    Termination without Cause Pursuant to a Written Separation Agreement.    In the event of your Termination of Employment from the Company or a Subsidiary without Cause, your Award is forfeited unless the Chief Human Resources Officer authorizes the retention of the Award and you have executed a written separation agreement with the Company that provides for retention of the Award.  If the Award is retained pursuant to CHRO authorization, the Award will be delivered on the Settlement Date(s) as long as you remain in compliance with the terms of the Plan, the Regulations, and your separation agreement. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control, payment shall be made pursuant to the terms provided in the Plan. 
  Payment under this Award will be made in the form of Common Stock or such other form of payment as determined by the Committee pursuant to the Plan, subject to applicable tax withholding.
