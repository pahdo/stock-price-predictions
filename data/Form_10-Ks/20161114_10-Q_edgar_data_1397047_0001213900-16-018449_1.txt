CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
report contains certain  forward-looking statements,  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). We intend such
forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private
Securities Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions.  Forward-looking
statements,  which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, may be identified
by the use of such words as  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   should,   planned, 
 estimated  and  potential.  Examples of forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to,
estimates with respect to our financial condition, results of operations and business that are subject to various factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates and most other statements that are not historical in nature.
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on
our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections,
anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future,
they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which
are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated
in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: general and local economic conditions; competition, policies
or guidelines; changes in legislation or regulation; other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors
affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors
and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We caution readers not to place undue reliance
upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities
laws, we disclaim any obligation or undertaking to publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement
contained herein (or elsewhere) to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions
or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Our
interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X
and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) applicable
to interim financial information. Accordingly, the information presented in our interim financial statements does not include
all information and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
in conformity with GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all
adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for such periods. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results
for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 contained herein has been derived from audited financial statements.

BUSINESS   

FlexShopper,
Inc. (the  Company ) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 16, 2006. The Company
owns 100% of FlexShopper, LLC (collectively with its subsidiaries,  FlexShopper ), a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of North Carolina on September 24, 2013. In January 2015, in connection with the credit agreement entered into
in March 2015 (see Note 8), FlexShopper 1, LLC and FlexShopper 2, LLC were organized as wholly owned Delaware subsidiaries of
FlexShopper to conduct operations. Since the sale in 2014 of the assets of Anchor Funding Services LLC ( Anchor ),
the Company has been a holding company with no operations except for those conducted by FlexShopper. FlexShopper, through its
e-commerce marketplace and patent pending payment method, provides certain types of durable goods to consumers on a lease-to-own
basis ( LTO ) including consumers of third party retailers and e-retailers.  

During
2013, the Company decided to concentrate its efforts on the operations of FlexShopper and subsequently an agreement was entered
into with a financial institution to sell substantially all of the operating assets of Anchor, which provided accounts receivable
funding to businesses located throughout the United States. The 2015 consolidated statements of operations and cash flows reflects
the operations related to Anchor, including the gain on sale, as discontinued operations. (See Note 4)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Principles
of Consolidation -  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.  

Estimates
   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Revenue
Recognition  - Merchandise is leased to customers pursuant to lease purchase agreements which provide for weekly lease terms
with non-refundable lease payments. Generally, the customer has the right to acquire title either through a 90 day same as cash
option, an early purchase option, or through payments of all required lease payments, generally 52 weeks, for ownership. On any
current lease, customers have the option to cancel the agreement in accordance with lease terms and return the merchandise. Accordingly,
customer agreements are accounted for as operating leases with lease revenues recognized in the month they are due on the accrual
basis of accounting. Merchandise sales revenue is recognized when the customer exercises the purchase option and pays the purchase
price. Revenue from processing fees earned upon exercise by the customer of the 90 day purchase option is recorded upon recognition
of the related merchandise sales. Commencing in the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company discontinued charging a separate
fee upon exercise of such option. Revenue for lease payments received prior to their due date is deferred and recognized as revenue
in the period to which the payments relate. Revenues from leases and sales are reported net of sales taxes.  

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    FlexShopper seeks to collect amounts owed under its leases from each
customer on a weekly basis by charging their bank accounts or credit cards. Accounts receivable are principally comprised of lease
payments currently owed to FlexShopper which are past due as FlexShopper has been unable to successfully collect in the manner
described above. Through June 30, 2016, an allowance for doubtful accounts was estimated by reserving all accounts in excess of
four payments in arrears, adjusted for subsequent collections. Commencing in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the estimate
was revised to provide for doubtful accounts based upon revenues and historical experience of balances charged off as a percentage
of revenues. The accounts receivable balances consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The
allowance is a significant percentage of the balance because FlexShopper does not charge off any customer account until it has
exhausted all collection efforts with respect to each account including attempts to repossess items. In addition, while collections
are pursued, the same delinquent customers will continue to accrue weekly charges until they are charged off. Accounts receivable
balances charged off against the allowance were $1,043,762 and $2,786,979 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively and $534,771 and $801,004 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Lease Merchandise    Until
all payment obligations for ownership are satisfied under the lease agreement, the Company maintains ownership of the lease merchandise.
Lease merchandise consists primarily of residential furniture, consumer electronics, computers, appliances and household accessories
and is recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation. The Company depreciates lease merchandise using the straight line method
over the applicable agreement period for a consumer to acquire ownership, generally twelve months. However, in certain instances
where consumers take advantage of early payment options, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from lease
merchandise immediately. For lease merchandise returned or anticipated to be returned either voluntarily or through repossession,
the Company provides an impairment reserve for the undepreciated balance of the merchandise net of any estimated salvage value
with a corresponding charge to cost of lease revenue. The cost, accumulated depreciation and impairment reserve related to such
merchandise are written off upon determination that no salvage value is obtainable. The impairment charge amounted to approximately
$603,185 and $1,614,663 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,090,000 and $1,208,000 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The
net leased merchandise balances consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Cost
of lease merchandise sold represents the undepreciated cost at the time of sale.  

Deferred
Debt Issuance Costs -  Debt issuance costs incurred in conjunction with the Credit Agreement entered into on March 6, 2015
(see Note 8) are offset against the outstanding balance of the loan payable and are amortized using the straight line method over
the remaining term of the credit facility. Amortization which is included in interest expense was $118,405 and $332,900 for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $146,313 and $341,396 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively. The 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to transfer such amortization from operating expenses
to interest expense to conform to the current year presentation.  

Intangible
Assets -  Intangible assets consist of a pending patent on the Company s LTO payment method at check-out for third party
e-commerce sites. Patents are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Patent costs are amortized by using the straight line
method over the legal life, or if shorter, the useful life of the patent which has been estimated to be 10 years.  

Software
Costs -  Costs related to developing or obtaining internal-use software incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation
stages of an internal use software project are expensed as incurred and certain costs incurred in the project s application
development stage are capitalized as property and equipment.  The Company expenses costs related to the planning and
operating stages of a website. Costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for the website are included in expenses
as incurred. Direct costs incurred in the website s development stage are capitalized as property and equipment. Capitalized
software costs amounted to $507,738 and $1,355,187 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $326,878
and $827,707 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Operating
Expenses    Operating expenses include corporate overhead expenses such as stock based compensation, insurance, occupancy
and other administrative expenses.     

Per
Share Data    Per share data is computed by use of the two-class method as a result of outstanding Series 1 Convertible
Preferred Stock which participates in dividends with the common stock and accordingly has participation rights in undistributed
earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period (see Note 9). Under such method income available to common
shareholders is computed by deducting both dividends declared or, if not declared, accumulated on Series 2 Convertible Preferred
Stock from income from continuing operations and from net income. Loss attributable to common shareholders is computed by increasing
loss from continuing operations and net loss by such dividends. Where the Company has undistributed net income available to common
shareholders, basic earnings per common share is computed based on the total of any dividends paid or declared per common share
plus undistributed income per common share determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders reduced by any dividends
paid or declared on common and participating Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock by the total of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding plus the weighted average number of common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding participating
Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock during the period. Where the Company has a net loss, basic per share data (including income
from continuing operations) is computed based solely on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
As the convertible participating preferred stock has no contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company, common shares
issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock are not included in such computations.  

Diluted
earnings per share is based on the more dilutive of the if-converted method (which assumes conversion of the participating preferred
stock as of the beginning of the period) or the two-class method (which assumes that the participating preferred stock is not
converted) plus the potential impact of dilutive non-participating Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock, options and warrants.
The dilutive effect of stock options and warrants is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes the repurchase of
common shares at the average market price during the period. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants will have a
dilutive effect when the average price of common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of options or warrants.  When
there is a loss from continuing operations, potential common shares are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share,
since they have an anti-dilutive effect.  

In
computing diluted loss per share, no effect has been given to the issuance of common stock upon conversion or exercise of the
following securities as their effect is anti-dilutive:  

See Note 4  

Stock
Based Compensation -  The fair value of transactions in which the Company exchanges its equity instruments for employee services
(share-based payment transactions) is recognized as an expense in the financial statements as services are performed.  

Compensation
expense is determined by reference to the fair value of an award on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of all stock option
awards (see Note 10).  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    The carrying value of loans payable under the Credit Agreement increased by unamortized
issuance costs (see Note 8) approximates fair value.    

Income
Taxes    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating
loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting
amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when
management concludes that it is not more likely than not that such assets will be recognized.  

The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will
be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not recorded any
unrecognized tax benefits.  

Interest
and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be charged to interest and operating expenses, respectively.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU
2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which
requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company
early adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. In the accompanying balance sheets at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company offset $868,297 and $832,792, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to debt
issued under the Credit Agreement in March 2015 against the outstanding balance of loans payable under the Credit Agreement.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):
Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The amendments in this Update provide guidance to
customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a
software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition
of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account
for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance will not change GAAP for a customer s accounting for service contracts.
In addition, the guidance in this update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16. Consequently, all software licenses within the scope
of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The amendments in this guidance
which are effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods therein, were adopted by
the Company in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and had no effect on the financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 )
which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable
value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is
effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
effect the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the
presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position and apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
effect on the financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize
for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising
from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right
to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the
new guidance will have on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax
consequences, classification of awards, the option to recognize stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures as they occur,
and the classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements.

REVERSE STOCK SPLIT   

On
October 14, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of amendment (the  Certificate
of Amendment ) to its certificate of incorporation, which Certificate of Amendment effectuated as of October 24, 2016 at
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (the  Effective Time ) a reverse split of the Company s common stock by a ratio of one-for-10
(the  Reverse Split ). At the Effective Time, 52,870,398 outstanding shares of the Company s common stock
were exchanged for 5,287,040 shares of the Company s common stock. All per share amounts and number of shares in the consolidated
financial statements and related notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split resulting in the transfer
of $4,689 from common stock to additional paid in capital at January 1, 2016. No fractional shares were, or shall be, issued
in connection with the Reverse Split. A stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of common stock
is entitled to receive the fractional share rounded up to the next whole share. The Reverse Split did not change the number of
shares of common or preferred stock that the Company is authorized to issue, or the par value of the Company s common or
preferred stock.  

The
Reverse Split resulted in a proportionate adjustment to the per share conversion or exercise price and the number of shares of
common stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise of outstanding preferred stock, stock options and warrants, as well as the
number of shares of common stock eligible for issuance under the Company s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan and 2015
Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.  

5.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   

In
June 2014, Anchor sold to a bank substantially all of its assets (the  Anchor Assets ), consisting primarily of its
factoring portfolio. The purchase price for the Anchor Assets included an amount equal to 50% of the factoring fee and interest
income earned by Anchor s factoring portfolio during the 12 month period following acquisition ( Earnout Payments ).
The Earnout Payments totaled $206,177 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Anchor
recorded a gain of $127,789 net of an income tax provision of $78,388, for the Earnout Payments received during such periods,
which is included in income from discontinued operations.   

6.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   

Property
and equipment consist of the following:  

Depreciation
and amortization expense was $294,616 and $156,975 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $775,818
and $388,015 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which have been included in operating expenses.  

7.
LOANS PAYABLE TO SHAREHOLDER   

On
December 8, 2014, upon approval of the Company s Board of Directors, the Company entered into a promissory note for $1,000,000
with a shareholder and executive of the Company (the  Promissory Note ). The note was payable on demand. The note
was funded in increments of $500,000 on December 8 th  and 18 th  and earned interest at 15% per annum. The
Promissory Note was to assist FlexShopper in purchasing merchandise for lease and was paid in full with interest amounting to
$36,250 on March 11, 2015. See Note 8 regarding the loan entered into in 2016.  

8.
LOAN PAYABLE UNDER CREDIT AGREEMENT   

On March 6, 2015, FlexShopper entered
into a credit agreement (as amended from time to time, and including the Fee Letter (as defined therein), the  Credit Agreement )
with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as paying agent, various lenders from time to time party thereto and WE 2014-1, LLC
as administrative agent and lender (the  Lender ). FlexShopper is permitted to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement
based on FlexShopper s cash on hand and the Amortized Order Value of its Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the
Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions, FlexShopper may borrow up to $25,000,000 from the Lender for a term of two years from the
date of the Credit Agreement. The borrowing term may be extended in the sole discretion of the Lender. The Credit Agreement contemplates
that the Lender may provide additional debt financing to FlexShopper, up to $100 million in total, under two uncommitted accordions
following satisfaction of certain covenants and other terms and conditions. The Lender receives security interests in certain leases
as collateral under the Credit Agreement. Amounts borrowed bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 15% per annum and a small non-usage
fee is assessed on any undrawn amount if the facility is less than 80% drawn on average in any given measurement period commencing
three months after closing of the facility. Interest is payable monthly on the outstanding balance of amounts borrowed and, commencing
on and after May 6, 2017, principal together with interest thereon is payable periodically through May 6, 2018, the maturity date
of the loan. Principal payable within twelve months of the balance sheet date based on the outstanding loan balance at such date
is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheets. Interest expense incurred under the Credit Agreement amounted
to $340,955 and $1,061,392 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $141,113 and $250,575 for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under the Credit
Agreement was $7,788,208. The Company repaid $4,172,174 to the Lender in 2016 resulting primarily from the repayment of the Bridge
Loan Amount upon the Equity Raise as described in the fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement. 

The
Credit Agreement provides that FlexShopper may not incur additional indebtedness (other than expressly permitted indebtedness)
without the permission of the Lender and also prohibits dividends on common stock. The Credit Agreement includes customary events
of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms
of the Credit Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Lender, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications
made by or on behalf of FlexShopper in the Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain financial and expense covenants),
deficiencies in the borrowing base, certain judgments against FlexShopper and bankruptcy events.  

The
Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as of the last day of each
fiscal quarter during the term of the agreement minimum amounts of Unrestricted Cash and Equity Book Value and to achieve Adjusted
Operating Cash Flow of not less than certain amounts during such quarters (all such terms as defined in the Credit Agreement).
As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in violation of the covenant requiring an Equity Book Value of at least $7.0 million
as of such date. Under the fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement described below, the Lender waived this violation. The covenant
also requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain an Equity Book Value of at least $7 million at each of June 30, September
30 and December 31, 2016 increasing to $10 million at the end of each quarter from March 31 through December 31, 2017.  

On
February 11, 2016, FlexShopper entered into a third amendment (the  Third Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement which
amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, add a new financial covenant requiring FlexShopper to maintain at least $1,500,000
in Unrestricted Cash at all times.  

The
Third Amendment also includes a consent by the Lender to a $1,000,000 promissory note (the  Promissory Note ) in favor
of Marc Malaga, FlexShopper s Executive Vice President of Operations. Interest on the Promissory Note accrued at the rate
of 15.0% per annum and all outstanding principal and accrued interest was payable on demand by Mr. Malaga. The Promissory Note
which was issued in February 2016, was secured by substantially all of FlexShopper s assets. The Promissory Note was paid
in full with interest amounting to $51,250 on June 13, 2016.  

On
March 29, 2016, FlexShopper entered into a fourth amendment (the  Fourth Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement whereby
the Lender waived the violation of the Equity Book Value covenant at December 31, 2015, as well as compliance with financial covenants
(other than the unrestricted cash covenant) through the earlier of April 1, 2017 or the completion of the raising of at least
$10,000,000 in equity funding (the  Equity Raise ), which occurred upon the issuance of Series 2 Convertible Preferred
Stock on June 10, 2016 described in Note 9. In addition, the Fourth Amendment, among other things, provided that FlexShopper maintain
Unrestricted Cash of at least $500,000 on each day and $1,000,000 at the end of each calendar month. As of September 30, 2016,
FlexShopper was in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.  

In consideration of the Fourth Amendment,
FlexShopper was required to pay to the administrative agent a bridge fee of $20,000 per week until (i) the current amount of such
bridge fee equals $400,000 or (ii) the completion of the Equity Raise, whichever event occurred sooner, provided that such bridge
fee amounted to at least $250,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded $250,000 of deferred debt issuance costs with a corresponding
amount of accrued expenses. On June 10, 2016, the Company completed an equity raise in excess of $20 million providing for the
issuance and sale of shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the total
of the Bridge Fee and second amendment fee totaling $400,000 was paid by the Company.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE   

The
Company s capital structure consists of preferred and common stock as described below:  

The
Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of $.001 par value preferred stock. The Company s Board of Directors determines
the rights and preferences of the Company s preferred stock.  

Series
1 Convertible Preferred Stock    On January 31, 2007, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary
of State of Delaware. Effective with this filing, 2,000,000 preferred shares became Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock. Series
1 Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to common stock.  

As
of December 31, 2015, each share of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into 0.633 shares of the Company s
common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution rights. As a result of the Company entering into the Subscription Agreement referred
to below, each share of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock became convertible into approximately 0.606 shares of the Company s
common stock. The holders of the Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock has the option to convert the shares to common stock at
any time. Upon conversion, all accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, will be paid as additional shares of common stock. The
holders of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock have the same dividend rights as holders of common stock, as if the Series 1 Convertible
Preferred Stock had been converted to common stock.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, 14,022 shares of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into 8,876 shares of common
stock. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 85,132 shares of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into
51,632 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, there were 243,065 shares of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding
which are convertible into 147,417 shares of common stock.  

Series
2 Convertible Preferred Stock    On June 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with B2 FIE V LLC
(the  Investor ), an entity affiliated with Pacific Investment Management Company LLC, providing for the issuance
and sale of 20,000 shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $20.0 million. The Company sold an additional
1,950 shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $1.95 million at a subsequent closing.   

Pursuant
to the authority expressly granted to the Board of Directors by the provisions of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation,
the Board of Directors of the Company created and designated 25,000 shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$.001 per share ( Series 2 Preferred Shares ), by filing a Certificate of Designations with the Delaware Division
of Corporations (the  Series 2 Certificate of Designations ). The Series 2 Preferred Shares were sold for $1,000 per
share (the  Stated Value ) and accrue dividends on the Stated Value at an annual rate of 10% compounded annually.
Each Series 2 Preferred Share is convertible at a conversion price of $8.10 into approximately 124 shares of common stock; provided,
the conversion price is subject to reduction pursuant to a weighted average anti-dilution provision contained in the Series 2
Certificate of Designations. Beginning 45 days following the date of issuance of the Series 2 Preferred Shares (the  Initial
Period ), the holders of the Series 2 Preferred Shares have the option to convert such shares into shares of common stock
and have the right to vote with holders of common stock on an as-converted basis. If, during the two year period commencing on
the date of issuance, the average closing price during any 45 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $17.50 per common
share, or a change of control transaction (as defined in the Series 2 Certificate of Designations) values the Company s
common stock at $17.50 per share or greater; or after this two year period the average closing price during any 45 day consecutive
trading day period or change of control transaction values the common stock at a price equal to or greater than $23.00 per share,
then conversion shall be automatic. Upon a Liquidation Event or Deemed Liquidation Event (each as defined in the Series 2 Certificate
of Designations), holders of Series 2 Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company prior to
and in preference to the common stock and Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock an amount equal to the greater of (1) the Stated
Value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and (2) the amount per share as would have been payable had all Series 2
Preferred Shares been converted to common stock immediately before the Liquidation Event or Deemed Liquidation Event.  

Common
Stock    The Company, which was authorized to issue 65,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value common stock, after obtaining
stockholder approval and filing an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, increased its authorized shares to 100,000,000 in September 2015. Each share of common stock entitles the
holder to one vote at all stockholder meetings.  

In
connection with entering into the Credit Agreement on March 6, 2015, the Company raised approximately $8.6 million in net proceeds
through direct sales of 1.7 million shares of its common stock to certain affiliates of the Lender and other accredited investors
for a purchase price of $5.50 per share. As a result of the sale to certain affiliates, the Lender is considered a beneficial
shareholder of the Company.  

On
March 17, 2016, the Company s stockholders, acting by written consent, approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. On October 14, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of amendment (the  Certificate of Amendment ) to its certificate of
incorporation, which Certificate of Amendment effectuated as of October 24, 2016 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (the  Effective
Time ) the Reverse Split by a ratio of one-for-10 (see Note 4).   

10.
STOCK OPTIONS   

On
January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted our 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the  2007 Plan ), with
210,000 common shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. In October 2009, the Company s stockholders approved an increase
in the number of shares covered by the Plan to 420,000 shares. On March 26, 2015, the Board adopted our 2015 Omnibus Equity Compensation
Plan (the  2015 Plan ), with 400,000 common shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which was ratified
by the Company s stockholders on September 15, 2015. The 2007 Plan and 2015 Plan are collectively referred to as the  Plans. 
Grants under the Plans may consist of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards,
stock unit awards, dividend equivalents and other stock based awards. Employees, directors and consultants and other service providers
are eligible to participate in the Plans. Options granted under the Plans vest over periods ranging from immediately upon grant
to a three year period and expire ten years from date of grant.  

Activity
in stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 follows:   

The
weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2016 was $0.40 per share. The Company measured the fair value
of each option award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions:  

The
expected dividend yield is based on the Company s historical dividend yield. The expected volatility was based on the average
of historical volatilities for a period comparable to the expected life of the options of certain entities considered to be similar
to the Company. The expected life is based on the simplified expected term calculation permitted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ) which defines the expected life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the
weighted-average vesting period for all option tranches. The risk-free interest rate is based on the annual yield on the grant
date of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond the maturity of which equals the option s expected life.  

The
value of stock options is recognized as compensation expense by the straight line method over the vesting period. Compensation
expense recorded for options in the statements of operations was $45,863 and $124,244, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively and $29,900 and $58,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested options at September 30, 2016 amounted to approximately $120,000 which is expected to
be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.      

11.
WARRANTS   

On
June 24, 2016, the Company granted warrants to one of the Company s placement agents to purchase 439 shares of the Company s
Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $1,250 per share. The exercise price and aggregate number
of shares are subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement.  

The
following information was input into the Black Scholes pricing model to compute a fair value of $342.71 for each warrant for a
total fair value of $150,451.  

The
following table summarizes information about outstanding stock warrants as of September 30, 2016, all of which are exercisable:  

12.
     INCOME TAXES   

As
of December 31, 2015, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8.4 million and state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $5.2 million available to offset future taxable income, which expire from 2021 to 2035.  The
Company s use of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.  Management
believes that the deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2016 does not satisfy the realization criteria and has recorded a valuation
allowance to offset the tax asset.  By recording a valuation allowance for the entire amount of future tax benefits,
the Company has not recognized a deferred tax benefit related to its loss from continuing operations other than a benefit related
to utilizing such loss to offset income from discontinued operations in 2015. A corresponding tax provision was charged to discontinued
operations.  

ITEM
2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial
statements and the related notes appearing at the end of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Some of the
information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, including information with respect
to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
The  Risk Factors  section of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 should be read for a discussion
of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.  

Executive
Overview   

The
results of operations from continuing operations below principally reflect the operations of FlexShopper, LLC ( FlexShopper ),
which provides certain types of durable goods to consumers on a lease-to-own basis and also provides lease-to-own terms to consumers
of third party retailers and e-retailers. FlexShopper began generating revenues from this line of business in December 2013. Management
believes that the introduction of FlexShopper s lease-to-own ( LTO ) programs support broad untapped expansion
opportunities within the U.S. consumer e-commerce and retail marketplaces. FlexShopper and its online LTO platforms provide consumers
the ability to acquire durable goods, including electronics, computers and furniture, on an affordable payment, lease basis. Concurrently,
e-retailers and retailers that work with FlexShopper may increase their sales by utilizing FlexShopper s online channels
to connect with consumers that want to acquire products on an LTO basis. FlexShopper s sales channels include (1) serving
as the financial and technology partner for durable goods retailers and e-retailers, (2) selling directly to consumers via the
online FlexShopper LTO Marketplace featuring thousands of durable goods and (3) utilizing FlexShopper s patent pending LTO
payment method at check out on e-commerce sites.  

Summary
of Critical Accounting Policies   

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to credit provisions, intangible assets, contingencies, litigation and income taxes.  Management bases its
estimates and judgments on historical experience as well as various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, reflect the more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our financial statements.  

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    The Company seeks to collect amounts owed under its leases from each
customer on a weekly basis by charging their bank account or credit/debit card. Accounts receivable are principally comprised
of lease payments currently owed to the Company which are past due as the Company has been unable to successfully collect in the
manner described above. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 79% of the Company s active leases were current and did
not have a past due balance and an additional 14% were past due with balances of one to four payments. An allowance for doubtful
accounts is estimated based upon historical collection and delinquency percentages. The accounts receivable balances consisted
of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company s reserve is 89% of the accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2016. The reserve is a significant percentage
of the balance because the Company does not charge off any customer accounts until it has exhausted all collection efforts including
attempts to repossess items. While collection efforts are pursued, delinquent customers accrue weekly charges resulting in a significant
balance requiring a reserve. The Company charges off accounts once it has exhausted collection efforts and estimates that there
is no chance of recovery.  

Lease
Merchandise    Until all payment obligations required for ownership are satisfied under the lease agreement, FlexShopper
maintains ownership of the lease merchandise. Lease merchandise consists primarily of residential furniture, consumer electronics,
computers, appliances and household accessories and is recorded at cost. FlexShopper depreciates leased merchandise using the
straight line method over the applicable agreement period for a consumer to acquire ownership generally twelve months with no
salvage value.  

Stock
Based Compensation -  The fair value of transactions in which FlexShopper exchanges its equity instruments for employee services
(share-based payment transactions) is recognized as an expense in the financial statements as services are performed. Compensation
expense is determined by reference to the fair value of an award on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period. We have elected to use the Black Scholes pricing model (BSM) to determine the fair value of all stock
option awards.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     

The
following table details the operating results from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Total
lease revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $12,327,924 compared to $5,406,040 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $6,921,884, or 128.0%. FlexShopper originated 15,594 leases for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 7,969 leases for the comparable period last year. Increased marketing expense is primarily
responsible for the increase in revenue and leases.  

Cost
of lease revenue and merchandise sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,708,580 compared to $2,817,615 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $2,890,965 or 102.6%. Cost of lease revenue and merchandise
sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised of depreciation expense on lease merchandise of $5,525,701 and
the net book value of merchandise sold of $182,879. Cost of lease revenue and merchandise sold for the three months ended September
30, 2015 was comprised of depreciation expense on lease merchandise of $2,683,569, the net book value of merchandise sold of $57,622
and a charge for inventory impairment of $76,424. As the Company s lease revenues increase, the direct costs associated
with them also increase.  

Provision
for doubtful accounts was $3,501,023 and $1,672,064 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A factor
that caused the provision to increase is that the Company does not charge off any customer accounts until it has exhausted all
collection efforts, including attempts to repossess items. While collection efforts are pursued, delinquent customers continue
to accrue weekly charges resulting in a significant balance requiring a reserve. The Company anticipates continued improvement
as it continues to refine its underwriting model, enhances its risk department and accumulates additional lease data. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $1,043,762 and $534,771 of accounts receivable balances were charged off against
the allowance, respectively, after the Company exhausted all collection efforts with respect to such accounts.  

Marketing
expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $2,442,243, compared to $924,957 in the third quarter of 2015 for an increase of $1,517,286.
Increased marketing expense is primarily responsible for the increase in revenues and leases.  

Salary
and benefits expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $1,522,792, compared to $1,098,621 in the third quarter of 2015 for an
increase of $424,171. The staff needed to support the increase in leases and revenue and increases in our software development
personnel are the primary reason for the increase in salaries and benefits.  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,307,418 and $755,186, respectively. Key operating expenses
included the following:  

The
increased revenues were offset by the increase in expenses to scale the Company s lease-to-own channels and support its
growth resulting in a loss from continuing operations of $2,613,492 and $2,149,828 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine months Ended September 30, 2015    

The
following table details the operating results from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Total
lease revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $33,253,090 compared to $13,518,785 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $19,734,305 or 145.9%. FlexShopper originated 35,741 leases for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 17,980 leases for the comparable period last year. FlexShopper began originating leases in
late December 2013, launched its online LTO marketplace in March 2014 and spent approximately $3,796,875 more on marketing in
the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. Increased marketing expense is primarily responsible
for the increase in revenues and leases.  

Cost
of lease revenue and merchandise sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was comprised of depreciation expense on lease
merchandise of $15,805,538, the net book value of merchandise sold of $498,594 and a reserve for inventory impairment of $1,011,478.
Cost of lease revenue and merchandise sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was comprised of depreciation expense
on lease merchandise of $6,923,455, the net book value of merchandise sold of $228,964 and a charge for inventory impairment of
$194,422. As the Company s lease revenues increase, the direct costs associated with them also increase.   

Provision
for doubtful accounts was $9,260,469 and $3,723,701 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A factor
that causes the provision to increase is that the Company does not charge off any customer accounts until it has exhausted all
collection efforts including attempts to repossess items and while collection efforts are pursued, delinquent customers continue
to accrue weekly charges resulting in a significant balance requiring a reserve. The Company anticipates continued improvement
as it continues to refine its underwriting model, enhances its risk department and accumulates additional lease data. The Company
has charged off $2,786,979 and $801,004 of customer accounts to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, after it exhausted all collection efforts with respect to such accounts.    

Marketing
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $6,186,417, compared to $2,389,542 in the same period of 2015 for an
increase of $3,796,875. The increase in marketing expense is the primary driver for the increase in revenues and leases.  

Salary
and benefits expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,258,753, compared to $2,898,982 in the same period
of 2015 for an increase of $1,359,771. The staff needed to support the increase in leases and revenue is the primary reason for
the increase in salaries and benefits.  

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,546,215 and $2,096,875 respectively. Key operating expenses
included the following:  

The
increased revenues were offset by the increase in expenses to scale the Company s lease-to-own channels and support its
growth resulting in a loss from continuing operations after income tax benefit of $8,759,916 and $5,479,889 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Plan
of Operation   

We
plan to promote our FlexShopper products and services across all sales channels through strategic partnerships, direct response
marketing, and affiliate and internet marketing, all of which are designed to increase our lease transactions and name recognition.
Our advertisements emphasize such features as instant spending limit, and affordable weekly payments. We believe that as the FlexShopper
name gains familiarity and national recognition through our advertising efforts, we will continue to educate our customers and
potential customers about the lease-to-own payment alternative as well as solidify our reputation as a leading provider of high
quality branded merchandise and services.  

For
each of our sales channels, FlexShopper has a marketing strategy that includes the following:  

Online LTO Marketplace   
       
       Patent pending LTO Payment Method   
       
       In-store LTO technology platform    
 
      Search engine optimization; pay-per click  
       
      Direct to retailers/e-retailers  
       
      Direct to retailers/e-retailers   
 
      Online affiliate networks  
       
      Partnerships with payment aggregators  
       
      Consultants   strategic relationships   
 
      Direct response television campaigns  
       
      Consultants   strategic relationships  

Direct mail  

The
Company believes it has a competitive advantage over competitors in the LTO industry by providing all three channels as a bundled
package to retailers and e-retailers. Management is anticipating a rapid development of the FlexShopper business as we are able
to penetrate each of our sales channels. To support our anticipated growth, FlexShopper will need the availability of substantial
capital resources. See the section captioned  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $13,093,333 compared to $4,667,561 at the same date in 2015.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had accounts receivable of $12,583,233 offset by an allowance for doubtful accounts of $11,200,768
resulting in net accounts receivable of $1,382,465. Accounts receivable are principally comprised of lease payments owed to the
Company. An allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical collection and delinquency percentages.  

Recent
Financings   

In
fiscal 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FlexShopper completed the following transactions, each of which has
provided liquidity and cash resources to FlexShopper.  

1.  
         
      On
    March 6, 2015, FlexShopper entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) among FlexShopper 2, LLC,
    Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, various Lenders from time to time party thereto and WE2014-1, LLC (the  Lender ).
    FlexShopper is permitted to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement based on FlexShopper s cash on hand and the Amortized
    Order Value of its Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in
    the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, FlexShopper
    may borrow up to $25,000,000 from the Lender for a term of two years; however, as of the date hereof, there was only approximately
    $15,380,000 in additional availability under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contemplates that the Lender may provide
    additional debt financing to FlexShopper, up to $100 million in total, under two uncommitted accordions following satisfaction
    of certain covenants and other terms and conditions. The Lender will receive security interests in certain leases as collateral
    under the Credit Agreement. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, on March 6, 2015, FlexShopper raised approximately
    $8.6 million in net proceeds through direct sales of 17.0 million shares of FlexShopper common stock to certain affiliates
    of the Lender and other accredited investors for a purchase price of $0.55 per share.   

2.  
         
       On
        February 11, 2016, FlexShopper entered into a secured promissory note with a principal stockholder for $1,000,000 at an
        interest rate of 15% per annum, payable upon demand, secured by substantially all of the Company s assets.  

3.  
         
       On
        March 29, 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment and waiver (the  Fourth Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement.
        The Fourth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the amount of the Borrowing Base (as
        defined in the Credit Agreement) until the earlier of (i) April 1, 2017 and (ii) the successful raising by the Company
        of at least $10,000,000 in equity funding (the  Equity Raise ). The Fourth Amendment also includes a waiver
        of (i) breaches resulting from the Borrower s non-compliance with certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement
        that occurred prior to the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment and (ii) compliance with certain financial covenants
        under the Credit Agreement for the period from the date of the Fourth Amendment through the earlier of April 1, 2017 or
        the completion of the Equity Raise. If we were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement
        by the earlier of April 1, 2017 or the completion of the Equity Raise or we fail to maintain compliance with the covenants
        thereafter, the Lender would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due under the Credit Agreement and,
        if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon our assets securing our obligations under the Credit Agreement.  

4.  
         
      On
    June 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with B2 FIE V LLC, an entity affiliated with Pacific Investment
    Management Company LLC, providing for the issuance and sale of 20,000 shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock for gross
    proceeds of $20.0 million. In addition, the Company sold an additional 1,950 shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock
    to certain other investors at a subsequent closing in June 2016 for gross proceeds of $1.95 million.

proceeds from the sale of the Company s stock, offset by payments of $801,806 in issuance costs offset by a $1,000,000 repayment
of a note to a shareholder of the Company.  

Capital
Resources   

The
funds derived from the sale of FlexShopper s Common Stock and Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock and FlexShopper s
ability to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement have provided the liquidity and capital resources necessary for FlexShopper
to purchase durable goods pursuant to lease-to-own transactions and to support FlexShopper s current general working capital
needs. Management believes that the financing transactions described in this section above provide sufficient liquidity and capital
resources for our anticipated needs through at least September 30, 2017.

4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure based closely on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e). In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level at September 30, 2016.  

There
were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.
