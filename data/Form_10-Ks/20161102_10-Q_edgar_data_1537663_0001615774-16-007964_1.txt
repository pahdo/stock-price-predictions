NOTE 1   Business and Basis of Presentation  

Health-Right Discoveries, Inc. (the   Company  )
was formed under the laws of the State of Florida on October 12, 2011 under the name Four Plex Partners, Inc. The company changed
its name to Health-Right Discoveries, Inc. on March 22, 2012. The Company s business is to develop and market an innovative
portfolio of both prescription nutritional, OTC monograph and natural products that primarily focus on factors relating to stress-induced
conditions and diseases. 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management,
the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
to present the financial position of the Company as September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 filed with the SEC on April 13, 2016. 

NOTE 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain of the Company s estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique
to its industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on the Company s
estimates that could cause actual results to differ from its estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates
at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary. 

Cash   

The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments
with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company follows the guidance of the
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition . We record revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. The Company has not experienced any significant returns from customers and
accordingly, in management s opinion, no reserve for returns has been provided. 

Inventories  

Inventories, which consist of the Company s
product held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out, and net realizable value. Net
realizable value is the estimated selling price, in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs to complete and dispose
of the product. 

If the Company identifies excess, obsolete
or unsalable items, its inventories are written down to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified.  Shipping
and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of sales in the Company's statements
of operations. 

Fair Value Measurements  

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC
Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 

The estimated fair value of certain financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical
cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of
our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include
contractual interest rates are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1   quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

 Level 2   quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 

 Level 3   inputs
that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 

The Company does not have any assets or
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Stock-based compensation  

The Company recognizes compensation expense
for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718. For employee stock-based awards, the fair value of the award is
calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method for stock options and the quoted price of our common stock for common
shares; the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. For non-employee stock-based awards, the
fair value of the award on the date of grant is calculated in the same manner as employee awards. However, the awards are revalued
at the end of each reporting period and the pro rata compensation expense is adjusted accordingly until such time the nonemployee
award is fully vested, at which time the total compensation recognized to date equals the fair value of the stock-based award as
calculated on the measurement date, which is the date at which the award recipient s performance is complete. The estimation
of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ
from original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. 

Advertising  

Advertising and marketing expenses are charged to operations
as incurred. 

Income Taxes  

The company uses the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax
expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences
of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it
is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods
presented. 

NOTE 3   Going Concern  

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception. The Company has sustained losses since inception,
and has a stockholders  deficiency of $358,746 at September 30, 2016. These factors among others raise substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.   

The continuing operations of the Company
are dependent upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future and
repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations as they become due. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

NOTE 4   Stockholders  Equity  

The Company has authorized 100,000,000
shares of common stock $.001 par value and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock $.001 par value. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 the Company issued 400,000 shares of common stock for services rendered which were valued at $40,000. The Company valued
these shares based on the per share price in which unaffiliated investors purchased shares of common stock in a private placement. 

During the period ended September 30, 2015,
the Company issued 10,000 shares of common stock for services rendered which were valued at $1,000. The Company valued these shares
based on the per share price in which unaffiliated investors purchased shares of common stock in a private placement. 

NOTE 5   Related Party  

The Company has a secured promissory note
with a founder and director ( director ) of the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were
no advances on this note. These borrowing bear interest at 3% per annum with no maturity date. As of September 30, 2016 the principle
balance due on this note was $45,000. 

Effective July 30, 2015 the Company entered
into a secured future advance promissory note with the director referred to above for a total amount of $75,000. During the nine
months ended September, 2016 the Company borrowed $25,000 in regards to this note. The note bears interest at 7.5% per annum and
matures on July 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 the principal balance due on this note was $106,845. 

On April 13, 2016 a director of the Company
provided a short term loan of $2,500 with an interest rate of 3% and is payable on demand. 

On July 22, 2016 the President of the Company
provided a short term loan of $2,000 with an interest rate of 3% and is payable on demand. 

The Company s President has made
loans the Company through direct charges on his credit card to pay for working capital purposes. The balance of this loan at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $1,009 respectively. 

The Company s board of directors
approved a salary to the Company s president in the amount of $52,000 per annum plus a car allowance of $600 per month. As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the amount unpaid and accrued amount is $156,000 and $130,000 respectively. Effective
in August 2013, the president waived his car allowance which amount has not been accrued since that date. The president resumed
his car allowance in July of 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the president has begun being paid a salary of $1,000 per week. Due
to lack of funding for the period ended September 30, 2016 the president has continued to accrue salary. The Company has also
accrued his car allowance for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 6   Credit card payable  

The Company utilizes a credit card for
working capital purposes. The card has a credit limit of $9,000, with a balance of $7,718 and $7,222 outstanding at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively and bears interest at 21.49% per annum. 

NOTE 7   Income Taxes  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
approximately $965,000 of federal and state net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs ) which begin to expire in 2031.  Utilization
of the NOLs may be subject to limitation under the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 should there be a greater than 50% ownership
change as determined under regulations.   

In assessing the realization of deferred
tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  Based
on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

The Company files U.S. federal and state
of Florida tax returns that are subject to audit by tax authorities beginning with the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company s
policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax and related interest and penalties as tax expense. 

NOTE 8   Subsequent events  

Management has evaluated subsequent events
through, the date which the financial statements were available to be issued.

Background  

Health-Right is a natural biotech company
that combines science and nutrition to develop branded ingredients, formulations and products that seek to provide a better quality
of life for consumers who primarily suffer from stress-induced viruses and diseases. These formulations and products are developed
naturally, by utilizing and scientifically combining various ingredients to help positively influence the interrelationship between
stress and the immune system. 

The Company believes the formulation platform
it has developed in order to help address the negative nutritional interrelationship between stress, a weakened immune system and
certain conditions and diseases is now in place. At the end of 2014, Health-Right completed initial test-marketing of Advanced
H-Plex Defense Formula 11, its first product (  H-Plex Defense  ), an all-natural dietary supplement whose formulation
seeks to address less than optimal nutrition and nutritional deficiencies to aid persons afflicted with Herpes Simplex Virus 1
(  HSV-1  ). Based on customer feedback, HRD believes that it has developed an alternative approach to help counteract
and improve the causes/triggers of HSV-1, a virus that affects over an estimated 100 million people in the U.S. alone with symptoms
including tingling, itching, blisters, sores and rashes with an estimated $5 billion marketplace for treatments by 2017, according
to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
has not conducted formal clinical trials of H-Plex Defense. Subject to receipt of necessary funding, the Company intends to do
so, utilizing the services of Miami Research Associates (  MRA  ), one of the largest, multi-special clinical
research centers in the United States. Management has had multiple meetings and discussion with MRA and has negotiated Protocol
Development Agreement for clinical trials, the finalization and execution of which is subject to receipt of necessary funding. 

We believe that Health-Right is uniquely
positioned because its approach of not just responding to stress induced conditions and diseases, but proactively addressing stress-induced
problems before they wreak havoc on multiple body systems. The Company s research, formulation and nutritional theories offer
wide ranging potential because we believe that our formulation platform has the potential to be successfully applied In the prescription
nutritional/medical foods, OTC monograph drug and all-natural dietary supplement/nutraceutical arenas. HRD anticipates that it
will be able to leverage the results of its planned clinical trials in order to market ingredients, branded ingredients, private
label ingredients and finished products. We also believe that we will be positioned to license our formulations to strategic partners
in order to expedite and achieve product commercialization and cross-promotion. 

In addition to its initial product, the
Company plans to focus its efforts on areas where it believes that HRD can commercialize and market products on an expedited basis.
We believe that are other potential applications for our formulations that we have in the pipeline, including all-natural products
designed to relieve symptoms associated with: 

compromised immune systems and related muscle and joint pain;   

the common cold and flu viruses; and   

constipation resulting from prescription medications.   

By adapting its formulation platform to
applications such as these, the Company believes that it will be able to generate revenues in the short term in the following markets: 

the Over-the-Counter (  OTC  ) monograph drug industry;   

the prescription nutritional marketplace; and   

the natural products space.   

The Company intends to use its contacts
in the healthcare, medical foods and natural products industries to market and sell its proposed products either directly or through
strategic partners and licensees. 

In addition to the foregoing, the Company
is exploring various opportunities for growth and revenue generation through the acquisition of complementary products, technologies
or companies. 

To date, the Company has generated limited
revenues and has operated with limited capital. The Company will require significant capital to implement its business plan. There
can be no assurance that the Company can raise the necessary funds, on favorable terms or otherwise. Failure to obtain sufficient
capital will substantially harm the Company s prospects.

Results of Operations  

Nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015   

We had revenues of $8,959 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $18,101 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting the tapering off
of trial-marketing of H-Plex Defense. Cost of sales were $3.054 in the 2016 period as compared to $3,776 in the 2015 period, which
resulted in gross profit of $5,905 in the 2016 period, as compared to $14,325 in the 2015 period. 

General and administrative costs were $120,771
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $64,047 in the comparable period in 2015, primarily reflecting increased
expenses related to the implementation of the Company s business plan and incurred as a public company with the Company having
had its initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 having been declared effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
the fourth quarter of 2015. Interest expense to related parties increased to $18,680 in the 2016 period from $3,479 in the 2015
period, reflecting the increased principal balance of shareholder loans. 

Net losses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were $133,546 and $53,201, respectively. 

Three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to three months ended September 30, 2015   

We had revenues of $1,279 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $4,520 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting the tapering off
of trial-marketing of H-Plex Defense. Cost of sales declined to $524 in the 2016 period from $1,124 in the 2015 period, which resulted
in gross profit of $755 in the 2016 quarter, as compared to $3,408 in the 2015 quarter. 

General and administrative costs were $19,974
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $27,962 in the comparable period in 2015, reflecting limitations in
2016 on the Company s capital resources related to the implementation of the its business plan. Interest expense to related
parties increased to $7,328 in the 2016 period from $1,094 in the 2015 period, reflecting the increased principal balance of shareholder
loans. 

Net losses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were $26,547 and $25,648, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, total assets
were $621, as compared to $4,226 on December 31, 2015. Total current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $359,367, as compared
to $269,426 as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the increase in principal balance of shareholder loans. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we raised $29,500 through shareholder loans, which was offset by repayments of $1,010 in shareholder loans. 

Net cash used in operating activities was
$29,903 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the $13,828 for the same period in 2015. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
in the 2016 period was $28,490, as compared to $38,770 in the 2015 period reflecting the increased balance of shareholder loans. 

Our primary source of capital to develop
and implement our business plan has been from private placements of our securities and shareholder loans. 

The Company will require additional financing
to complete development to commercially launch and market its planned products. Our independent auditors report for the year ended
December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph strategy that our lack of revenues and working capital raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue a growing concern. While we are seeking to raise additional financing, either through government
grants and loans or additional securities or offerings, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to
the Company when needed, on favorable terms or otherwise. Moreover, any such additional financing may dilute the interests of existing
shareholders. The absence of additional financing, when needed, could cause the Company to delay implementation of its business
plan in whole or in part, curtail its business activities and seriously harm the Company and its prospects. 

Item 3.      Quantitative Disclosures
About Market Risks.   

As a   smaller reporting company,  
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures.   

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  

Our President, as our sole executive officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the   Exchange Act  ), as amended,
as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ), including to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our President, as our Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President has concluded that as of September
30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses
identified and described in  Item 9A(b ) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Our President does not expect that our
disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures
were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer has determined
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.      Legal Proceedings.   

We know of no material, existing or pending
legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There
are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse
party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
