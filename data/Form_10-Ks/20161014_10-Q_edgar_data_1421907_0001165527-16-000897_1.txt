Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") to the "Company", "we", "us", "our", "Trident"
and  "Trident  Brands"  or  similar  words and  phrases  are to  Trident  Brands
Incorporated and its subsidiaries, taken together.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This  Form  10-Q  contains  forward-looking  statements  which  are based on our
current  expectations  and  assumptions  and  involve  a  number  of  risks  and
uncertainties.  Generally,  forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to
historical  or  current  facts and are  typically  accompanied  by words such as
"anticipate",   "estimate",   "intend",  "project",   "potential",   "continue",
"believe", "expect", "could", "would", "should", "might", "plan", "will", "may",
"predict",  the negatives of such terms, and words and phrases of similar impact
and include, but are not limited to references to expected increases in revenues
and margins, growth opportunities,  the success of new product launches and line
extensions,   our  ability  to  finance  our   business,   potential   strategic
investments,  business strategies,  competitive strengths,  goals, references to
key  markets  where  we  operate  and  the  market  for  our  securities.  These
forward-looking  statements  are made pursuant to the safe harbor  provisions of
the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.  These  forward-looking
statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we make in light of our
experience and our interpretation of current  conditions,  historical trends and
expected  future  developments,  as well as other  factors  that we believe  are
appropriate in the circumstance.

Whether actual results and  developments  will agree with our  expectations  and
predictions is subject to many risks and uncertainties.  Accordingly,  there are
or will be  important  factors  that could  cause our  actual  results to differ
materially  from our  expectations  and  predictions.  We believe  these factors
include, but are not limited to, the following:

     *    we have a limited operating history with significant losses and expect
          losses to continue for the foreseeable future;

     *    there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to
          recurring losses from operations, an accumulated deficit and
          insufficient cash resources on hand to meet our business objectives,
          all of which means that we may not be able to continue operations;

     *    we could face intense competition, which could result in lower
          revenues and higher expenditures and could adversely affect our
          results of operations;

     *    we are governed by only three persons serving as directors which may
          lead to faulty corporate governance;

     *    we must attract and maintain key personnel or our business may fail;

     *    we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future
          capital needs due to changes in general economic conditions;

     *    our business and operating results could be harmed if we fail to
          manage our growth or change;

     *    we have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in
          growing our business, then we may have to scale back or even cease our
          ongoing business operations;

     *    if our intellectual property is not adequately protected, then we may
          not be able to compete effectively and we may not be profitable;

                                       3
 
     *    if we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim,
          the cost of participating in any litigation could impact our ability
          to stay in business;

     *    we could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect
          any of our food and nutritional products and intellectual property
          rights against infringement, and any related litigation could be
          time-consuming and costly;

     *    if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business
          results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources
          may be strained;

     *    our services may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to
          respond adequately to rapidly changing technology and customer
          demands;

     *    our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences
          and demand for new products or product enhancements could
          significantly harm product sales and harm our financial condition and
          operating results;

     *    if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately
          meet the changing needs of our customers, some of our products could
          fail in the marketplace, which could negatively impact our revenues,
          financial condition and operating results;

     *    we are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential
          penalties or claims, which could harm our financial condition and
          operating results;

     *    since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and
          supply of certain of our products, if these third parties fail to
          reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which
          are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws, then our
          financial condition and operating results would be harmed;

     *    we may incur material product liability claims, which could increase
          our costs and harm our financial condition and operating results;

     *    unless we can generate sufficient cash from operations or raise
          additional funds, we may not be able to meet our debt obligations;

     *    our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing
          products from us;

     *    if we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating
          results may be adversely affected;

     *    our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses to our
          shareholders;

     *    our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable
          to sell at or near ask prices, or at all;

     *    the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given
          our status as a relatively small and developing company, which could
          lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our shareholders may be
          unable to sell your common stock at or above their purchase price if
          at all, which may result in substantial losses;

                                       4
 
     *    we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common
          shareholders and as a result shareholders may only realize a return
          when the shares are sold;

     *    we are listed on the OTCQB quotation system and our common stock is
          subject to "penny stock" rules which could negatively impact our
          liquidity and our shareholders' ability to sell their shares;

     *    volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities
          litigation;

     *    the elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers
          and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification
          rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in
          substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits
          against our directors, officers and employees; and

     *    our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate
          governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs
          and the risk of noncompliance.

Consequently all  forward-looking  statements made herein are qualified by these
cautionary  statements  and there can be no assurance that our actual results or
the  developments we anticipate will be realized.  The foregoing  factors should
not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction  with the other
cautionary statements that are included in this report.

                                 August 31, 2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Trident Brands  Incorporated (f/k/a Sandfield Ventures Corp.) ("we", "our", "the
Company") was incorporated  under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 5,
2007.  The  Company  was formed to engage in the  acquisition,  exploration  and
development of natural resource properties.

The Company is now focused on the development of high growth consumer brands and
ingredients  within  the  nutritional  supplement,  life  sciences  and food and
beverage  categories.  The  Company  is  in  its  early  growth  stage  and  has
transitioned  out of its  shell  status  with the  Super-8  filing at the end of
August,  2014.  Activities  to date  have been  limited  to  capital  formation,
organization,  development of its business plan, and  development of an array of
products for sale and initial commercialization efforts.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United  States  of  America  and  the  rules  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission,  and  should  be read in  conjunction  with  the  audited  financial
statements and notes thereto contained in Trident's Form 10-K filed with SEC. In
the opinion of  management,  all  adjustments,  consisting  of normal  recurring
adjustments,  necessary for a fair  presentation  of financial  position and the
results of operations  for the interim  periods  presented  have been  reflected
herein.  The  results of  operations  for interim  periods  are not  necessarily
indicative  of the  results  to be  expected  for the  full  year.  Notes to the
financial   statements  which  would  substantially   duplicate  the  disclosure
contained  in the audited  financial  statements  for fiscal 2015 as reported on
Form 10-K have been omitted.

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN

The  accompanying  financial  statements are presented on a going concern basis.
The  Company has had minimal  revenues  during the period from  November 5, 2007
(date of inception) to August 31, 2016 and has a working  capital  deficit as of
August 31, 2016. These conditions  raise  substantial  doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going  concern.  The Company is  currently in the early
growth stage at product  introduction  phase and expenses  are  increasing.  The
Company  has secured  financing  to cover these  expenses.  The current  cash of
$4,484 is  insufficient  to cover the expenses the Company will incur during the
next  twelve  months.  The  Company  is  currently  pursuing  various  financing
alternatives  in order to address  this issue and as  detailed in note 9 entered
into a  securities  purchase  agreement  on  September  26, 2016 for proceeds of
$4,100,000.  The proceeds of this  financing are to be used for general  working
capital purposes,  including without limitation,  settlement of accounts payable
and repayment of mature debt.

NOTE 4. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS

On May 1, 2016,  100,000 stock options were granted to Steve Bromley,  a Special
Advisor to the Company and Chair of our Advisory  Committee,  with 50,000 of the
options  exercisable at a price of $1.25 per share,  vesting May 1, 2017 and the

remaining 50,000 options exercisable at a price of $1.50 per share,  vesting May
1, 2018. All 100,000  options expire on May 1, 2021. On June 1, 2016 the Company
issued to Mr.  Bromley an additional  200,000 stock options under the 2013 Stock
Option  Plan,  with 100,000 of the options  exercisable  at a price of $1.25 per

NOTE 7. CONVERTIBLE DEBT

On January 29, 2015, the Company  entered into a securities  purchase  agreement
with a non-US  institutional  investor  whereby  it agreed to sell an  aggregate
principal  amount  of  $2,300,000  of  senior  secured  convertible  debentures,
convertible into shares of the company's common stock.

The Company received $1,800,000 of the funds from the transaction on February 5,
2015. The balance of $500,000 was received on May 14, 2015.

The convertible  debentures are convertible  into shares of the Company's common
stock at an initial  conversion  price of $.71 per share, for an aggregate of up
to 3,239,437  shares.  The debentures bear interest at 6% per annum. As detailed
in note 9, on September 26, 2016 the Company entered into an amendment agreement
related to these convertible debentures whereby the applicable interest rate was
increased from 6% to 8% and provisions  added to allow the investor to transfer,
sell or hypothecate the convertible notes subject to applicable securities laws.
The maturity date of the notes was also extended through September 30, 2019.

Due to the note being  convertible to the Company's  common shares, a beneficial
conversion  features  analysis  was  performed.   The  intrinsic  value  of  the
conversion  feature was $647,887 which was  recognized as debt discount.  During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016,  $147,230 of debt  discount was amortized
and the unamortized discount is $0.

As of August 31, 2016 and  November  30, 2015,  the  outstanding  balance of the
convertible  debt  is  $2,300,000  and  $2,152,770,  net of  discount  of $0 and
$147,230, respectively.

The Company analyzed the embedded  conversion  option for derivative  accounting
consideration under ASC 815-15 "Derivatives and Hedging" and determined that the
conversion option should be classified as equity.

NOTE 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

On January 22, 2015,  pursuant to a Deed of Assignment  dated effective  January
20, 2015,  the Company  entered into an Emulsion  Supply  Agreement  with Oceans
Omega  LLC  which  represents  the  rights  acquired  pursuant  to the  Deed  of
Assignment.  The  Emulsion  Supply  Agreement  provides  the  Company  with  the
non-exclusive  right and license  (without the right to sublicense) to purchase,
market,  promote,  sell and distribute  Oceans Omega LLC's omega-3 emulsions for
use in the development, production, processing, manufacture and sale of food and
beverages  (exclusive for meats) for human or animal consumption.  On January 6,
2016 the  Company  issued  3,000,000  shares to mark the  closing of the Deed of
Assignment and the Emulsion Supply  Agreement,  which did not specify the amount
of  consideration  payable by the Company when they were executed on January 20,
2015. The consideration payable was subsequently established by the parties at a
market value of  $2,700,000  based on the closing  price of the common shares as
quoted on the OTC Markets quotation systems on January 6, 2016. The value of the
license is being amortized over the remaining contractual life which is 9 years.

amortizing $200,000.

NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On September 26, 2016, the Company entered into a securities  purchase agreement
with a non-US  institutional  investor,  pursuant to which, in consideration for
proceeds of $4,100,000, the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note
in the amount of $4,100,000.  Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the
investor has agreed, from time to time after January 1, 2017, to make additional
investments  at the Company's  request of up to $5,900,000  ($10,000,000  in the
aggregate)  in one or more  tranches of not less than one tranche  during any 60
day period. The funding of any tranche under the agreement (other than the first
$4,100,000  which has been  funded) is subject  to the mutual  agreement  of the
parties as to the use of funds.  The parties  have agreed to  negotiate  in good
faith to pre-approve use of funds with 120 days following September 26, 2016.

The Company  intends to use the  proceeds of the  secured  convertible  note for
general working capital purposes including,  without  limitation,  settlement of
accounts payable and repayment of mature loans.

In consideration of each advance made by the investor pursuant to the securities
purchase  agreement,  the  Company  will  issue to the  investor  a  convertible
promissory note of equal value, maturing three years after issuance, and bearing
interest  at the  rate of 8% per  annum.  Each  note  will be  secured  in first
priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company,  and will
be  convertible  in whole or in part at the  option of the  holder  into  common
shares of the Company at a price per share equal to a 25% discount to the 10 day
average closing price of the Company's  common stock for the period  immediately
preceding the issuance of the applicable note.

As additional  consideration  to the investor for entering  into the  securities
purchase agreement, the Company concurrently entered into an amendment agreement
pursuant to which certain  features of convertible  promissory  notes previously
purchased by the investor in the original  principal amounts of US$1,800,000 and
US$500,000,  on January 29, 2015 and May 14, 2015,  respectively,  were amended.
The amendments  raise the applicable  interest rate from 6% to 8% per annum, and
allow the investor to transfer,  sell,  or  hypothecate  the  convertible  notes
subject to applicable  securities  laws. The maturity date of the notes was also
extended through September 30, 2019.

intention of Trident Brands Inc. and Continental Ingredients Canada Inc. ("CIC")
to enter into negotiations  regarding the potential acquisition by Trident of up
to 43% of the voting  securities of CIC with an option to acquire the balance of
all  remaining  issued  and  outstanding  voting  securities  at the time of the

to the  agreement  can assign its  interests  or  obligations  without the prior
written  consent  of the other  party,  a change of  control in CIC shall not be
considered an assignment of CIC's rights and obligations.

at our request of up to $5,900,000 ($10,000,000 in the aggregate) in one or more
tranches of not less than one tranche  during any 60 day period.  The funding of
any tranche under the agreement  (other than the first $4,100,000 which has been
funded)  is  subject to the  mutual  agreement  of the  parties as to the use of

                                       16
 
funds.  The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to pre-approve use of

including,  without limitation,  settlement of accounts payable and repayment of
mature loans. In consideration of each advance made by the investor  pursuant to
the Securities Purchase  Agreement,  we will issue to the investor a convertible
promissory note of equal value, maturing three years after issuance, and bearing
interest  at the  rate of 8% per  annum.  Each  note  will be  secured  in first
priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company,  and will

offerings and realized  increased  sales of Brain  Armor(R),  primarily  through
e-retailers.  Gross Profit increased accordingly in the third quarter of 2016 to
$7,640 or 44.9% of  revenues  versus  $4,186 or 42.2% of  revenues  in the prior
year,  indicative of increased  efficiencies and an improved product mix. During
the quarter we incurred  continued  manufacturing  delays on the  production  of
certain Everlast(R) products,  resulting in reduced revenues in the quarter, and
it is expected that this will also have an impact on Everlast(R) revenues in the
fourth quarter as well.  Even so, we expect both  Everlast(R) and Brain Armor(R)
revenues  to  continue  to  ramp-up  over the  course  of 2016 and into  2017 as
commercial efforts gain traction,  new listings are realized and further product
innovation is brought to the market.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Our  operating  expenses for the three month  periods  ended August 31, 2016 and

Operating  expenses  for the three  month  period  ended  August  31,  2016 were
$422,072 as compared to $462,214 for the comparative  period in 2015, a decrease
of approximately 9%. The decrease in our operating expenses was primarily due to
reduced  marketing  and  promotional  expenses  based on the  timing of  certain
expenditures  in the  prior  year,  a focused  effort  in 2016 to delay  certain
marketing and selling  costs as a result of  manufacturing  issues  delaying the
roll-out of the new  Everlast  Nutrition  SKU's and reduced  professional  fees,
offset by increased general and administrative  costs including  advertising and
promotion,  as we build-out our organization and roll-out our product offerings,
as  well  as  incremental   non-cash  costs  of  $55,258  due  to  stock  option
compensation  expense and  amortization  of a license  acquired during the first
quarter of 2016. Operating costs are expected to continue to increase throughout
2016 and into 2017 as we  continue  to develop  and  commercialize  our  product
offerings.

OTHER EXPENSES

Other  expenses for the three month  period  ended August 31, 2016  decreased to
$159,856 versus $263,855 in the comparative period in 2015. The decrease was due
to the  reduction  in  interest  expense  related to the  beneficial  conversion
feature on the convertible debt offset by an increase in interest expense due to
higher  debt  levels  plus an  increase  in  royalties  as per the  terms of the
Everlast(R) License Agreement.

NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 AND AUGUST 31, 2015

Our  operating  results  for the nine month  periods  ended  August 31, 2016 and
August 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:

                                       18
 
REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS

While still in the early stages of commercialization,  our revenues increased in
the first  nine  months of 2016 as we have  commenced  commercialization  of our
product  offerings and realized  increased  sales of both  Everlast(R) and Brain
Armor(R)  product lines,  primarily  through  retailers.  Gross Profit increased
accordingly in the third quarter of 2016 to $105,689 or 43.8% of revenues versus
$5,288 or 45.8% of  revenues  in the prior  year.  During  the  second and third
quarters  we  incurred   manufacturing  delays  on  the  production  of  certain
Everlast(R) products, resulting in reduced revenues in those quarters, and it is
expected  that this will also  have an  impact on  Everlast(R)  revenues  in the
fourth quarter as well.  Even so, we expect both  Everlast(R) and Brain Armor(R)
revenues  to  continue  to  ramp-up  over the  course  of 2016 and into  2017 as
commercial efforts gain traction,  new listings are realized and further product
innovation is brought to the market.

Operating  expenses  for the nine  month  period  ended  August  31,  2016  were
$1,522,060  as compared to  $1,282,750  for the  comparative  period in 2015, an
increase  of  approximately  19%.  The  increase  in our  operating  expenses is
primarily due to increased general and administrative  costs as we build out our
organization and roll-out our product offerings, as well as incremental non-cash
costs of $101,565  due to stock  option  compensation  expense and  amortization
costs of  $200,000  related to a license  acquired  during the first  quarter of
2016.  Operating costs are expected to continue to increase  throughout 2016 and
into 2017 as we continue to develop and commercialize our product offerings.

OTHER EXPENSES

Other  expenses for the nine month  period  ended  August 31, 2016  decreased to
$585,067 versus $628,116 in the comparative period in 2015. The decrease was due
to the  reduction  in  interest  expense  related to the  beneficial  conversion
feature on the convertible debt offset by an increase in interest expense due to
higher  debt  levels  plus an  increase  in  royalties  as per the  terms of the
Everlast(R) License Agreement.

BALANCE SHEET DATA

The following table provides selected balance sheet as at August 31, 2016.

                                       19
 
During the first three quarters of 2016 total assets increased significantly due
to the value of the license agreement for the rights to purchase,  market,  sell
and  distribute  certain  Omega  3  emulsions  produced  by  Oceans  Omega  LLC.
Stockholders equity also increased as this license was acquired for shares, thus
increasing the Additional Paid in Capital.

STRATEGIC ORIENTATION

Our  objective  is to  provide  our  shareholders  with  solid  returns  through
strategic  investments  across  multiple  consumer  product and food  ingredient
platforms. The platforms we are focusing on include:

     *    Life science  technologies and related products that have applications
          to a range of consumer products;
     *    Nutritional  supplements and related consumer goods providing  defined
          benefits to the consumer; and
     *    Functional  foods and beverages  ingredients  with defined  health and
          wellness benefits.

We are building our business through strategic  investments in high growth early
stage   consumer   brands   and   functional    ingredients   platforms   within
segment/sectors  which we  believe  offer  long term  growth  potential.  We are
focused on three core strategies underpinning our objectives:

     *    To execute  our  multi-tier  brand and  innovation  strategy  to drive
          revenue;
     *    To  aggressively  manage our asset light business model to drive a low
          cost platform; and
     *    To drive  disciplines  leading to  increased  investor  awareness  and
          ability to finance and govern growing operations.

While we have yet to realize break even cash flows or profitability,  we believe
we are making progress against our goals and objectives, and expect revenues and
margins  to  increase  as we  begin  commercializing  the  products  within  our
portfolio.  All three of our  product  platforms  show  solid  potential  in the
markets where they compete and both our Everlast(R)  and Brain Armor(R)  product
lines are now in the market and generating  revenues.  Our strategy was to first
establish  listings for these products with non-bricks and mortar accounts,  and
this has been  successful.  Brain Armor(R) has now been listed at a large retail
account  as  well,  and we  expect  listings  for  Everlast(R)  to  follow.  The
development of Oceans Omega as an ingredient  for food and beverage  products is
ongoing, and given the longer sales cycle for ingredients,  we expect to realize
revenues later in fiscal 2106 both through external customer product development
and also  internally via potential line  extensions for both the Everlast(R) and
Brain Armor(R) product lines.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash balance at August 31, 2016 was $ 4,484 with $ 4,736,704 in  outstanding
liabilities  including loans payable and convertible debt. On September 26, 2016
we  received  proceeds of  $4,100,000  through  the  issuance of senior  secured
convertible debentures.

As at August 31, 2016 we had two loans payable to a related party (CIC), one for
$180,000  bearing  interest at a rate of 8% per annum,  due November 2, 2016 and
the other one for $200,000 at a rate of 10%, due March 4, 2017. As at August 31,
2016, the full amount of the loans and interest were  outstanding.  The loan for
$180,000 plus outstanding interest was repaid in full on September 27, 2016.

As at August 31, 216, we had three short term loans from third parties.  One for
$200,000,  one for $100,000 and the other for $250,000  bearing  interest at the
rate of 8.0%,  8.0% and 10.0%  per  annum  respectively,  payable  on  maturity,
calculated on the  principle  amount of the loan  outstanding.  As at August 31,
2016, the full amount of the loans and interest were outstanding.  The loans for
$200,000 and $250,000 plus outstanding interest were repaid in full on September
29, 2016. The loan for $100,000 plus outstanding  interest was repaid in full on
October 4, 2016.

On January 29,  2015,  we entered into a securities  purchase  agreement  with a
non-US  institutional  investor whereby we agreed to sell an aggregate principal
amount of $2,300,000 of senior secured convertible debentures,  convertible into

                                       20
 
shares of the company's  common stock. We received  $1,800,000 of the funds from
the transaction on February 5, 2015 and the balance of $500,000 on May 14, 2015.
On September 26, 2016, we entered into a Convertible  Promissory  Note Amendment
Agreement  with this investor  whereby we agreed to extend the maturity date and
amend the interest payable on the senior secured convertible debentures, whereby
we extended the term of the notes  through  September 30, 2019 and interest rate
was increased from 6% per annum to 8% per annum. The convertible  debentures are
convertible into shares of the Company's  common stock at an initial  conversion
price of $.71 per share for an aggregate of up to 3,239,437 shares.

On January 29, 2016 and February 29, 2016, we entered into  Securities  Purchase
Agreements  whereby we  received  proceeds  of  $250,000 on February 3, 2016 and
$200,000 on March 4, 2016 in return for secured promissory notes of $250,000 and
$200,000 due 12 months from the issuance date,  bearing  interest at the rate of
10% per annum,  and 125,000 and 100,00 warrants  respectively to purchase common
shares of our  Company at an  exercise  price of $1.35 per share for three years
from  the date of  issue.  The  promissory  note and  outstanding  interest  for
$250,000 was repaid in full on September 29, 2016. The $200,000  promissory note
(due to a related party,  as disclosed  previously)  remains  outstanding and is
subordinate to the senior secured convertible debentures.

On September 26, 2016, we entered into a Securities  Purchase  Agreement  with a
non-US  institutional  investor pursuant to which, in consideration for proceeds
of $4,100,000,  we issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of
$4,100,000.  Pursuant to the  Securities  Purchase  Agreement,  the investor has
agreed, from time to time after January 1, 2017, to make additional  investments
at our request of up to $5,900,000 ($10,000,000 in the aggregate) in one or more
tranches of not less than one tranche  during any 60 day period.  The funding of
any tranche under the agreement  (other than the first $4,100,000 which has been
funded)  is  subject to the  mutual  agreement  of the  parties as to the use of
funds.  The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to pre-approve use of
funds  within  120 days  following  September  26,  2016.  We  intend to use the
proceeds of the secured  convertible  note for general working capital  purposes
including,  without limitation,  settlement of accounts payable and repayment of
mature loans. In consideration of each advance made by the investor  pursuant to
the Securities Purchase  Agreement,  we will issue to the investor a convertible
promissory note of equal value, maturing three years after issuance, and bearing
interest  at the  rate of 8% per  annum.  Each  note  will be  secured  in first
priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company,  and will
be  convertible  in whole or in part at the  option of the  holder  into  common
shares of the Company at a price per share equal to a 25% discount to the 10 day
average closing price of the Company's  common stock for the period  immediately
preceding the issuance of the applicable note.

Going  forward we will need to  continue to raise funds via both debt and equity
offerings to support the anticipated growth of our business. While funds on hand
are likely not  sufficient to fund our  operations  for the next twelve  months,
management  are  actively   assessing  and  developing  a  number  of  financing
alternatives  to raise funds as  required  in addition  the amounts to be funded
under  the  September  26,  2016  Securities  Purchase  Agreement  with a non-US
institutional investor.

Required funds may be raised through equity financing,  debt financing, or other
sources,  some of which may lead to  dilution  in the  equity  ownership  of our
shares.  Without  these  funds,  there is no  assurance  that we will be able to
maintain  operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on
their investment in our common stock.

GOING CONCERN

The accompanying  financial  statements included in this Form 10-Q are presented
on a going  concern  basis.  There is  substantial  doubt  about our  ability to
continue as a going concern.

As shown in the accompanying  financial statements,  we have incurred net losses
of $5,790,925 since inception. This condition raises substantial doubt as to our
ability to continue as a going concern. In response to these conditions,  we may
raise  additional  capital  through  the sale of equity  securities,  through an
offering of debt securities or through borrowings from financial institutions or
individuals.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

                                       21
 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not have any off-balance  sheet  arrangements  that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial  condition,  revenues or expenses,  results of operations,  liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Except for the transactions noted in Business  Developments,  there have been no
material  changes  outside  the normal  course of  business  in our  contractual
obligations since November 30, 2015.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make certain  estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and disclosure
of gain and loss  contingencies  at the date of the  financial  statements.  The
estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based
on  historical  experience  and  various  other  factors  that we  believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information that
forms  the  basis of our  estimates  and  assumptions  as our  business  and the
business  environment  generally  changes.  The use of  estimates  is  pervasive
throughout our financial statements.  There have been no material changes to the
critical accounting  estimates disclosed under the heading "Critical  Accounting
Estimates"  in  Item 7,  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations", of the Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide this information.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the  participation  of our management,  including
our principal  executive officer and the principal  financial  officer,  we have
conducted an evaluation of the  effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the  Securities  and  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as of the end of the  period
covered  by this  report.  Based on this  evaluation,  our  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the material
information  required to be included in our Securities  and Exchange  Commission
reports  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to our  management,  including  our
principal executive and financial officer, recorded,  processed,  summarized and
reported  within the time periods  specified in SEC rules and forms  relating to
our company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management,  with the  participation of our principal  executive officer and
principal  financial  officer have  concluded that there have been no changes in
our internal  control over  financial  reporting  that occurred  during the last
fiscal  quarter  ended  August 31, 2016 that have  materially  affected,  or are
reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  our internal  control over  financial
reporting.

I, Donald MacPhee, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this Report on Form 10-Q of Trident Brands Incorporated;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial

     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer  and  I are  responsible  for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))  and internal  control over
     financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and
     15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

     a)   Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;
     b)   Designed such internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or caused
          such internal  control over  financial  reporting to be designed under
          our  supervision,   to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
          reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;
     c)   Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
     d)   Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's  fourth fiscal quarter in
          the case of an annual  report)  that has  materially  affected,  or is
          reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's  other certifying  officer and I have disclosed,  based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
     b)   Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
