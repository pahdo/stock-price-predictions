1    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Organization    

Cleantech
Solutions International, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on June 24, 1987 under the name of Malex,
Inc. On December 18, 2007, the Company s corporate name was changed to China Wind Systems, Inc., and on June 13, 2011, the
Company s corporate name was changed to Cleantech Solutions International, Inc. On August 7, 2012, the Company was converted
into a Nevada corporation.  

Through
its affiliated companies and subsidiaries, the Company manufactures and sells textile dyeing and finishing machines and sells
forged products and fabricated products to a range of clean technology customers including high precision forged rolled rings
and related components for the wind power industry and other industries. The Company is the sole owner of Fulland Limited ( Fulland ),
a Cayman Island limited liability company, which was organized on May 9, 2007. Fulland owns 100% of the capital stock of Green
Power Environment Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. ( Green Power ) and Wuxi Fulland Wind Energy Equipment Co., Ltd.
( Fulland Wind Energy ), which are wholly foreign-owned enterprises ( WFOE ) organized under the laws
of the People s Republic of China ( PRC  or  China ). Green Power is a party to a series of contractual
arrangements, as fully described below, dated October 12, 2007 with Wuxi Huayang Heavy Industries, Co., Ltd. ( Heavy Industries ),
formerly known as Wuxi Huayang Electrical Power Equipment Co., Ltd., and Wuxi Huayang Dyeing Machinery Co., Ltd. ( Dyeing ),
both of which are limited liability companies organized under the laws of, and based in, the PRC. Heavy Industries and Dyeing
are sometimes collectively referred to as the  Huayang Companies   .  

Fulland
was organized by the owners of the Huayang Companies as a special purpose vehicle for purposes of raising capital in accordance
with requirements of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ). On May 31, 2007, SAFE issued an official
notice known as Hui Zong Fa [2007] No. 106 ( Circular 106 ), which requires the owners of any Chinese company to obtain
SAFE s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition
matters in China. Accordingly, the owners of the Huayang Companies, Mr. Jianhua Wu and Ms. Lihua Tang, submitted their application
to SAFE in early September 2007. On October 11, 2007, SAFE approved their application, permitting these Chinese citizens to establish
Fulland as a special purpose vehicle for any foreign ownership and capital raising activities by the Huayang Companies.  

Dyeing,
which was formed on August 17, 1995, produces and sells a variety of high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery for
the textile industry. The Company refers to this segment as the dyeing and finishing equipment segment  .  

Fulland
Wind Energy was formed on August 27, 2008. In 2009, the Company began to produce and sell forged products through Fulland Wind
Energy. Through Fulland Wind Energy, the Company manufactures and machines all forged products, including wind products such as
shafts, rolled rings, gear rims, gearboxes, bearings and other components and finished products and assemblies for the wind power
and other industries, including large-scale equipment used in the manufacturing process for the various industries. The Company
refers to this segment of its business as the forged rolled rings and related components segment  .  

Beginning
in February 2015, Heavy Industries began to produce equipment for the petroleum and chemical industries, and it produces and sells
a variety of heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers, cryogenic equipment, and other products. The Company refers to this segment
of its business as the petroleum and chemical equipment segment  .  

Basis
of presentation; management s responsibility for preparation of financial statements   

The
Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Fulland, Green Power and Fulland Wind Energy, as well as the financial statements of Huayang Companies - Dyeing and Heavy Industries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation  .  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and footnotes
thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. The consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015 contained herein has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of December
31, 2015, but does not include all disclosures required by the U.S. GAAP.

1    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   

Basis
of presentation; management s responsibility for preparation of financial statements (continued)   

Pursuant
to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810, the Huayang Companies are considered variable interest entities
( VIE ), and the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company s relationships with the Huayang Companies
and their shareholders are governed by a series of contractual arrangements between Green Power, the Company s wholly foreign-owned
enterprise in the PRC, and each of the Huayang Companies, which are the operating companies of the Company in the PRC. Under PRC
laws, each of Green Power, Dyeing and Heavy Industries is an independent legal entity and none of them is exposed to liabilities
incurred by the other parties. The contractual arrangements constitute valid and binding obligations of the parties of such agreements.
Each of the contractual arrangements and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are enforceable and valid in accordance
with the laws of the PRC. On October 12, 2007, the Company entered into the following contractual arrangements with each of Dyeing
and Heavy Industries  :  

Consulting
Services Agreement . Pursuant to the exclusive consulting services agreements between Green Power and the Huayang Companies,
Green Power has the exclusive right to provide to the Huayang Companies general business operation services, including advice
and strategic planning, as well as consulting services related to the technological research and development of dyeing and finishing
machines, electrical equipment and related components (the  Services ). Under this agreement, Green Power owns the
intellectual property rights developed or discovered through research and development, in the course of providing the Services,
or derived from the provision of the Services. The Huayang Companies shall pay a quarterly consulting service fees in Renminbi
( RMB ) to Fulland that is equal to all of the Huayang Companies  profits for such quarter  .  

Operating
Agreement . Pursuant to the operating agreement among Green Power, the Huayang Companies and the two shareholders of the Huayang
Companies, Green Power provides guidance and instructions on the Huayang Companies  daily operations, financial management
and employment issues. The Huayang Companies  shareholders must designate the candidates recommended by Green Power as their
representatives on the boards of directors of each of the Huayang Companies. Green Power has the right to appoint senior executives
of the Huayang Companies. In addition, Green Power agrees to guarantee the Huayang Companies  performance under any agreements
or arrangements relating to the Huayang Companies  business arrangements with any third party. The Huayang Companies, in
return, agree to pledge their accounts receivable and all of their assets to Green Power. Moreover, each of the Huayang Companies
agrees that, without the prior consent of Green Power, it will not engage in any transactions that could materially affect its
assets, liabilities, rights or operations, including, without limitation, incurrence or assumption of any indebtedness, sale or
purchase of any assets or rights, incurrence of any encumbrance on any of their assets or intellectual property rights in favor
of a third party or transfer of any agreements relating to their business operation to any third party. The term of this agreement,
as amended on November 1, 2008, is 20 years from October 12, 2007 and may be extended only upon Green Power s written confirmation
prior to the expiration of the this agreement, with the extended term to be mutually agreed upon by the parties  .  

Equity
Pledge Agreement.   Under the equity pledge agreement between the Huayang Companies  shareholders and Green
Power, the Huayang Companies  shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in the Huayang Companies to Green Power
to guarantee the Huayang Companies  performance of their respective obligations under the consulting services agreement.
If the Huayang Companies or the Huayang Companies  shareholders breach their respective contractual obligations, Green Power,
as pledgee, will be entitled to certain rights, including the right to sell the pledged equity interests. The Huayang Companies 
shareholders also agreed that, upon occurrence of any event of default, Green Power shall be granted an exclusive, irrevocable
power of attorney to take actions in the place and stead of the Huayang Companies  shareholders to carry out the security
provisions of the equity pledge agreement and take any action and execute any instrument that Green Power may deem necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purposes of the equity pledge agreement. The Huayang Companies  shareholders agreed not to dispose
of the pledged equity interests or take any actions that would prejudice Green Power s interest. The equity pledge agreement
will expire two years after the Huayang Companies  obligations under the consulting services agreements have been fulfilled  .  

Option
Agreement.    Under the option agreement between the Huayang Companies  shareholders and Green Power,
the Huayang Companies  shareholders irrevocably granted Green Power or its designated person an exclusive option to purchase,
to the extent permitted under PRC law, all or part of the equity interests in the Huayang Companies for the cost of the initial
contributions to the registered capital or the minimum amount of consideration permitted by applicable PRC law. Green Power or
its designated person has sole discretion to decide when to exercise the option, whether in part or in full. The term of this
agreement, as amended on November 1, 2008, is 20 years from October 12, 2007 and may be extended prior to its expiration by written
agreement of the parties  .

NOTE
1    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   

Basis
of presentation; management s responsibility for preparation of financial statements (continued)   

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, the accounts of the Huayang
Companies are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As VIEs, the Huayang Companies  sales are included
in the Company s total sales, its (loss) income from operations is consolidated with the Company s, and the Company s
net (loss) income includes all of the Huayang Companies net (loss) income. The Company does not have any non-controlling interest
and, accordingly, did not subtract any net (loss) income in calculating the net (loss) income of the VIEs that is attributable
to the Company. Because of the contractual arrangements, the Company has a pecuniary interest in the Huayang Companies that requires
consolidation of the Company s and the Huayang Companies  financial statements.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results
could materially differ from these estimates. Significant estimates in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the allowance for obsolete inventory, the useful life of property and equipment
and intangible assets, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets and valuation of deferred tax assets, accruals
for taxes due, and the value of stock-based compensation. Because of the significant decline in revenues from the forged rolled
rings and related components and petroleum equipment segments, the Company is evaluating on an ongoing basic, the continuation
of these segments. In the event that the Company discontinues either or both of these segments, the Company may suffer an impairment
expense with respect to the assets dedicated to those segments.  

Cash
and cash equivalents    

For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity
of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains with various financial institutions
mainly in the PRC and the U.S. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash balances held in PRC and PRC banks of $11,909,903
and $18,777,228, respectively, are uninsured. The funds are primarily held in banks  .  

Fair
value of financial instruments and other assets   

The
Company adopted the guidance of ASC Topic 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes
methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as
follows  :  

Level
1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date  .  

Level
2 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data  .  

Level
3 - Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information  .  

The
following table presents information about equipment held for sale measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The
Company conducted an impairment assessment on the equipment held for sale based on the guidelines established in ASC Topic 360
to determine the estimated fair market value of the equipment held for sale as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Upon
completion of its 2015 impairment analysis, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on the
equipment held for sale. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0 and $417,171 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable,
accounts receivable, inventories, advances to suppliers, deferred tax assets, prepaid expenses and other, short-term bank loans,
bank acceptance notes payable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, advances from customers, VAT and service taxes payable and
income taxes payable approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments  .  

ASC
Topic 825-10  Financial Instruments  allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and
liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is
irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses
for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair
value option to any outstanding instruments  .  

Concentrations
of credit risk   

The
Company s operations are carried out in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC s
economy. The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically
associated with companies in North America. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies
with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods
of taxation, among other things  .  

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts
receivable. Substantially all of the Company s cash is maintained with state-owned banks within the PRC, and none of these
deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed
to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. A significant portion of the Company s sales are credit sales which are primarily
to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, concentrations
of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk  .  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s cash balances by geographic area were as follows  :  

Restricted
cash    

Restricted
cash mainly consists of cash deposits held by various banks to secure bank acceptance notes payable. The Company s restricted
cash totaled $266,388 and $647,080 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Notes
receivable   

Notes
receivable represents trade accounts receivable due from customers where the customers  bank has guaranteed the payment
of the receivable. This amount is non-interest bearing and is normally paid within six months. Historically, the Company has experienced
no losses on notes receivable. The Company s notes receivable totaled $115,453 and $132,497 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.   

Accounts
receivable   

Accounts
receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when
there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances,
the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer s historical payment history, its current
credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, accounts with the amount of approximately $1,737,000 and $6,000, respectively, were
written off after exhaustive efforts at collection with a corresponding debit to the allowance for doubtful account. The write-offs
of accounts receivable against the allowance for doubtful accounts only impact the balance sheet accounts. At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding balances, an allowance for doubtful accounts
in the amounts of $1,418,994 and $3,218,592, respectively.   

Inventories   

Inventories,
consisting of raw materials, work in process and finished goods related to the Company s products are stated at the lower
of cost or market utilizing the weighted average method. A reserve is established when management determines that certain inventories
may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand,
the Company will record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on
estimates. The Company recorded an inventory reserve of $1,064,035 and $1,093,326 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively  .  

Advances
to suppliers   

Advances
to suppliers represent the cash paid in advance for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended
to ensure preferential pricing and delivery. The amounts advanced under such arrangements totaled $1,028,939 and $1,038,884 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Equipment
held for sale   

Long-lived
assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met. These criteria include: management s commitment to
a plan to sell the assets; the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition; an active program to
locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets has been initiated; the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year; the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in
relation to their fair value; and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets. We measure
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less associated costs to sell. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company reflected certain manufacturing equipment that was previously used in forged rolled rings and
related components segment and petroleum and chemical equipment segment as equipment held for sale on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.  

Property
and equipment   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets
are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in the statements of operations in the year of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in
the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable  .

Impairment
of long-lived assets   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an
impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value  . The
Company did not record any impairment charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Advances
from customers     

Advances
from customers at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $408,956 and $433,050, respectively, and consist of prepayments
from customers for merchandise that had not yet been shipped. The Company will recognize the deposits as revenue as customers
take delivery of the goods and title to the assets is transferred to customers in accordance with the Company s revenue
recognition policy.  

Revenue
recognition   

Pursuant
to the guidance of ASC Topic 605 and ASC Topic 360, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured  .  

The
Company recognizes revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and other components, petroleum
and chemical equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year
warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized
when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days
of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and
generally is recognized over the contract period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounts allocated to
installation and warranty revenues were $18,679 and $18,146, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
amounts allocated to installation and warranty revenues were $56,555 and $61,032, respectively. Based on historical experience,
warranty service calls and any related labor costs have been minimal  .  

All
other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions, including the forged rolled rings, are recognized upon customer
acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery
based on the trade terms  .  

Income
taxes   

The
Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company accounts
for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence,
it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,  which provides clarification
related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in the Company s financial statements.
Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of
the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income
taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period
based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future  .

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC Topic 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director
services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award  .  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense based on the fair
value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued, or the total compensation
is recalculated, based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date  .  

Shipping
costs   

Shipping
costs are included in selling expenses and totaled $28,609 and $174,497 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Shipping costs totaled $95,087 and $804,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Employee
benefits   

The
Company s operations and employees are all located in the PRC. The Company makes mandatory contributions to the PRC government s
health, retirement benefit and unemployment funds in accordance with the relevant Chinese social security laws. The costs of these
payments are charged to the same accounts as the related salary costs in the same period as the related salary costs incurred.
Employee benefit costs totaled $40,645 and $51,360 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Employee
benefit costs totaled $131,885 and $174,738 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Advertising   

Advertising

expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Advertising expenses totaled $10,628 and $29,731 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.     

Research
and development   

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. The costs primarily consist of raw materials and salaries incurred for the development
and improvement of the Company s new dyeing machinery. Research and development costs totaled $111,840 and $23,935 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development costs totaled $196,478 and $81,195
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  .   

Foreign
currency translation   

The
reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the parent company is the U.S. dollar and the
functional currency of the Company s operating subsidiaries is the Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ). For the subsidiaries
and affiliates, whose functional currencies are the RMB, results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange
rates during the period, assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period, and equity
is translated at historical exchange rates. As a result, amounts relating to assets and liabilities reported on the statements
of cash flows may not necessarily agree with the changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets. Translation adjustments
resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining
comprehensive (loss) income. The cumulative translation adjustment and effect of exchange rate changes on cash for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(430,689) and $(615,575), respectively. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred  .

All
of the Company s revenue transactions are transacted in the functional currency of the operating subsidiaries and affiliates.
Other than for the purchase of equipment from non-Chinese suppliers, the Company does not enter into any material transaction
in foreign currencies. Transaction gains or losses have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on the results
of operations of the Company  .  

Asset

$1.00, respectively, which were the exchange rates on the balance sheet dates. Equity accounts were stated at their historical
rate. The average translation rates applied to the statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were 6.57924 RMB and 6.1606 RMB to $1.00, respectively. Cash flows from the Company s operations are calculated based upon
the local currencies using the average translation rate  .  

(Loss)
income per share of common stock   

ASC
Topic 260  Earnings per Share,  requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS )
with a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes dilution. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
then shared in the earnings of the entity  .  

Basic
net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net
(loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities
outstanding during each period. The Company did not have any common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following table presents a reconciliation of basic and
diluted net (loss) income per share  :   

Related
parties   

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The
Company discloses all related party transactions.   

Comprehensive
loss   

Comprehensive
loss is comprised of net (loss) income and all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except those due to investments
by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. For the Company, comprehensive loss for the three

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the
classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt

NOTE
13    STATUTORY RESERVE   

The
Company is required to make appropriations to statutory reserve, based on after-tax net income determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles of the PRC (the  PRC GAAP ). Appropriation to the statutory reserve should be at least
10% of the after tax net income determined in accordance with the PRC GAAP until the reserve is equal to 50% of the entities 
registered capital or members  equity. As of December 31, 2015, the Company appropriated the required maximum 50% of its
registered capital to statutory reserve for Dyeing and Heavy Industries; accordingly, no additional statutory reserve is required
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not appropriated the required
maximum 50% of its registered capital to statutory reserve for Fulland Wind Energy. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company did not make any appropriations to statutory reserve for Fulland Wind Energy as it incurred recurring net
loss  .

14    SEGMENT INFORMATION   

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company operated in three reportable business segments - (1)
the manufacture of textile dyeing and finishing equipment segment, (2) the manufacture of forged rolled rings and related components
segment, and (3) the manufacture of petroleum and chemical equipment segment. The Company s reportable segments are strategic
business units that offer different products. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations.
All of the Company s operations are conducted in the PRC.   Because
of the significant decline in revenues from the forged rolled rings and related components and petroleum equipment segments, the
Company is evaluating, on an ongoing basic, the continuation of these two segments. In the event that the Company discontinues
either or both of these segments, the Company may suffer an impairment expense with respect to the assets dedicated to those segments.
Information with respect to these reportable business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was as follows:  

(a)    The
                                         Company does not allocate any general and administrative expense of its U.S. activities
                                         to its reportable segments, because these activities are managed at a corporate level.

NOTE
16    RESTRICTED NET ASSETS    

Regulations
in the PRC permit payments of dividends by the Company s PRC VIEs only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Subject to certain cumulative limit, a statutory reserve fund requires
annual appropriations of at least 10% of after-tax profit, if any, of the relevant PRC VIE s and subsidiary. Heavy Industries
and Dyeing had reached the cumulative limit as of December 31, 2015. The statutory reserve funds are not distributable as cash
dividends. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the Company s PRC VIE s and its subsidiary are restricted
in their abilities to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company. Foreign exchange and other regulations in PRC may
further restrict the Company s PRC VIEs and its subsidiaries from transferring funds to the Company in the form of loans
and/or advances  .  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, substantially all of the Company s net assets are attributable to the PRC VIE s
and its subsidiaries located in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s restricted net assets at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were approximately $76,236,000 and $79,627,000, respectively  .

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Overview   

Historically
 we were engaged in two business segments   the dyeing and finishing equipment segment,
in which we manufacture and sell textile dyeing and finishing machines, and the forged rolled rings and related components segment,
in which we manufacture and sell high precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components. As a result
of a significant decline in revenues in the forged rolled rings and related components segment, revenue from the dyeing and finishing
segment represented 99.2% of our revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 95.6% of our revenue in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016.   

In
2015, we entered a third segment, the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufactured and sold equipment, such
as reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers and other components, to the petroleum and chemical industries.
Sales in this segment commenced in the first quarter of 2015. However, we had no revenue from this segment since the second quarter
of 2016 and nominal revenue from this segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our largest customer in 2015, which
was a customer of this segment, alleged breach of contract by us and demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price
plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of RMB 36,103,640 ($5,562,365 at December 31, 2015). In the third
quarter of 2016, the claimed sale contract dispute was resolved, and we made a payment of RMB 36,103,640 to this customer in full
satisfaction of the customer s claims against us. We are no longer selling products to this customer and we have not been
able to generate business in this segment from other customers.  

The
following table sets forth information as to revenues of our dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and related components,
and petroleum and chemical equipment segments in dollars and as a percent of revenues (dollars in thousands):  

Recently,
difficult economic conditions, a continuing decline in oil prices and limited availability of credit in China, presented numerous
challenges for our business. In our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission
airflow dyeing machines as many of our potential customers already upgraded to newer models and we believe that much of our remaining
potential customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. Our forged rolled rings
and related products segment and petroleum and chemical equipment segment in particular experienced significant reduction in sales
and operated at a loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with no revenue from the petroleum and chemical equipment
segment and nominal revenue from the forged rolled rings and related components segment in the third quarter of 2016  .  

The
key factors that affected our revenue, gross margin and net income (loss) in our segments during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, including the factors which resulted in significant declines in revenues in all of our three segments, particularly
in our forged rolled rings and related components segment and petroleum and chemical equipment segment. Our ability to expand
our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government s policy on such matters as the availability
of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to alternative energy such as wind power, which affect
our products for these industries. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that
we will be able to increase our revenues in any segment in the near future, if at all. Because of the nature of our products,
our customers  projection of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase
capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date. Further, our petroleum and chemical equipment segment
was impacted by the loss of our major customer in that segment following the December 2015 contract termination by our largest
customer alleging breach of contract for late delivery and for delivery of product with quality defects and the related write-offs
at December 31, 2015  . Because this customer is
a major company in the petroleum and chemical industry, its claim against us for breach of contract, including the claim that
our products had quality defects, makes it more difficult to sell products in this segment.  

The
Future of the Forged Rolled Rings and Petroleum and Chemical Segments   

In
view of the sharp decline in revenue from both the forged rolled rings and related products and the petroleum and chemical equipment
segments and the lack of any revenue in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, including the loss of our major customer,
which was a customer in the petroleum and chemical segment, the negative gross margin for the forged rolled rings and related
components segment, and our anticipation that sales in the forged rolled rings and related products will continue to decline from
their current low levels and the absence of any orders for our petroleum and chemical equipment segment during 2016 through the
date of this report, we are evaluating, on an ongoing basis, the viability of these segments, and, if we determine that it is
not likely that we will be able to operate either or both of these segments profitably, we may discontinue operating in either
or both of these segments and seek to sell the associated assets. We are not optimistic about the market for either our forged
rolled rings and related products or our petroleum and chemical products. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to
improve our revenues from these segments in the near future, if at all, and it may be necessary for us to discontinue operating
in one or both of these segments. We cannot assure you that, if we seek to sell the assets related to either or both of these
segments, that we will be able to recover the current book value of those assets. In event that we discontinue operations and
are unable to recover the current book value, it is likely that we will incur an impairment charge for equipment that is used
in these segments but which is not otherwise usable.   

Dyeing
and Finishing Equipment Segment   

Revenues
from our dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased $4.4 million, or 52.8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues from our dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased $11.1
million, or 47.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the dyeing and finishing equipment segment revenues accounted for 99.2% and 95.6%,
respectively, of our total revenues. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the challenging economic conditions
and limited availability of credit in China. In addition, our business was also affected by government actions requiring textile
manufacturers in Zhejiang province to temporarily cease operations in order to improve air quality ahead of the G20 Summit which
was scheduled for and took place in Hangzhou this September. Further, we experienced a slowdown in shipments of our low-emission
airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already replaced older dyeing equipment with new equipment,
and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines slowed down in 2016  .  

Currently,
we focus on investing in research and development to improve our competitive position. In August 2016 we purchased the technology
use right for a patent that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We believe this new patent technology will allow
us to develop next generation dyeing and finishing equipment that will appeal to textile manufacturers in China as well as Southeast
Asia. We expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its current quarterly level in
the near future, although modest declines are possible.  

Forged
Rolled Rings and Related Components Segment   

Through
our forged rolled rings and related components division, we produce precision forged rolled rings and other forged components
to the wind power and other industries. Our forged rolled rings and other related components are sold to manufacturers of industrial
equipment. Forged rolled rings and other forged components for the wind industry are used in wind turbines, which are used to
generate wind power  .  

Revenues
from our forged rolled rings and related components segment decreased $1.4 million, or 97.7%, to $32,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues from our forged rolled rings and related
components segment decreased $11.3 million, or 96.3%, to $437,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The significant decrease was mainly attributable to the reduced demand for construction
of wind power facilities, which was our principal customer base during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to the effects
of lower oil and gas prices. We expect that our revenues from forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease
in the near future. Although we are optimistic about the long-term future of the wind power industry in China, the continued difficulties
in generating revenue from this segment in the near term may make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to continue to
operate in this segment without a significant improvement in revenue, which we do not anticipate in the near future. As a result,
we may not be able to continue to operate in this business to enable us to benefit from the long-term development of wind power
in China.  

Petroleum
and Chemical Equipment Segment   

Through
our petroleum and chemical equipment division, we produce and sell equipment such as coal chemical equipment, formaldehyde plant
and downstream products, reaction kettle, heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers to petroleum and chemical industries. We
started to sell our petroleum and chemical equipment in February 2015. No revenue was generated from our petroleum and chemical
equipment segment during the third quarter of 2016, as compared with $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Revenues from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment decreased $7.5 million, or 98.3%, to $131,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Substantially all of the revenue from this segment
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were generated by our largest customer for that period which is the
customer that claimed that we breached our contract and to whom we made a payment of RMB 36,103,640 ($5,562,365 at December 31,
2015) in the third quarter of 2016 in settlement of the customer s claims against us. The market for petroleum products
is mainly dominated by three major Chinese petroleum companies, and their capital expenditure and purchasing policy have a significant
effect both upon our ability to generate revenue from this segment and the gross margins which we can generate. Furthermore, because
we sell our petroleum and chemical equipment products to a very small number of customers, the change in the purchasing policies
of one or two customers could have a significant effect on our revenues from this segment. In December 2015, we received a notice
of contract termination in writing from our largest customer, which was a customer in this segment, alleging breach of contract
for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. We did not receive any purchase order and did not
generate any revenue from this customer in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and do not expect any further revenues from
this customer. Because this former customer is a major company in the petroleum and chemical industry, its claim against us for
breach of contract, including the claim that our products had quality defects, makes it more difficult for us to sell products
in this segment. We do not anticipate any revenue from petroleum and chemical equipment segment in the near future, and we may
not be able to continue in this segment.   

Inventory
and Raw Materials   

A
major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to
price fluctuations. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in
order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing
prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also
can impair our margins. Three major suppliers provided approximately 71% of our purchases of inventories for the three months
ended September 30, 2016.  Two of these three suppliers and one other major supplier provided approximately 45% of our purchases
of inventories for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Two major suppliers provided approximately 41% of our purchases of
raw materials for the three months ended September 30, 2015. One of these two suppliers and one other major supplier provided
approximately 35% of our purchases of raw materials for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. No other supplier accounted
for 10% or more of our purchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Most of our inventory at
September 30, 2016 related to our dyeing and finishing segment  .  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates,
including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions  .

We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  .  

Variable
Interest Entities   

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include
in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs ). The accounting
standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE
or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE s residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual
arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the
primary beneficiary of the entity  .  

The
Huayang Companies are considered VIEs, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with
the Huayang Companies pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of the Huayang Companies  net income/loss. In accordance with
these agreements, the Huayang Companies shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income/loss to our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service the Huayang Companies  .  

The
accounts of the Huayang Companies are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As VIEs, the Huayang Companies sales
are included in our total sales, their income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income/loss includes all
of the Huayang Companies  net income/loss, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income/loss in calculating the
net income/loss attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in the Huayang Companies
that require consolidation of the Huayang Companies financial statements with our financial statements  .  

Accounts
Receivable   

We
have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our
existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based
on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account
balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential
for recovery is considered remote  .  

As
a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves
for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts
receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical
economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties
that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required  .  

Inventories   

Inventories,
consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the weighted
average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory
costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves
for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory
quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary.
If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is
identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are
not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted
for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements  .  

Advances
to Suppliers   

Advances
to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended
to ensure preferential pricing and delivery  .  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows  :  

Useful
    Life   
 
      Manufacturing
    equipment       
      5
      10 Years   
 
      Building
    and building improvements       
      5
      20 Years   
 
      Vehicles       
      5
    Years   
 
      Office
    equipment and furniture       
      5
    Years   

The
cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are
retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in the statements of operations in the year of disposition  .  

We
examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that
their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s
estimated fair value and its book value  .  

Land
Use Rights   

There
is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual
or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified
period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government
approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized
on the straight-line method over the land use right terms  .  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the purchase price is fixed or determinable
and collectability is reasonably assured  .  

We
recognize revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment, forged rolled rings and other components, petroleum and chemical
equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty.
Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when
the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the
delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally
is recognized over the contract period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounts allocated to
installation and warranty revenues were minimal. Based on historical experience, warranty service calls and any related labor
costs have been minimal  .  

All
other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the
parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms  .  

Income
Taxes   

We
are governed by the income tax laws of the PRC and the United States. Income taxes are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740  Accounting
for Income Taxes,  which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The charge
for taxes is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date  .  

Deferred
tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation
of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred
tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilized  .  

Deferred
tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to
equity, in which case the deferred tax is changed to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net
basis  .  

Stock-based
Compensation   

Stock
based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award. The Accounting Standards
Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on
the grant-date fair value of the award  .  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the period of services or the vesting period, whichever is applicable.
Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We record compensation expense
based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued,
or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date  .  

Currency
Exchange Rates   

Our
functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and VIEs is the RMB. All of
our sales are denominated in RMB. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect our reported levels
of revenues and profitability as the results of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. In particular,
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various
foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and RMB affect our gross
and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses  .  

Our
exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between signing
of sales contracts and settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies into RMB, the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated
at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end
of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our
statement of shareholders  equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure
to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations
and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future  .  

Our
financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our parent company. The functional currency
of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates is RMB. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation
of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our
U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of RMB against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S.
dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results  .  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements       

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the
classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt
instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance
claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must
adopt all of the amendments in the same period. We are currently evaluating the impact it may have on our consolidated financial
statements.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that
are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows or disclosures  .

The
following table sets forth information as to the revenues, gross profit (loss) and gross margin for our three business segments
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands)  .  

Revenues.   For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of approximately $4.0 million, as compared to revenues of approximately
$12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $8.0 million or 66.9%. The decrease in
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to decreases in revenue from all of our three operating
segments. The change in revenues is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of approximately $13.0 million, as compared to revenues of approximately
$42.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $29.9 million or 69.8%. The decrease in
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to decreases in revenue from all of our three operating
segments. The change in revenues is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Dyeing
and finishing equipment segment   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment decreased by approximately
$4.4 million, or 52.8%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment decreased by approximately $11.1million, or 47.3%, as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. We experienced an anticipated slowdown in sales of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines
as many customers had replaced older dyeing equipment with our low-emission airflow dyeing machine, and we believe that orders
for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines have slowed down in 2016 because the remaining potential customer base included more
companies that did not have the ability to make the significant capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their equipment. In
addition, our business was also affected by government actions requiring textile manufacturers in Zhejiang province to temporarily
cease operations in order to improve air quality ahead of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou during September 2016. Accordingly, our revenues
from dyeing and finishing equipment segment decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015 and. We expect that our revenues from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about
it s the current quarterly level in the near future, although declines are possible  .

Forged
rolled rings and related components segment   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenue from the sale of forged rolled rings and related components decreased by approximately
$1.4 million, or 97.7%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
revenue from the sale of forged rolled rings and related components decreased by approximately $11.3 million, or 96.3%, as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The continuous decline in the prices of oil and coal and the decreased availabilities
of credit, significantly affected the requirements by our customers and potential customers for our forged rolled rings and related
components. We believe that there is a degree of market saturation for our products in this segment and we expect that our revenues
from customers of forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease in the near future and we may not be able
to continue to operate in this segment.  

Petroleum
and chemical equipment segment   

We
sought to expand our business to oil and natural gas industries since 2013. We received the certifications needed to serve these
markets in mid-2013. However, we did not generate revenues or incur manufacturing costs from the petroleum and chemical segment
until the first quarter of 2015. We did not generate any revenue from petroleum and chemical equipment segment in the third quarter
of 2016, as compared with approximately $2.2 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, revenue from the sale of petroleum and chemical equipment decreased by approximately $7.5 million, or 98.3%,
to approximately $131,000 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our revenue in this segment is highly dependent
upon sales to a very small number of Chinese petrochemical companies, whose purchasing policies affect both our revenue and gross
margin for this segment, and our revenue from this segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were from
our largest customer during that period, which is the customer that claimed we breached our contract a result of late delivery
of product and to whom we made a significant payment to settle the issue during the third quarter 2016, as described above. We
did not generate any revenues from this customer in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and we do not anticipate any revenue
from our petroleum and chemical equipment segment in the near future. We may not be able to continue in this segment.  

Cost
of revenues.   Cost  of revenues includes the cost of raw materials, labor, depreciation
and other overhead costs .  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues was approximately $3.5 million, as compared with approximately $10.0
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $6.5 million, or 65.4%. Cost of revenues for
the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was approximately $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
with approximately $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenues related to the manufacture of
forged rolled rings and related components segment was approximately $19,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared with approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenues for the petroleum and
chemical equipment segment was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with approximately $1.9 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues was approximately $12.0 million as compared with approximately $35.1
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $23.1 million, or 65.7%. Cost of revenues for
the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was approximately $10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
with approximately $18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenues related to the manufacture of
forged rolled rings and related components segment was approximately $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared with approximately $10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenues for the petroleum
and chemical equipment segment was approximately $113,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with approximately
$6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  

Gross
(loss) profit and gross margin.   Our  gross profit was approximately $0.5 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with approximately $2.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, representing gross margins of 12.8% and 16.6%, respectively. Our gross profit was approximately $0.9 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with approximately $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
representing gross margins of 7.1% and 18.1%, respectively.   

Gross
profit for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was approximately $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to approximately $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing gross margins of approximately
12.5% and 23.5%, respectively. Gross profit for the dyeing and finishing equipment segment was approximately $1.9 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with approximately $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
representing gross margins of approximately 15.4% and 23.0%, respectively. The decrease in our gross margin for the dyeing and
finishing equipment segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily resulted from (i) the reduced scale
of operations, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues; (ii)
the decrease in unit sale price in order to compete to other airflow dyeing machinery providers; (iii) the slight increase in
raw material costs. We expect that our gross margin from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will continue to be low in the
remainder of 2016  .  

Gross
profit for the forged rolled rings and related components segment of was approximately $13,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to a negative gross profit of approximately $278,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We had
a gross margin of 40.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a negative gross margin of (19.6)% for
the comparable period of 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, we outsourced our manufacturing for forging products which generated
a gross margin of 40.6%. We determined to outsource our manufacturing since the purchase order amounts received from our customers
are small. We incurred a negative gross profit from forged rolled rings and related components segment of approximately $1.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to gross profit of approximately $1.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. We had a negative gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a gross margin
of 10.5% for the comparable period of 2015. The negative gross margin for the forged rolled rings and related components segment
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily resulted from the reduced scale of operations resulting from much lower
revenues and the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of the reduced level of revenues.    We
are not optimistic about the market for forged rolled rings and related products if we continue to operate in this segment.   

Gross
profit for the petroleum and chemical equipment segment was approximately $18,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to gross profit of approximately $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing gross margins
of approximately 13.8% and 14.8%, respectively. The decrease in our gross margin for the petroleum and chemical equipment segment
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributed to the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower
revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues. We expect
that our gross margin from petroleum and chemical equipment segment will continue to be low in the rest of 2016 if we continue
to operate in this segment.  

Depreciation .  Depreciation
 was approximately $1.1 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Depreciation was approximately $4.5 million and $6.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Depreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was included in
the following categories (dollars in thousands) :  

The
decrease in depreciation expense for cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was mainly attributable to the reduction of net book value of manufacturing equipment
as of December 31, 2015, as a result of writing down, at December 31, 2015, the carrying values of certain manufacturing equipment
used in our forged rolled rings and related components segment and petroleum and chemical equipment segment to their estimated
fair values. At December 31, 2015, we conducted an impairment assessment on property and equipment in our forged rolled rings
and related components and petroleum and chemical equipment segments to determine the estimated fair market value of property
and equipment as of December 31, 2015. Upon completion of the impairment analysis as of December 31, 2015, we determined that
the carrying value exceeded the fair market value on certain equipment used in these two segments. Accordingly, we recorded impairment
charges relating to the write down of the carrying values of certain manufacturing equipment used in these two segments to their
estimated fair values  . In addition, we reflected
certain manufacturing equipment previously used in our forged rolled rings and related components segment and petroleum and chemical
equipment segment as equipment held for sale in the third quarter of 2016. The assets held for sale is no longer subject to depreciation
as they are not used in operations.  

There
 were no events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the
long-lived assets in our forged rolled rings and related components and petroleum and chemical equipment segments at September
30, 2016 may not be fully recoverable. Therefore, we did not recognize any impairment loss during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 .  

Some
manufacturing machinery were temporary idle in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recorded the related depreciation
this machinery as operating expenses rather than as cost of revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Therefore,
our depreciation expense, which was included in operating expenses, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses.   Selling,  general and administrative expenses
totaled approximately $430,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $537,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $107,000 or 19.9%. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately
$1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $2.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $0.7 million or 32.2%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands) :  

Payroll
                                         and related benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately
                                         $16,000, or 12.0%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due
                                         to the stricter control in general and administrative personnel. Payroll and related
                                         benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $359,000,
                                         or 51.4%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly
                                         attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $325,000 which
                                         reflected the decrease in stock-based compensation and bonus incurred and paid to our
                                         management in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and a decrease in employee salaries
                                         and related benefits of approximately $34,000 due to the reduction in staff resulting
                                         from our significant decline in sales and the stricter control in general and administrative
                                         personnel. We expect that payroll and related benefits will remain in its current quarterly
                                         level with minimal increase in the near future.    

Professional
                                         fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by approximately $68,000,
                                         or 151.1%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was
                                         primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based consulting fees of approximately
                                         $57,000 incurred and paid to our consultant, and an increase in other miscellaneous items
                                         of approximately $11,000. Professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
                                         increased by approximately $512,000, or 330.3%, as compared to the nine months ended
                                         September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based
                                         consulting fees of approximately $393,000 incurred and paid to two companies which performed
                                         consulting services relating to preparing and implementing a new business plan for us
                                         with the objective of improving our long-term growth, an increase in stock-based consulting
                                         fees of approximately $113,000 incurred and paid to our consultant, and an increase in
                                         other miscellaneous items of approximately $6,000.    

Other
                                         selling, general and administrative expenses, which primarily consist of office supplies,
                                         vehicle expense, phone expense, amortization of intangible assets, office maintenance,
                                         miscellaneous taxes, etc. Other selling, general and administrative expenses for the
                                         three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by approximately $31,000, or 33.7%, as
                                         compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the three months
                                         ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization for
                                         our patent we purchased in August 2016 of approximately $41,000, offset by a decrease
                                         in other miscellaneous items of approximately $10,000. Other selling, general and administrative
                                         expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $15,000,
                                         or 5.2%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the
                                         nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly due to stricter control on corporation
                                         expending.    

Research
and development expenses .  Research and development expenses were approximately $112,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $24,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately
$88,000, or 367.3%. Research and development expenses were approximately $196,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to approximately $81,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $115,000, or 142.0%.
The increase in 2016 periods was primarily attributable to the increase in research and development activities as compared to
the comparable periods in 2015. Research and development expenses related to the development of new dyeing and finishing products.

(Loss)
income from operations.    As a result of the factors described above, for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to approximately $0.3 million, as compared to income from
operations of approximately $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change of approximately $1.6 million,
or 124.0%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to approximately $1.6 million, as compared
to income from operations of approximately $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of approximately
$6.4 million, or 132.7%.   

Other
income (expense) .   Other income (expense) includes interest income, interest
expense, foreign currency transaction gain/(loss), and other (expense) income .  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total other expense, net, amounted to approximately $45,000 as compared to total other
expense, net, of approximately $49,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $4,000 or 8.5%.
The decrease in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense approximately $7,000, offset
by a decrease in interest income of approximately $3,000  .  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total other expense, net, amounted to approximately $134,000 as compared to total other
expense, net, of approximately $145,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $11,000 or 7.6%.
The decrease in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of approximately $1,000, and
a decrease in interest expense of approximately $10,000  .  

Income
taxes expense .   Income taxes expense was approximately $7,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $326,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of approximately $319,000, or 97.8%. Income taxes expense was approximately $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, as compared to approximately $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1.1million, or 86.3%.
The decrease in income taxes expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in taxable income generated by our operating entities
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable periods in 2015.   

Net
(loss) income.    As a result of the foregoing, our net loss was approximately
$(0.4) million, or $(0.07) per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net
income approximately $0.9 million, or $0.23 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change
of approximately $1.3 million, or 139.8%. Our net loss was approximately $(1.9) million, or $(0.41) per share (basic and diluted),
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net income approximately $3.4 million, or $0.86 per share (basic
and diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of approximately $5.3 million, or 155.8%.   

Foreign
currency translation loss.    The functional currency of our subsidiaries and
variable interest entities operating in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi ( RMB ). The financial statements
of our subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average
rates of exchange (for the period) for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions
are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash
adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $(0.3) million for the three months ended September
30, 2016, as compared with foreign currency translation loss of approximately $(4.2) million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. We reported a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $(2.2) million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, as compared to foreign currency translation loss of approximately $(3.4) million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. This non-cash loss had the effect of increasing our reported comprehensive loss.   

Comprehensive
(loss).    As a result of our foreign currency translation loss, we had comprehensive
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $(0.7) million, compared with comprehensive loss of approximately
$(3.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We had comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 of approximately $(4.0) million, compared with comprehensive loss of approximately $(42,000) for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 .  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash balances of approximately approximately$11.9
million and $18.8 million, respectively. These funds are located in financial institutions located as follows (dollars in thousands)  :  

The
following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 (dollars in
thousands  ):  

Our
working capital increased by $994,000 to $25,925,000 at September 30, 2016 from $24,931,000 at December 31, 2015. This increase
in working capital is primarily attributable   to:  

An
                                         increase in inventories, net of reserve for obsolete inventories, of approximately $1.2
                                         million,   

A
                                         decrease in short-term bank loans of approximately $157,000,   

A
                                         decrease in bank acceptance notes payable of approximately $452,000,   

A
                                         decrease in accounts payable of approximately $333,000,   
 
         A
                                         decrease in accrued liability for claimed sale contract dispute of approximately $5.6
                                         million due to the payments made to resolve the dispute in the nine months ended September
                                         30, 2016,   

A
                                         decrease in accrued expenses of approximately $504,000,   

A
     decrease in VAT and service taxes payable of approximately $160,000, and   

A
     decrease in income taxes payable of approximately $182,000,

Because
the exchange rate conversion is different for the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
changes in assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows are not necessarily identical with the
comparable changes reflected on the consolidated balance sheets  .  

Net
cash flow used in operating activities was approximately $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to net cash flow provided by operating activities of approximately $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
a decrease of approximately $15.9 million  .

                                         nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected net loss of approximately $1.9
                                         million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of an increase
                                         in accounts receivable of approximately $321,000, an increase in inventories of approximately

                                         accrued expenses of approximately $5.9 million, mainly due to the payments made to solve
                                         claimed sale contract dispute as described in elsewhere in this report, a decrease in
                                         VAT and service taxes payable of approximately $155,000, a decrease in income taxes payable
                                         of approximately $178,000, offset by the add-back of non-cash items primarily consisting
                                         of depreciation of approximately $4.5 million, amortization of intangible assets of approximately
                                         $108,000, and stock-based compensation and fees of approximately $583,000, and changes
                                         in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of a decrease in prepaid and
                                         other current assets of approximately $186,000.     

Net
                                         cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
                                         primarily reflected net income of approximately $3.4 million, and the add-back of non-cash

                                         $286,000, and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of a decrease
                                         in accounts receivable of approximately $2.5 million due to the collecting efforts made
                                         in 2015, a decrease in inventories of approximately $250,000, and an increase in advances
                                         from customers of approximately $370,000, offset by an increase in notes receivable of
                                         approximately $143,000, an increase in advances to suppliers of approximately $86,000,

Net
cash flow used in investing activities was approximately $2.4 million and $13,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flow used in investing
activities reflects the purchase of patent use rights of approximately $2.4 million and purchase of property and equipment of
approximately $14,000  . For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, net cash flow used in investing activities reflects the purchase of property and equipment of
approximately $13,000.  

Net
cash flow provided by financing activities was approximately $609,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to net cash flow provided by financing activities of approximately $162,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received proceeds from bank loans of approximately $3.0 million, proceeds from the
decrease in restricted cash of approximately $372,000, and proceeds from sale of common stock of approximately $753,000, offset
by repayments for bank loans of approximately $3.0 million, and decrease in bank acceptance notes payable of approximately $441,000.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received proceeds from bank loans of approximately $4.5 million, and proceeds
from the increase in bank acceptance notes payable of approximately $114,000, offset by repayments for bank loans of approximately
$4.4 million, and payments for the increase in restricted cash of approximately $114,000.  

We
generally finance our operations through short term loans from our banks, which we refinance upon expiration. We believe that
our cash flow from operations and bank financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve
months.   

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

Contractual
Obligations    

We
have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs,
cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates.
We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant
assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information
within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  

The
following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands), and the effect these obligations
are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods  .  

(1)    Bank
                                          loans consisted of short term bank loans. Historically,
                                         we have refinanced these bank loans for an additional term of six months to one year
                                         and we expect to continue to refinance these loans upon expiration .    

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder s equity
or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do
not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support
to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us  .  

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk    

We
produce and sell almost all of our products in China. Thus, most of our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange
rate fluctuations between RMB and US dollars. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had unrealized foreign
currency translation loss of approximately $(0.3) million and $(2.2) million, respectively, because of changes in the exchange
rate  .  

Inflation    

The
effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant  .

4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, including Jianhua Wu, our chief executive officer, and Wanfen
Xu, our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016  .  

Disclosure
controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures  .  

Management
conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Wu and Ms. Xu concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of September 30, 2016  .  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Section
404 ). As reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and, during our assessment, management identified significant deficiencies
related to (i) the U.S. GAAP expertise of our internal accounting staff and recently elected chief financial officer, (ii) our
internal audit functions and (iii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. Although management believes that
these deficiencies do not amount to a material weakness, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at
December 31, 2015.  

We
currently have no plans to expand our company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system during the rest of
2016 and have not implemented further ERP modules to manage inventory and to expand existing ERP systems to other areas of our
factory. Due to our working capital requirements and the lack of local professionals with the necessary experience in implementing
the ERP system, we postponed the hiring of professional staff to implement ERP system. We have found that engaging professionals
who are based outside of Wuxi is very costly and we have not been able to find qualified personnel in the Wuxi area.  

Due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.
As a result, we have not been able to take steps to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. However, to the extent possible, we will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions,
the custody of assets and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals  .  

A
material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet
important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s financial reporting.  

In
light of this significant deficiency, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated
in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our significant deficiency, our consolidated financial
statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with the U.S.
GAAP.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal
controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting  .

registrant and have:   

a)  
      designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,

b)  
      designed

    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;   

5.  
      The registrant s other certifying officer and
I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

b)  
      any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal controls over financial reporting.
