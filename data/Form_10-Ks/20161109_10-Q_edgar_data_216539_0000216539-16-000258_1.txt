  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Note     1: Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and with applicable quarterly reporting regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Media General, Inc. ("Media General" or the "Company") for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of interim financial information have been included. 
    
  In September 2015, the Company announced a merger agreement under which the Company would have acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Meredith Corporation ( Meredith ) in a cash and stock transaction.  Later in September of 2015 the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc. ( Nexstar ) to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Media General.  Following discussion between the various parties, in January 2016 Media General terminated its agreement with Meredith, with Media General paying Meredith a   $60 million   termination fee and providing Meredith with an opportunity to negotiate for the purchase of certain broadcast and digital assets owned by the Company.  Immediately thereafter, the Company entered into an agreement with Nexstar whereby Nexstar will acquire all outstanding shares of Media General for   $10.55   per share in cash,   0.1249   shares of Nexstar Class A common stock for each Media General share and a contingent value right (CVR).  The cash consideration and the stock consideration are fixed amounts and do not increase or decrease based upon the proceeds (if any) from the disposition of either Nexstar's or Media General's spectrum in the Federal Communications Commission's ("FCC") Incentive Auction. Upon the completion of the transaction, Nexstar will change its name to Nexstar Media Group. Each CVR will entitle Media General shareholders to a pro rata share of the net cash proceeds as received from the sale of Media General's spectrum in the FCC's Incentive Auction. It is estimated that Media General shareholders will own approximately   34%   and existing Nexstar shareholders will retain approximately   66%   ownership of the combined company after closing.   The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including, but not limited to, the approval of various matters relating to the transaction by Media General and Nexstar shareholders, the approval of the FCC, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act and certain third party consents. On September 15, 2016 the transaction received clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act.  Merger-related expenses for legal and professional fees for the Nexstar transaction totaled   $1.4 million   for the three months ended September  30, 2016.  Merger-related expenses for the Meredith termination fee, legal and professional fees for the Meredith and Nexstar transactions totaled   $69 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
    
  In connection with the Nexstar transaction, Nexstar and its respective subsidiaries, as applicable, have entered into definitive agreements to divest Nexstar's WCWJ station in Jacksonville, Florida and the Company's WSLS-TV station in Roanoke-Lynchburg, Virginia to Graham Media Group, Inc.; Nexstar's KADN-TV and KLAF-LD stations in Lafayette, Louisiana to Bayou City Broadcasting Lafayette, Inc.; Nexstar's KREG-TV station in Denver, Colorado to Marquee Broadcasting, Inc.; the Company's WBAY-TV station in Green Bay, Wisconsin and KWQC-TV station in Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, Iowa to Gray Television Group, Inc.; the Company's KIMT station in Rochester, Minnesota, WTHI-TV station in Terre Haute, Indiana, WLFI-TV station in Lafayette, Indiana, as well as Nexstar's WFFT-TV station in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and KQTV station in Saint Joseph, Missouri to USA Television MidAmerica Holdings, LLC; and the Company's KASA-TV station in Albuquerque, New Mexico to Ramar Communications, Inc. The Company expects that the sales of these stations will occur substantially concurrent with the closing of the transaction with Nexstar, which is expected to occur later this year. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities ( VIE ) for which the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE for financial reporting purposes, the Company considers whether it has the power to direct certain activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and whether it has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns that would be significant to the VIE.  Assets of consolidated VIE s can only be used to settle the obligations of that VIE.  As discussed in Note 3, the Company consolidates the results of WXXA, WLAJ, WBDT, WYTV, KTKA, KWBQ, KRWB, and KASY pursuant to the VIE accounting guidance. All of the liabilities are non-recourse to the Company, except for certain of the debt, which the Company guarantees. The Company is also the primary beneficiary of the VIE that holds the Supplemental 401(k) Plan s investments and consolidates the plan accordingly.

The Company has   two   reportable segments,  Broadcast  and  Digital  that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities. The Broadcast segment includes   71   television stations that are either owned, operated or serviced by the Company in   48   markets, all of which are engaged principally in the sale of television advertising. The Digital segment includes the operating results of the Company's digital businesses as well as the business operations related to the television station companion websites.  
    
  The Company guarantees all of the debt of LIN Television Corporation ("LIN Television", a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) and the debt of its consolidated VIEs. LIN Television guarantees all of the debt of its restricted wholly owned subsidiaries and the debt of its consolidated VIEs. All of the consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries of LIN Television fully and unconditionally guarantee LIN Television's   5.875%   Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ) and the   6.375%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") on a joint-and-several basis, subject to customary release provisions. 
        
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued a converged standard on revenue recognition from contracts with customers, Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09 (Topic 606 and IFRS 15). This standard will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance.   In August 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue From Contracts With Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date   which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  In April and May 2016, the Board issued accounting standard updates, 2016-10   - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , and 2016-12   - Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , respectively.  Collectively, these updates, along with ASU 2014-09  and ASU 2015-14 form the new revenue recognition standard that is to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ("ASU 2015-03").  ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015.   The Company  adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 and   $26 million   was reclassified to reduce "Long-term Debt" as of September 30, 2016.   In order to conform to the presentation adopted,   $32 million   was reclassified from "Other assets, net" to "Long-term Debt" in the 2015 figures presented on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets and in Note 10 Guarantor Financial Information. Approximately   $285 thousand   was reclassified from "Other assets, net" to "Long-term Debt" in the 2015 figures presented in Note 3 Variable Interest Entities. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The ASU includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2:     Segment Information 
    
  The Company has   two   reportable operating segments,  Broadcast  and  Digital  that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities. The Broadcast segment includes   71   television stations that are either owned, operated or serviced by the Company in   48   U.S. markets, all of which are engaged principally in the sale of television advertising. The Digital segment includes the operating results of the digital companies (New Federated Media and HYFN) as well as the business operations related to the television station companion websites. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include costs to operate as a public company and to operate corporate locations. 

6 

The Company identifies operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) allocates resources, assesses performance and makes decisions. The CODM is the President, and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on operating income or loss for the Broadcast and Digital segments, excluding non-segment expenses. 

Note 3:     Variable Interest Entities 
    
  Certain of the Company's broadcast stations provide services to other station owners within the same market via Joint Sales Agreements ("JSA") and/or Shared Service Agreements ("SSA"). The Company has JSA and/or SSA agreements with   8   stations. Depending on the specific terms of these agreements, the Company may provide a variety of operational and administrative services, assume an obligation to reimburse certain expenses of the stations and guarantee certain external borrowings by the station licenses (refer to Note 5 for guaranteed borrowings). The Company is compensated for these services through performance based and/or administrative fees. Under certain JSAs, the Company has an option to acquire the related station at any time, subject to FCC consent, until the expiration of the applicable JSA. The Company has determined that the stations with which it has JSAs and/or SSAs, and certain of their parent companies, are VIEs as a result of the terms of the agreements.  
    
  The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, because (a) subject to the ultimate control of the broadcast licensees, the Company has the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs through the services the Company provides and (b) the Company absorbs returns and losses which would be considered significant to the VIEs. Therefore, the financial results and financial position of these entities have been consolidated by the Company in accordance with the VIE accounting guidance.  
    
  The carrying amounts and classification of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIE entities described above, which have been included in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

7 

The assets of the Company s consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIEs and may not be sold, or otherwise disposed of, except for assets sold or replaced with others of like kind or value. At September 30, 2016, the Company has an option to acquire the assets or member's interest of the VIE entities that it may exercise if the FCC attribution rules change to permit the Company to acquire such interest. The option exercise price is of nominal value and significantly less than the carrying value of their tangible and intangible net assets. The options are carried at   zero   on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, as any value attributable to the options is eliminated in the consolidation of the VIEs. In May 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's 2014 rule attributing JSAs for purposes of the media ownership rules if they permitted a television licensee to sell more than   15%   of the commercial inventory of a television station owned by a third party in the same market. On August 10, 2016, the FCC adopted a Second Report and Order that reinstated the attribution of JSAs. However, JSAs in existence before March 31, 2014 (including the Company's) were grandfathered, meaning that they will not be counted as attributable and may be transferred or assigned until September 30, 2025. 

Note 4: Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment 
    
  The Company s Digital business units were recorded at fair value in conjunction with the LIN Merger in December of 2014.  Due to a projected decrease in operating results of the Company's Digital businesses, the Company performed an interim impairment assessment as of September 30, 2015 on   three   Digital reporting units acquired as part of the LIN Merger. The turnover of key sales personnel and the industry-wide shift to software enabled automated buying and placement of digital advertising led to a decrease in projected operating results for the Company's historical arbitrage media placement businesses. As a result of the impairment review,   two   of the   three   reporting units passed the first step of the evaluation as their fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than   10%  . The fair value of the third reporting unit, LIN Digital, did not exceed its carrying value. As a result, the Company performed the second step of the impairment test and recorded a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge at its LIN Digital reporting unit of   $53 million   in the third quarter of 2015. After recording the impairment charge, the goodwill allocated to the LIN Digital reporting unit was   $80 million   at September 30, 2015. The total goodwill allocated to the Digital segment at September 30, 2015 was   $195 million  , including the Company s social media business.  
    
  In early 2016, the Company combined these   three   distinct businesses into   one   business, New Federated Media, under new management and made significant changes to its sales force.  The Company had expected these changes would enable the  
  
   8 

business to operate more effectively in the marketplace with an acceleration of growth in the second half of 2016.  However, the industry-wide shift to software enabled automated buying and placement of digital advertising quickened and combined with a rapid rise in social media advertising have led to compressed margins and lowered demand for the Company s other digital products.  As a result the Company has not experienced the acceleration of revenues it had expected in the second half of 2016.  Therefore the Company performed another interim impairment test as of September 30, 2016.  Additionally, the dynamics of the marketplace have changed significantly due to the industry-wide shifts discussed above so that the Company s long-term forecast now reflects margins at half the level it had previously expected.   This combination of slower growth and reduced margins has resulted in both non-cash goodwill impairment and non-cash intangible asset impairment totaling a combined   $113 million   that was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.  After recording the impairment charges, the goodwill allocated to New Federated Media was   $30 million   as of September 30, 2016.  The total goodwill allocated to the Digital segment, which includes the Company s social media business that was unaffected by the impairment charges, as of September 30, 2016 was   $101 million  .  Identified intangible assets of the Digital segment include trade names, advertiser and publisher relationships, and certain existing technology assets and totaled   $23 million   following the impairment with a weighted average useful life of   3   years. 
    
  The estimated fair value of reporting units was determined using a combination of an income approach and a market comparable method. The income approach utilizes the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit assets. The market comparable method employs comparable company information, and where available, recent transaction information for similar assets. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the relief from royalty, comparable profit margin, and reproduction new less depreciation methods. The determination of fair value requires the use of significant judgment and estimates that management believes are appropriate in the circumstances although it is reasonably possible that actual performance will differ from these estimates and the effect of any differences could be material. These estimates include those relating to revenue growth, compensation levels, digital advertising placement prices, capital expenditures, discount rates and market trading multiples for digital advertising assets.   

Note     5:     Debt and Other Financial Instruments 
    
  Long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows: 

Media General Credit Agreement   
    
  In July 2013, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to provide the Company with a term loan and access to a revolving credit facility. The funds borrowed under the credit agreement and subsequent amendments (together the "Credit Agreement") have been used by the Company to facilitate acquisitions and mergers. The term loan under the Credit Agreement matures in July 2020 and bears interest at LIBOR (with a floor of   1%  ) plus a margin of   3%  . 
    
  The Company repaid of   $60 million   principal on the term loan during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company repaid   $25 million   and   $160 million   of principal on the term loan during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The early repayment of debt resulted in debt extinguishment costs of   $0.9 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to the accelerated recognition of deferred debt-related items. The early repayment of debt resulted in debt extinguishment costs of   $0.4 million   and   $2.8 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, due to the accelerated recognition of deferred debt-related items. As of September 30, 2016, there was just under   $1.5 billion   outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 
  
   9 

The Credit Agreement also includes revolving credit commitments of   $150 million  . The revolving credit facility matures in October 2019, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of   2.50%   and is subject to a   0.5%   commitment fee per annum with respect to the undrawn portion of the facility.  The Company has   $146 million   of availability under the revolving credit facility (giving effect to   $3.6 million   of letters of credit which have been issued but are undrawn). 
    
  Shield Media Credit Agreement 
    
  WXXA-TV LLC (a subsidiary of Shield Media LLC) and WLAJ-TV LLC (a subsidiary of Shield Media Lansing LLC) (collectively,  Shield Media ), with which the Company has joint sales and shared services arrangements as described in Note 3, entered into a credit agreement for   two   of its stations with a syndicate of lenders, dated July 31, 2013.

  2022 Notes 
    
  On November 5, 2014, the Company's predecessor, MGOC, Inc. ("Old Media General") completed the issuance of   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2022 (the  2022 Notes ) in connection with the financing of the Old Media General's combination (the "LIN Merger") with LIN Media, LLC ("LIN Media"). The net proceeds from the offering of the 2022 Notes were used to repay certain indebtedness of LIN Media in connection with the LIN Merger, including the satisfaction and discharge of LIN Television s   $200 million   aggregate principal amount of   8.375%   Senior Notes due 2018 and the payment of related fees and expenses. The 2022 Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of November 5, 2014 (the  2022 Notes Indenture ). Media General, as the direct parent of LIN Television, and certain of the wholly owned subsidiaries of LIN Television provide full and unconditional guarantees to the 2022 Notes, on a senior basis. 
    
  2021     Notes

Following the consummation of the LIN Merger, Media General, as the direct parent of LIN Television, and certain of the wholly owned subsidiaries of LIN Television provide full and unconditional guarantees of the 2021 Notes, on a senior basis. The Company received an unsolicited offer and repaid   $15 million   of principal at an   $800 thousand   premium during the year ended December 31, 2015.    No   principal payments were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2021 Notes was   $275 million  .

  Under the fair value hierarchy, the Company s trading securities fall under Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets), the 2021 and 2022 Notes fall under Level 2 (other observable inputs) and the Media General Credit Agreement, Shield Media Credit Agreement and Other Borrowings fall under Level 3 (unobservable inputs). 

Note     6: Taxes on Income 
    
  The effective tax rate was a negative   17.4%   in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to   7.3%   in the third quarter of 2015 and a negative   2.5%   in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to   6.6%   in the equivalent prior-year period. The low tax rates in both periods were due to the goodwill and other asset impairment charges that were largely non-deductible for tax purposes. The tax expense in both years was predominantly non-cash due to the Company s significant net operating loss carryover.  Current tax expense was approximately   $1.7 million   and   $0.4 million   for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was approximately   $4.0 million   and   $1.9 million   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively; it was attributable primarily to state income and AMT taxes.

  The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted income per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

12 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we have excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share   946 thousand   and   1.5 million  , respectively, of common shares issuable for share options and restricted shares, because the net loss causes these shares to be anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we have excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share   1.1 million   and   1.3 million  , respectively, of common shares issuable for share options and restricted shares, because the net loss causes these shares to be anti-dilutive.  

Note 8:     Retirement and Postretirement Plans

  Restructuring activities 
    
  In September 2015 the Company adopted a plan to restructure certain Digital segment operations. Additional steps were taken on that plan in the first quarter of 2016. The plan is expected to save the Company approximately   $14.7 million   in operating costs annually based on the steps completed since plan inception and the cumulative expense incurred is   $3.9 million  . The Company recorded restructuring expense of   $2.3 million   related to the plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The restructuring income for the period was a result of adjustments within the period to lease termination liability due to a recently signed sublease. Year-to-date restructuring expense was comprised of   $1.8 million   of severance and   $501 thousand   of asset impairment charges.   

14 

On October 16, 2009, Media General entered into a Joint Sales Agreement ( JSA ) and Shared Services Agreement ( SSA ) with Schurz Communications, Inc and WAGT Television, Inc.   Pursuant to the JSA and SSA, Media General provided certain services and sold advertising time for WAGT. In February 2016, Schurz Communications, Inc. sold WAGT to Gray Television Group, Inc., ("Gray") and assigned the JSA and SSA to Gray.  However, upon the closing of the station sale, WAGT ceased performance of the agreements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $2.6 million   for WAGT.  As of  September 30, 2016, Media General has pending legal causes of action against Gray, Schurz Communications, Inc. and WAGT Television, Inc., including but not limited to, causes of action for breach of contract. The Company agreed to stay this litigation pending the closing of the Nexstar merger and the divestiture of certain stations with Gray (as discussed in Note 1).  If the transactions close, the parties will dismiss all claims and counterclaims with no additional consideration for either party.  If not, the parties may resume the litigation.  During the third quarter, the Company paid   $700 thousand   to the FCC to settle issues related to WAGT. 
    
  The following tables present the activity associated with the September 30, 2016 balance of the restructuring liability and the nature and amount of exit charges incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Acquisition of HYFN 
    
  In April 2016, the Company acquired the remaining shares of HYFN, a full service digital advertising agency for a purchase price of approximately   $35 million   plus a one-time compensation expense of   $7 million   related to the transaction for a total cash outflow of   $42 million  .  The   $7 million   one-time compensation expense is included in "Corporate and other expenses" on the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income for the nine months ending September 30, 2016.  Prior to the transaction, the Company held   50.1%   of the outstanding shares of HYFN. As a result of the transaction, HYFN is   100%   owned by the Company beginning with the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Share repurchase 
    
  The Company repurchased   0.9 million   and    2.1 million   shares of its outstanding voting common stock at an average price of   $15.80   and   $16.16   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The total cost of the repurchases was   $15 million   and   $34 million   for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2015.

Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  OVERVIEW 
    
   Media General is one of the U.S. s largest local multimedia companies, providing top-rated news, information and entertainment across   48   markets. Media General, Inc. owns, operates or provides services to   71   network-affiliated broadcast television stations (  23   with CBS,   13   with NBC,   12   with ABC,   8   with FOX,   8   with CW and   7   with MyNetworkTV) and their associated digital media and mobile platforms. These stations reach approximately   23%   of U.S. TV households, and the Company reaches nearly   41%   of the U.S. Internet audience.   50   of the   71   stations are located in the top 100 designated market areas as grouped by Nielsen ( DMAs ), while   27   of the   71   stations are located in the top 50 markets. The Company also has a large and diverse digital media business. 
    
  In September 2015, the Company announced a merger agreement under which the Company would have acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Meredith Corporation ( Meredith ) in a cash and stock transaction.  Later in September of 2015 the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc. ( Nexstar ) to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Media General.  Following discussion between the various parties, in January 2016 Media General terminated its agreement with Meredith, with Media General paying Meredith a   $60 million   termination fee and providing Meredith with an opportunity to negotiate for the purchase of certain broadcast and digital assets owned by the Company.  Immediately thereafter, the Company entered into an agreement with Nexstar whereby Nexstar will acquire all outstanding shares of Media General for   $10.55   per share in cash,   0.1249   shares of Nexstar Class A common stock for each Media General share and a contingent value right (CVR).  The cash consideration and the stock consideration are fixed amounts and do not increase or decrease based upon the proceeds (if any) from the disposition of either Nexstar's or Media General's spectrum in the FCC's Incentive Auction. Upon the completion of the transaction, Nexstar will change its name to Nexstar Media Group. Each CVR will entitle Media General shareholders to a pro rata share of the net cash proceeds as received from the sale of Media General's spectrum in the FCC's Incentive Auction.  It is estimated that Media General shareholders will own approximately   34%   and existing Nexstar shareholders will retain approximately   66%   ownership of the combined company after closing.   The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including, but not limited to, the approval of various matters relating to the transaction by Media General and Nexstar shareholders, the approval of the FCC, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act and certain third party consents.  On September 15, 2016, the transaction received clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act.  
    
  In connection with the Nexstar transaction, Nexstar and its respective subsidiaries, as applicable, have entered into definitive agreements to divest  Nexstar's WCWJ station in Jacksonville, Florida and the Company's WSLS-TV station in Roanoke-Lynchburg, Virginia to Graham Media Group, Inc.; Nexstar's KADN-TV and KLAF-LD stations in Lafayette, Louisiana to Bayou City Broadcasting Lafayette, Inc.; Nexstar's KREG-TV station in Denver, Colorado to Marquee Broadcasting, Inc.; the Company's WBAY-TV station in Green Bay, Wisconsin and KWQC-TV station in Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, Iowa to Gray Television Group, Inc.; the Company's KIMT station in Rochester, Minnesota, WTHI-TV station in Terre Haute, Indiana, WLFI-TV station in Lafayette, Indiana, as well as Nexstar's WFFT-TV station in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and KQTV station in Saint Joseph, Missouri to USA Television MidAmerica Holdings, LLC; and the Company's KASA-TV station in Albuquerque, New Mexico to Ramar Communications, Inc. The Company expects that the sales of these stations will occur substantially concurrent with the closing of the transaction with Nexstar, which is expected to occur later this year. 
    
  In April 2012, President Obama signed into law the American Jobs Act, which provides the FCC with the authority to 
  conduct an  incentive auction  to auction and repurpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. Pursuant to this authority and to encourage broadcasters to tender their licenses for auction, the FCC is permitted to share the proceeds of spectrum auction with incumbent television station licensees. In order to receive proceeds, licensees must agree to give up their licenses, share spectrum, or, in some cases, move to a different channel to facilitate an auction of their previous channel. The FCC would then  repack  non-tendering UHF broadcasters into the lower portions of the UHF band and auction new  flexible use  wireless licenses in the upper portion of the UHF band. By statute, television stations  participation in the incentive auction is voluntary. Two stages of both the reverse auction and forward auctions have closed.  Stage 3 of the incentive auction will begin on November 1, 2016.  Depending on the outcome of Stage 3, the FCC may conduct one or more additional stages of the incentive auction.  No auction results have been finalized.  As part of the Nexstar agreement, the Company has a contingent value right entitling Media General shareholders to a pro rata share of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of Media General s spectrum. The Company anticipates that this right could be worth anywhere from $0 to $4 per share. 
  
   25 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The Company recorded net losses attributable to Media General of   $68.7 million   (  $0.53   per diluted share) and    $76.4 million   ($  0.59   per diluted share) in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net losses attributable to Media General of   $48.5 million   (  $0.38   per diluted share) and   $54.3 million   (  $0.42   per diluted share) in the equivalent periods of   2015  . The net loss attributable to Media General for the third quarter of   2016   increased $20 million from the equivalent period in the prior year driven by a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of  $113 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016.   The third quarter of 2015 included a smaller goodwill impairment charge of $53 million. The Company's results during the first   nine   months of   2016   included the $113 million impairment charge, $69 million of merger-related expenses (including a $60 million termination fee paid to Meredith in January 2016) and restructuring expenses of   $5 million  .   Comparatively, the Company's results during the first   nine   months of   2015   included the $53 million impairment charge, merger-related expenses of $19 million, non-operating gains of $5.6 million (in Other, net) on the relocation of broadcast channels in Lansing, Michigan and Austin, Texas and a $2.5 million reduction in Operating Expenses for settlement proceeds related to prior-period overcharges by a music licensing agency.  
    
  Net loss for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $  67.6 million   and included net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $  1.2 million  .   For the first   nine   months of   2016   the Company recorded a net loss of   $74 million   and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of    $2.4 million  .  The income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the aggregate income of certain stations operated by the Company through JSA/SSA arrangements. The remaining noncontrolling interest in HYFN Inc. was acquired by the Company on April 1, 2016. 
    
  The Company generated $  130 million   and   $352 million   of operating income from its Broadcast segment in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Its Digital segment recorded operating income of $  4.9 million   and   $6.4 million   during the same periods.  

REVENUES 
    
  Revenues were   $377 million   and   $1.1 billion   in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, compared to $  322 million   and   $939 million   in the same prior-year periods. Revenues are grouped primarily into four major categories:  Local, National, Political and Digital.  The following chart summarizes the consolidated period-over-period changes in these select revenue categories.  

26 

Local revenue increased   $38 million   and   $89 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as a result of increased retransmission revenue and, to a lesser extent, an increase in core advertising. Core advertising revenue increased 2.7% for the quarter, driven by strong summer Olympic advertising.  For the year-to-date, core advertising increased 1.1% driven by medical, retail, home improvement and automotive advertising. Political revenue for the quarter was over 5 times the prior-year level due to strong advertising levels in Ohio, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  Political for the year-to-date was six-fold the prior-year level due to the Presidential election and other contested races in this even-numbered year.  The   9%   decrease in Digital revenue for the quarter was the result of lower National and Regional advertising due to the loss of certain advertisers.  The   10%   increase in Digital revenue for the year-to-date was primarily the result of increased activity in social media, increased Local advertising and higher traffic on our stations' websites. 

OPERATING COSTS 
    
  Total operating costs increased $  53 million   and   $158 million   in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively,  from the prior-year equivalent periods.  The increases during both the quarter and year-to-date periods are due in large part to a   $113 million   goodwill and other asset impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2016 (compared to a charge of   $53 million   recorded during the third quarter of 2015) and increased network programming payments, which rose $14 million and $40 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   Additionally, the first nine months of 2016 included a $60 million fee paid to Meredith to terminate that merger agreement and a $7 million one-time payment related to the purchase of HYFN (as discussed in Item 1, Note 10). The increase in network programming payments was driven in large part by the increase in retransmission revenue.  Absent the impairment charges, merger-related expenses, restructuring costs, the one-time acquisition-related compensation and higher network fees, total operating costs for the third quarter decreased  4% from the same period in the prior year and total operating costs for the first nine months of 2016 were flat when compared to the same period in 2015, reflecting effective expense management.  
    
  Corporate and other expenses as reported on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income decreased by $  3.9 million  , or 31%, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , due to lower stock-based compensation and the favorable impact of merger related synergies.   For the first nine months of   2016  , Corporate and other expenses decreased   $491 thousand   despite a one-time acquisition-related compensation payment of $7 million related to HYFN as discussed above.   Excluding the impact of the one-time payment, Corporate expenses would have decreased 21% for the first nine months of 2016 due to lower stock-based compensation and the impact of merger related synergies. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense as reported on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income was $  41 million   and   $121 million   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $40 million   and   $123 million   in the corresponding prior-year periods.  
    
  The Company recorded $  1.4 million   and $  10 million   of merger-related costs in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, as shown on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily for employee severance, investment banking, legal and professional fees related to the LIN Merger and the merger with Nexstar (reflected in 2016 only). The 2016 costs also included legal fees related to the terminated merger with Meredith.   Merger-related costs for the first nine months of 2016 were   $69 million   compared to   $19 million   in the first nine months of 2015.  The merger-related expenses for the first nine months of 2016 included a $60 million termination fee associated with the terminated Meredith merger, employee severance, investment banking, legal, and professional fees related to the LIN Merger,  the Nexstar Merger and the terminated merger with Meredith.  Merger-related costs for the first nine months of 2015 were primarily for restructuring, investment banking, legal and professional fees related to the LIN Merger and the terminated merger with Meredith.     
  
   27 

The Company recorded restructuring charges of $4.9 million for first nine months of  2016 related to the Digital operations and WAGT.  In September 2015, the Company adopted a plan to restructure certain Digital segment operations (as discussed in Item 1, Note 10), which is expected to save the Company   $14.7 million   in operating costs annually. The Company took additional steps under this plan in the first quarter of 2016.  The Company recorded restructuring expense of   $2.3   million related to the plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded restructuring expense of   $2.6   million related to WAGT as described in Item 1, Note 10.  As of September 30, 2016, Media General has pending legal causes of action against Gray, and Schurz Communications, Inc. and WAGT Television, Inc., including but not limited to, causes of action for breach of contract. The Company has agreed to stay this litigation pending the closing of the Nexstar merger and the divestiture of certain stations with Gray (as discussed in Item 1, Note 1).  If the transactions close, the parties will dismiss all claims and counterclaims with no additional consideration for either party.  If not, the parties may resume the litigation. 

INTEREST EXPENSE 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , interest expense was   $29 million   and   $86 million  , respectively, representing a decrease of   3.2%   and   4.7%   from the corresponding periods in the prior year due to repayments of debt during 2016. The Company s effective interest rate was just over 5% for all periods presented.  
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company repaid $60 million of principal and premium on the Media General term loan as well as $3 million on the Shield loans and certain other borrowings.  The Company was only required to make aggregate principal payments of $2.9 million.   

INCOME TAXES 
    
  The effective tax rate was a negative   17.4%   in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to   7.3%   in the third quarter of 2015.  The effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2016 was a negative   2.5%   as compared to   6.6%   in the equivalent prior-year period. The low tax rates in both periods were due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that were largely non-deductible for tax purposes. The tax expense in both years was predominantly non-cash due to the Company s significant net operating loss carryover.  Current tax expense was approximately   $1.7 million   and   $0.4 million   for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was approximately   $4.0 million   and   $1.9 million   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively; it was attributable primarily to state and AMT income taxes. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) in the first nine months of 2016 was $2.9 million. 
    
  The Company records income tax expense using the liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the differing treatments of various items for financial reporting versus tax reporting purposes. The Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Included in that analysis is the fact that the Company has carried forward an estimated $481 million of net operating losses (NOLs) as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company anticipates being able to use these NOLs before they expire over the course of the next 20 years, although there are certain limitations in future years. 

OTHER 
    
  The Company s Digital business units were recorded at fair value in conjunction with the LIN Merger in December of 2014.  Due to a projected decrease in operating results of the Company's Digital businesses, the Company performed an interim impairment assessment as of September 30, 2015 on three Digital reporting units acquired as part of the LIN Merger. The turnover of key sales personnel and the industry-wide shift to software enabled automated buying and placement of digital advertising led to a decrease in projected operating results for the Company's historical arbitrage media placement businesses. As a result of the impairment review, two of the three reporting units passed the first step of the evaluation as their fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%. The fair value of the third reporting unit, LIN Digital, did not exceed its carrying value. As a result, the Company performed the second step of the impairment test and recorded a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge at its LIN Digital reporting unit of $53 million in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  In early 2016, the Company combined these three distinct businesses into one business, New Federated Media, under new management and made significant changes to its sales force.  The Company had expected these changes would enable the business to operate more effectively in the marketplace with an acceleration of growth in the second half of 2016.  However, the industry-wide shift to software enabled automated buying and placement of digital advertising quickened and combined with a rapid rise in social media advertising have led to compressed margins and lowered demand for the Company s other digital products.  As a result the Company has not experienced the acceleration of revenues it had expected in the second half of 2016.  Additionally,  
  
   28 

the dynamics of the marketplace have changed significantly so that the Company s long-term forecast now reflects margins at half the level it had previously expected.   Therefore the Company performed another interim impairment test as of September 30, 2016.  This combination of slower growth and reduced margins has resulted in both non-cash goodwill impairment and non-cash intangible asset impairment totaling a combined $113 million that was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.  After recording the impairment charges, the goodwill allocated to New Federated Media was $30 million as of September 30, 2016.  The calculation of impairment involves the use of significant judgment and estimates that management believes are appropriate in the circumstances although it is reasonably possible that actual performance will differ from these estimates.   These estimates include those relating to revenue growth, compensation levels, digital advertising placement prices, capital expenditures, discount rates and market trading multiples for digital advertising assets.   
       
  In April 2016, the Company acquired the remaining shares of HYFN, a full service digital advertising agency for a purchase price of approximately   $35 million   plus one-time compensation expense of   $7 million   related to the transaction for a total cash outflow of   $42 million  .  Prior to the transaction, the Company held   50.1%   of the outstanding shares of HYFN. As a result of the transaction, HYFN is   100%   owned by the Company beginning with the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded non-operating gains of $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively, related to agreements with a telecommunications company to relocate broadcast channels in our Lansing, Michigan and Austin, Texas markets.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The Company s primary source of liquidity is its cash flow from operations, but it also has access to a $150 million revolving credit facility and cash on its balance sheet. The Company has   $146 million   of availability under the revolving credit facility (giving effect to   $3.6 million   of letters of credit which have been issued but are undrawn) and $  58 million   of cash on its balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . There is   $5.7 million   of cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , which can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIEs as discussed in Note 3.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company has used its cash for the Meredith termination fee, to pay down debt and make capital expenditures. 
     
  The Company   generated   $  142 million   of cash   from   operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This compared to   $135 million   of net cash   generated   by operating activities in the year-ago period. The increase from the year-ago period is primarily the result of increased retransmission and Political revenues.  
    
  The Company internally, and analysts in the Broadcast industry, use a non-GAAP Broadcast Cash Flow (BCF) metric as a key measure. BCF is defined as operating income plus corporate and other expenses, depreciation and amortization, net gains related to property and equipment, program license rights amortization less payments for program license rights, merger-related expenses, and restructuring expenses. As shown in the table that follows, BCF   increased   from   $90 million   to   $135 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and from   $264 million   to   $357 million   in the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to the impact of Political, Olympic and retransmission revenue during 2016: 

29 

The Company used cash for its investing activities of   $  28 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016   primarily due to   $34 million   of capital expenditures partially offset by   $6.2 million   of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.  Investing activities provided cash of $84 million for the first nine months of 2015 primarily due to the release from a qualified intermediary of $120 million in restricted cash related to the 2014 sale of WJAR-TV and $3.1 million related to the relocation of broadcast channels in Lansing, Michigan and Austin, Texas.  The cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures of   $41 million  .  
    
  Cash used by financing activities of $  97 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to cash used by financing activities of $  225 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During 2016 the Company repaid $63 million of debt and also had a $35 million cash outflow related to the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in HYFN.  The higher outflow in 2015 primarily resulted from debt repayments of $178 million, an $11 million cash outflow related to the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Dedicated Media and cash payments of $34 million for share repurchases under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors during 2015. 
    
  Debt Agreements 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following debt facilities and other debt instruments: 

30 

The Company loans are guaranteed by its subsidiaries, and the Company has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral for the loans. The Shield Media loans are guaranteed by the Company, and the Company has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral for the loans, on a pari passu basis with the Media General credit agreement. Both sets of Senior Notes are also guaranteed by the Company and certain of LIN TV s subsidiaries on a full and unconditional basis. 
    
  The credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a leverage ratio covenant which is tested for purposes of the Revolving Loan Facility if and when the Revolver borrowings and non-collateralized letters of credit exceed $45 million at a quarter end. At other times, there is not a required maximum leverage ratio in which the Company must operate. The leverage ratio involves debt levels and a rolling eight-quarter calculation of EBITDA, as defined in the agreement if applicable. For the third quarter of 2016, the maximum ratio would have been 5.0 times if it had been in effect. Additionally, the agreement has restrictions on certain transactions that are operational regardless of Revolver borrowing level, including the incurrence of additional debt, capital leases, investments, fundamental changes (including additional acquisitions mergers or consolidations), limitation liens, prepayment or amendment of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, changes in the nature of the business, asset sales and restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases) as defined in the agreement. 
    
  The Shield Media loans have a fixed charge coverage ratio (a ratio of fixed charges (interest, debt payments, capital expenditures and taxes) to EBITDA, calculated on a rolling eight-quarter basis, as defined in the agreement). The Shield Media loans also have restrictions on transactions similar in nature to those in the new Media General credit agreement, but scaled to Shield Media s smaller size. Additionally, the Shield Media loans have more specific covenants regarding the operation of the Shield Media business and requires that each Shield Media holding company that controls a Shield Media station limit its activities to the performance of its obligations under the Shield Media credit documents, and activities incidental thereto, including owning a Shield Media station and the performance of its obligations under and activities related to the shared services agreement. The Senior Notes do not contain financial maintenance covenants, but do include restrictive covenants with respect to the ability to incur additional debt and issue disqualified stock; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; prepay, redeem or repurchase capital stock or subordinated debt; transfer or sell assets; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; create or incur liens; and merge or consolidate with any other person. The Media General and Shield Media credit agreements along with both sets of Senior Notes contain cross-default provisions. 
    
  The Company does not have material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    
  Consolidated net leverage, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, was 4.84x as of   September 30, 2016  . As noted above, the Company was not required to operate within the maximum leverage ratio as the Revolver borrowings and non-collateralized letters of credit did not exceed $45 million as of   September 30, 2016  .  

OUTLOOK 
    
  The Company owns, operates or provides services to   71   stations across   48   markets covering   23%   of U.S. TV households. While the Political spending for the year hasn't been as strong as originally anticipated, the Company s scale and location within several strongly contested states has facilitated increased cash flow.  The 2016 Summer Olympics generated a 14% increase in revenue from the 2012 Summer Olympics on a same-station basis.  Additionally, the Company grew retransmission revenue in the first nine months of 2016 and is participating in the FCC spectrum auction that is currently ongoing.  For the remainder of 2016, the Company expects to continue to generate free cash flow from Political and retransmission, however current expectations for Political are lower than originally projected. The Company continues to work with Nexstar to secure the necessary approvals to effectuate the announced merger transaction.
