   Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   

Note 1   Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Basis of Presentation    The consolidated financial statements include Porter Bancorp, Inc. (Company) and its subsidiary, PBI Bank (Bank).  The Company owns a 100% interest in the Bank. All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. A description of other significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     
   Use of Estimates        To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ.  
     
   Reclassifications    Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications did not impact net income or stockholders  equity.  
     
   Adoption of New Accounting   Standards    In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU is an update to ASU 2014-09, and delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The ASU provides guidance on revenue recognition for entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an update ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this update impact public business entities as follows: 1) Require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 2) Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 3) Eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 4) Require entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 5) Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 6) Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 7) Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a material impact.   
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).   Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting in largely unchanged. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a material impact.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a material impact.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The final standard will change estimates for credit losses related to financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and certain other contracts. For estimating credit losses, the FASB is replacing the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The largest impact will be on the allowance for loan and lease losses. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  

Note 2   Going Concern Considerations and Future Plans   
     
  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. However, the events and circumstances described in the Company s annual report filed on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2015 created substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at December 31, 2015. Since December 31, 2015, the Company has made significant improvements in its operating results, improved its liquidity position through a capital raise, brought current interest payment obligations on its junior subordinated debt in 2016, reduced non-performing assets, and reduced contingent liability risk as discussed below.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported net income of $3.9 million compared with net loss of $3.2 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our financial performance has been negatively impacted by the Bank s elevated level of non-performing assets, although the impact continues to diminish as we have substantially reduced non-performing assets during recent periods. Non-performing loans were 1.62%, 2.28%, and 7.57% of total loans at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Non-performing assets were 1.88%, 3.51%, and 9.19% of total assets at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. See  Analysis of Financial Condition,  below.  
     
  On April 15, 2016, we completed a private placement of 2.9 million common shares and 1.1 million non-voting common shares to accredited investors for a total purchase price of $5.0 million. The investors in the private placement directed a portion of the purchase price to pay all deferred interest payments on our trust preferred securities, bringing our interest payments current through the second quarter of 2016. We had deferred interest payable on the junior subordinated debentures held by our trust subsidiaries since the fourth quarter of 2011, requiring our trust subsidiaries to defer distributions on our trust preferred securities held by investors during that period. The remaining proceeds from the private placement totaled approximately $2.2 million and will be used for general corporate purposes and to support the Bank.  
     
  On June 29, 2016, we notified the trustees of our election to again defer our interest payments effective with the third quarter 2016 payment. We have the ability to defer distributions on our trust preferred securities for 20 consecutive quarters or through the second quarter of 2021. After 20 consecutive quarters, we must pay all deferred distributions or we will be in default.   
     
  We continue to be involved in various legal proceedings, which are more fully described in Note 13    Contingencies . We are appealing a judgment against us that we believe, after conferring with our legal advisors, we have meritorious grounds on which to prevail. If we do not prevail, the ultimate outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.   
     
  PBI Bank is in compliance with each element of its Consent Order with the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions ( KDFI ) other than the requirement that the Bank maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 12%. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio and total risk based capital ratio had improved to 6.97% and 11.18%, respectively, both less than the minimum capital ratios required by the Consent Order, but otherwise compliant with Basel III capital requirements. The Consent Order provides that if the Bank should be unable to reach the required capital levels, and if directed in writing by the FDIC, the Bank would be required to develop, adopt and implement a written plan to sell or merge itself into another federally insured financial institution or otherwise obtain a capital investment sufficient to recapitalize the Bank. The Bank has not been directed by the FDIC to implement such a plan.  

10

Table Of Contents 

In order to meet the 9.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12.0% total risk based capital ratio requirements of the Consent Order, the Board of Directors and management are continuing to evaluate and implement strategies to achieve the following objectives:  

Increasing capital, including through the issuance of senior debt, subordinated debt, or equity securities.      

Continuing to operate the Company and Bank in a safe and sound manner. We have reduced our lending concentrations and the size of our balance sheet while continuing to remediate non-performing loans.     

Executing on the sale of other real estate owned ( OREO ) and reinvesting the sale proceeds in quality income producing assets.     

Continuing to improve our internal processes and procedures, distribution of labor, and work-flow to ensure we have adequately and appropriately deployed resources in an efficient manner in the current environment.      
     
  Bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a consent order. Based on individual circumstances, the agencies may issue mandatory directives, impose monetary penalties, initiate changes in management, or take more serious adverse actions such as directing a bank to seek a buyer or taking a bank into receivership.  
     
  The Consent Order requires the Bank to obtain the written consent of both the FDIC and the KDFI before declaring or paying any future dividends to the Company, which are its principal source of the Company s revenue. Since the Bank is unlikely to be able to pay dividends to the Company until the Consent Order is satisfied, cash inflows for the Company are limited to the issuance of new debt or the issuance of capital securities. The Company s liquid assets were $2.2 million as of September 30, 2016. Ongoing operating expenses of the Company are forecast at approximately $1.0 million for the next twelve months.  
     
  Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result were the Company to become unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 3   Securities   
     
  The fair value of available for sale securities and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:  

Sales and calls of available for sale securities were as follows:  

The amortized cost and fair value of the debt investment securities portfolio are shown by contractual maturity. Contractual maturities may differ from actual maturities if issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Mortgage-backed securities not due at a single maturity date are detailed separately.

Table Of Contents 

Securities pledged at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 had carrying values of approximately $52.5 million and $68.0 million, respectively, and were pledged to secure public deposits.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we held securities issued by the Commonwealth of Kentucky or municipalities in the Commonwealth of Kentucky having a book value of $16.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively. Additionally, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we held securities issued by the State of Texas or municipalities in the State of Texas having a book value of $4.3 million at each period end. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no other holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders  equity.  
     
  Securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, are as follows:  

There were no held to maturity securities in an unrecognized loss position at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.   
     
  The Company evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, underlying credit quality of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the sector or industry trends and cycles affecting the issuer, and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition. Management currently intends to hold all securities with unrealized losses until recovery, which for fixed income securities may be at maturity. As of September 30, 2016, management does not believe securities within our portfolio with unrealized losses should be classified as other than temporarily impaired.

Impaired Loans   
     
  Impaired loans include restructured loans and loans on nonaccrual or classified as doubtful, whereby collection of the total amount is improbable, or loss, whereby all or a portion of the loan has been written off or a specific allowance for loss has been provided.   
     
  The following tables present information related to loans individually evaluated for impairment by class of loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Cash basis income recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $87,000 and $377,000, respectively, compared to $47,000 and $149,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
       
   Troubled Debt Restructuring   
     
  A troubled debt restructuring (TDR) occurs when the Company has agreed to a loan modification in the form of a concession for a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty. The majority of the Company s TDRs involve a reduction in interest rate, a deferral of principal for a stated period of time, or an interest only period. All TDRs are considered impaired and the Company has allocated reserves for these loans to reflect the present value of the concessionary terms granted to the borrower.  

17

Table Of Contents 

The following table presents the types of TDR loan modifications by portfolio segment outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 64% and 83%, respectively, of the Company s TDRs were performing according to their modified terms. The Company allocated $238,000 and $179,000 in reserves to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company has committed to lend no additional amounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to borrowers with outstanding loans classified as TDRs.  
     
  Management periodically reviews renewals/modifications of previously identified TDRs, for which there was no principal forgiveness, to consider if it is appropriate to remove the TDR classification. If the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty and the renewal/modification did not contain a concessionary interest rate or other concessionary terms, management considers the potential removal of the TDR classification. If deemed appropriate, the TDR classification is removed as the borrower has complied with the terms of the loan at the date of renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the renewal/modification. In this instance, the TDR was originally considered a restructuring in a prior year as a result of a modification with an interest rate that was not commensurate with the risk of the underlying loan. Additionally, TDR classification can be removed in circumstances in which the Company performs a non-concessionary re-modification of the loan at terms that were considered to be at market for loans with comparable risk. Management expects the borrower will continue to perform under the re-modified terms based on the borrower s past history of performance.

As of September 30, 2016, the TDR classification was removed from one loan that met the requirements as discussed above. This loan totaled $5.0 million at December 31, 2015. This loan is no longer evaluated individually for impairment.   
     
  No TDR loan modifications occurred during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, no TDRs defaulted on their restructured loan within the 12 month period following the loan modification. A default is considered to have occurred once the TDR is past due 90 days or more or it has been placed on nonaccrual.   
       
   Nonperforming Loans   
     
  Nonperforming loans include impaired loans not on accrual and smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage and consumer loans, that are collectively evaluated for impairment.

Credit Quality Indicators    
     
  We categorize all loans into risk categories at origination based upon original underwriting. Thereafter, we categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends. Additionally, loans are analyzed regularly through our internal and external loan review processes. Borrower relationships in excess of $500,000 are routinely analyzed through our credit administration processes which classify the loans as to credit risk. The following definitions are used for risk ratings:  
     
   Watch    Loans   classified as watch are those loans which have experienced a potentially adverse development which necessitates increased monitoring.  
     
   Special Mention    Loans classified as special mention do not have all of the characteristics of substandard or doubtful loans. They have one or more deficiencies which warrant special attention and which corrective action, such as accelerated collection practices, may remedy.  
     
   Substandard    Loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position, unfavorable financial ratios, uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition which may jeopardize the repayment of the debt as contractually agreed. They are characterized by the distinct possibility we will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected.  
        
   Doubtful    Loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable.

Note 5   Other Real Estate Owned   
     
  Other real estate owned (OREO) is real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. It is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. When property is acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, it is recorded at its fair market value less cost to sell. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred in order to perfect the lien prior to foreclosure may be capitalized if the fair value less the cost to sell exceeds the balance of the loan at the time of transfer to OREO. Examples of eligible costs to be capitalized are payments of delinquent property taxes to clear tax liens or payments to contractors and subcontractors to clear mechanics  liens. Subsequent reductions in fair value are recorded as non-interest expense.    
     
  To determine the fair value of OREO for smaller dollar single family homes, we consult with internal real estate sales staff and external realtors, investors, and appraisers. If the internally evaluated market price is below our underlying investment in the property, appropriate write-downs are taken. For larger dollar residential and commercial real estate properties, we obtain a new appraisal of the subject property or have staff from our special assets group or in our centralized appraisal department evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to other real estate owned. We typically obtain updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent.

Each advance is payable based upon the terms of agreement, with a prepayment penalty. New advances are limited to a one-year maturity or less. No prepayment penalties were incurred during 2016 or 2015. The advances are collateralized by first mortgage loans. The borrowing capacity is based on the market value of the underlying pledged loans. At September 30, 2016, our additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $27.7 million. The availability of our borrowing capacity could be affected by our financial condition and the FHLB could require additional collateral or, among other things, exercise its right to deny a funding request, at its discretion.

Note 8   Fair Values Measurement   
     
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, including market, income and cost approaches. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:  
     
   Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets an entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date, or observable inputs.  
       
   Level 2:  Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  
     
   Level 3:  Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  
        
  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. When that occurs, we classify the fair value hierarchy on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value.  
     
   Securities:  The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges, if available. This valuation method is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated on market prices of similar securities, or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Matrix pricing relies on the securities  relationship to similarly traded securities, benchmark curves, and the benchmarking of like securities. Matrix pricing utilizes observable market inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. In instances where broker quotes are used, these quotes are obtained from market makers or broker-dealers recognized to be market participants. This valuation method is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators.   This valuation method is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Discounted cash flows are calculated using spread to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate loss severities, volatility, credit spread and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model.   Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations.  
     
   Impaired Loans:  An impaired loan is evaluated at the time the loan is identified as impaired and is recorded at fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loan and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value is determined using several methods. Generally, the fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.   
     
  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. These routine adjustments are made to adjust the value of a specific property relative to comparable properties for variations in qualities such as location, size, and income production capacity relative to the subject property of the appraisal. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.   
     
  We routinely apply an internal discount to the value of appraisals used in the fair value evaluation of our impaired loans. The deductions to the appraisal take into account changing business factors and market conditions, as well as potential value impairment in cases where our appraisal date predates a likely change in market conditions. These deductions range from 10% for routine real estate collateral to 25% for real estate that is determined (1) to have a thin trading market or (2) to be specialized collateral. This is in addition to estimated discounts for cost to sell of six to ten percent.  
     
  We also apply discounts to the expected fair value of collateral for impaired loans where the likely resolution involves litigation or foreclosure. Resolution of this nature generally results in receiving lower values for real estate collateral in a more aggressive sales environment. We have utilized discounts ranging from 10% to 33% in our impairment evaluations when applicable.  

24

Table Of Contents 

Impaired loans are evaluated quarterly for additional impairment. We obtain updated appraisals on properties securing our loans when circumstances are warranted such as at the time of renewal or when market conditions have significantly changed. This determination is made on a property-by-property basis in light of circumstances in the broader economic climate and our assessment of deterioration of real estate values in the market in which the property is located. The first stage of our assessment involves management s inspection of the property in question. Management also engages in conversations with local real estate professionals, investors, and market participants to determine the likely marketing time and value range for the property. The second stage involves an assessment of current trends in the regional market. After thorough consideration of these factors, management will either internally evaluate fair value or order a new appraisal.   
       
   Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) : OREO is evaluated at the time of acquisition and recorded at fair value as determined by independent appraisal or internal evaluation less cost to sell. Our quarterly evaluations of OREO for impairment are driven by property type. For smaller dollar single family homes, we consult with internal real estate sales staff and external realtors, investors, and appraisers. Based on these consultations, we determine asking prices for OREO properties we are marketing for sale. If the internally evaluated fair value is below our recorded investment in the property, appropriate write-downs are taken.  
     
  For larger dollar commercial real estate properties, we obtain a new appraisal of the subject property or have staff in our special assets group or centralized appraisal department evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to other real estate owned. In some of these circumstances, an appraisal is in process at quarter end, and we must make our best estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral based on our internal evaluation of the property, review of the most recent appraisal, and discussions with the currently engaged appraiser. We generally obtain updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent.  
     
  We routinely apply an internal discount to the value of appraisals used in the fair value evaluation of our OREO. The deductions to the appraisal take into account changing business factors and market conditions, as well as potential value impairment in cases where our appraisal date predates a likely change in market conditions. These deductions range from 10% for routine real estate collateral to 25% for real estate that is determined (1) to have a thin trading market or (2) to be specialized collateral. This is in addition to estimated discounts for cost to sell of six to ten percent.

At September 30, 2015, our other debt security valuation was determined internally by calculating discounted cash flows using the security s coupon rate of 6.5% and an estimated current market rate of 8.25% based upon the current yield curve plus spreads that adjust for volatility, credit risk, and optionality. We also considered the issuer s publicly filed financial information as well as assumptions regarding the likelihood of deferrals and defaults. This security was sold in December 2015.

Table Of Contents 

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows:  
     
   (a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   
  The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2. Non-interest bearing deposits are Level 1 whereas interest bearing due from bank accounts and fed funds sold are Level 2.  
     
   (b) FHLB Stock   
  It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.  
     
   (c) Loans, Net   
  Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.  
     
   (d) Loans Held for Sale   
  The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and and/or quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
     
   (e) Deposits   
  The fair values disclosed for non-interest bearing deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification. The carrying amounts of variable rate interest bearing deposits approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 2 classification. Fair values for fixed rate interest bearing deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
     
    (   f) Other Borrowings   
  The fair values of the Company s FHLB advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
     
  The fair values of the Company s subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.  
     
   (g) Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable   
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification based on the level of the asset or liability with which the accrual is associated.

Note 9   Income Taxes   
     
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities were due to the following as of:  

Our estimate of our ability to realize the deferred tax asset depends on our estimate of projected future levels of taxable income. In analyzing future taxable income levels, we considered all evidence currently available, both positive and negative. Based on our analysis, we established a valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011. The valuation allowance remains in effect as of September 30, 2016.   
     
  The Company does not have any beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months. There were no interest and penalties recorded in the income statement or accrued for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015 related to unrecognized tax benefits.  
     
  Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended ( Section 382 ), the Company s net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) and other deferred tax assets can generally be used to offset future taxable income and therefore reduce federal income tax obligations. However, the Company's ability to use its NOLs would be limited if there was an  ownership change  as defined by Section 382. This would occur if shareholders owning (or deemed to own under the tax rules) 5% or more of the Company's increase their aggregate ownership of the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a defined period of time.  
     
  In 2015, the Company took two measures to preserve the value of its NOLs. First, we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan designed to reduce the likelihood of an  ownership change  occurring as a result of purchases and sales of the Company's common shares. Upon adoption of this plan, the Company declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each common share outstanding as of the close of business on July 10, 2015. Any shareholder or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the Company (an  acquiring person ) could be subject to significant dilution in its holdings if the Company's Board of Directors does not approve such acquisition. Existing shareholders holding 5% or more of the Company will not be considered acquiring persons unless they acquire additional shares, subject to certain exceptions described in the plan. In addition, the Board of Directors has the discretion to exempt certain transactions and certain persons whose acquisition of securities is determined by the Board not to jeopardize the Company's deferred tax assets. The rights will expire upon the earlier of (i) June 29, 2018, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year with respect to which the Board of Directors determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward, (iii) the repeal or amendment of Section 382 or any successor statute, if the Board of Directors determines that the plan is no longer needed to preserve the tax benefits, and (iv) certain other events as described in the plan.  
     
  On September 23, 2015, our shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s articles of incorporation to further help protect the long-term value of the Company s NOLs. The amendment provides a means to block transfers of our common shares that could result in an ownership change under Section 382. The transfer restrictions will expire on the earlier of (i) September 23, 2018, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year with respect to which the Board of Directors determines that no tax benefit may be carried forward, (iii) the repeal of Section 382 or any successor statute if our Board determines that the transfer restrictions are no longer needed to preserve the tax benefits of our NOLs, or (iv) such date as the Board otherwise determines that the transfer restrictions are no longer necessary.

   Note 10   Stock Plans and Stock Based Compensation   
     
  At the annual meeting on May 25, 2016, shareholders approved the Porter Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan ( 2016 Plan ), which replaces the Porter Bancorp, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2006 Employee Plan ) that had expired earlier in 2016. The shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan total 232,512 shares which represents the number of shares that had previously been authorized by shareholders for issuance under the 2006 Employee Plan. Shares issued to employees under the plan vest annually on the anniversary date of the grant over three to ten years.  
     
  The Company also maintains the Porter Bancorp, Inc. 2006 Non-Employee Directors Stock Ownership Incentive Plan ( 2006 Director Plan ) pursuant to which 89,622 shares remain available for issuance as annual awards of restricted stock to the Company s non-employee directors. Shares issued annually to non-employee directors have a fair market value of $25,000 and vest on December 31 in the year of grant.  
     
  On December 4, 2014, the U.S. Treasury sold our Series A preferred shares at a discount to face amount. As a result, restricted shares previously granted to senior executives became subject to permanent transfer restrictions. On March 25, 2015, the Compensation Committee modified the equity compensation arrangements with our four named executive officers to restore the incentive that was intended by including equity grants in their employment agreements. The Compensation Committee and our four named executive officers mutually agreed to terminate 538,479 restricted shares that were subject to permanent restrictions on transfer. We then awarded 800,000 new service-based restricted shares to those executive officers. The new awards are accounted for as a modification and vest over four years, with one-third of the shares vesting on each of the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. The modification resulted in incremental compensation expense of approximately $233,000, which is being amortized in accordance with the vesting schedule.  
     
  The fair value of the 2016 unvested shares issued was $323,000, or $1.82 per weighted-average share. The Company recorded $148,000 and $315,000 of stock-based compensation to salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $132,000 and $313,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. We expect substantially all of the unvested shares outstanding at the end of the period will vest according to the vesting schedule. No deferred tax benefit was recognized related to this expense for either period.  
     
  The following table summarizes unvested share activity as of and for the periods indicated for the Stock Incentive Plan:  

Unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested shares for the remainder of 2016 and beyond is estimated as follows (in thousands):

Note 11   Earnings (Loss) per Share   
     
  The factors used in the basic and diluted loss per share computations follow:  

The Company had no outstanding stock options at September 30, 2016 or 2015. A warrant for the purchase of 330,561 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $15.88 was outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015 but was not included in the diluted EPS computation as inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.   
     
   Note 12   Capital Requirements and Restrictions on Retained Earnings   
     
  Banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action.   
     
  The final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The final rules allowed banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. The Company and the Bank opted out of this requirement. The rules also establish a  capital conservation buffer  of 2.5%, to be phased in over three years, above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. Once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the minimum ratios are a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement begins in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.       
     
  In its Consent Order with the FDIC and the KDFI, the Bank has agreed to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 12%. The Consent Order is described in greater detail in Note 2    Going Concern and Future Plans . As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio and total risk based capital ratio were both less than the minimum capital ratios required by the Consent Order, but otherwise compliant with Basel III capital requirements. The Bank cannot be considered well-capitalized while subject to the Consent Order. We are also restricted from accepting, renewing, or rolling-over brokered deposits without the prior receipt of a waiver on a case-by-case basis from our regulators.

On September 21, 2011, we entered into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In the Agreement, we made formal commitments to use our financial and management resources to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and to assist the Bank in addressing weaknesses identified by the FDIC and the KDFI, to pay no dividends without prior written approval, to pay no interest or principal on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without prior written approval, and to submit an acceptable plan to maintain sufficient capital.  
     
  The following table shows the ratios and amounts of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-adjusted assets and the leverage ratios for Porter Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

The Consent Order requires the Bank to achieve the minimum capital ratios presented below:  

Bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a Consent Order. Based on individual circumstances, the agencies may issue mandatory directives, impose monetary penalties, initiate changes in management, or take more serious adverse actions.     
     
  Kentucky banking laws limit the dividends that may be paid to a holding company by its subsidiary banks without prior approval. These laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is the current year s net income, as defined in the laws, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, less any dividends declared during those periods. The Bank has agreed with its primary regulators to obtain their written consent prior to declaring or paying any future dividends. As a practical matter, the Bank cannot pay dividends to the Company while subject to the Consent Order.  
       
   Note 13   Contingencies   
     
  We are defendants in various legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain.  Currently, we have accrued approximately $2.1 million related to ongoing litigation matters for which we believe liability is probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals are not made in cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. We disclose legal matters when we believe liability is reasonably possible and may be material to our consolidated financial statements.  
     
    Signature Point Litigation.   On June 18, 2010, three real estate development companies filed suit in Kentucky state court against the Bank and Managed Assets of Kentucky ( MAKY ).  Signature Point Condominiums LLC, et al. v. PBI Bank, et al ., Jefferson Circuit Court, Case No 10-CI-04295. On July 16, 2013, a jury in Louisville, Kentucky returned a verdict against the Bank, awarding the plaintiffs compensatory damages of $1,515,000 and punitive damages of $5,500,000. The case arose from a settlement in which the Bank agreed to release the plaintiffs and guarantors from obligations of more than $26 million related to a real estate project in Louisville. The plaintiffs were granted a right of first refusal to repurchase a tract of land within the project. In exchange, the plaintiffs conveyed the real estate securing the loans to the Bank. After plaintiffs declined to exercise their right of first refusal, the Bank sold the tract to the third party. Plaintiffs alleged the Bank had knowledge of the third party offer before the conveyance of the land by the Plaintiffs to the Bank. Plaintiffs asserted claims of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with prospective business advantage and conspiracy to commit fraud, negligence, and conspiracy against the Bank.  
     
  After conferring with its legal advisors, the Bank believes the findings and damages are excessive and contrary to law, and that it has meritorious grounds on which it has moved to appeal. The Bank s Notice of Appeal was filed on October 25, 2013. After a number of procedural issues were resolved, the Bank filed its appellate brief on September 30, 2014. Appellee s brief was filed on December 1, 2014. The Appellate Court heard oral arguments on November 16, 2015. We await the Appellate Court s ruling. We will continue to defend this matter vigorously.  
     
  In accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 450-20-25, and after consultation with its legal counsel engaged for the appeal of the verdict, the Company concluded that it was not probable the full amount of the compensatory damages awarded by the jury would be overturned. Therefore, a liability was accrued for the full $1.5 million of compensatory damages awarded, plus statutory interest. After conferring with its legal counsel for the appeal, the Company concluded that the jury verdict for punitive damages was contrary to law, unsupported, excessive, and otherwise inappropriate. Based on this advice, the Company concluded it was probable that the verdict amount for $5.5 million in punitive damages would be overturned by the appeals court, and therefore it was not probable that the $5.5 million in punitive damages would become an actual liability. The ultimate outcome of this self-insured matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

AIT Laboratories Employee Stock Ownership Plan.   On August 29, 2014, the United States Department of Labor ( DOL ) filed a lawsuit against the Bank and Michael A. Evans in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  Thomas E. Perez, Secretary of the United States Department of Labor v. PBI Bank, Inc. and Michael A. Evans  (Case No. 1:14-CV-01429-SEB-MJD). The complaint alleged that in 2009, the Bank, in the capacity of trustee for the AIT Laboratories Employee Stock Ownership Plan, authorized the alleged imprudent and disloyal purchase of the stock of AIT Holdings, Inc. in 2009 for $90 million, a price allegedly far in excess of the stock s fair market value. On May 12, 2016, the parties agreed to settle the litigation and executed a written settlement agreement. The Bank agreed to a settlement payment, which, to the extent not paid from insurance proceeds, had been previously reserved for. The court entered an agreed order ending the litigation on May 13, 2016.  
         
    United States Department of Justice Investigation.   On October 17, 2014, the United States Department of Justice (the  DOJ ) notified the Bank that the Bank was the subject of an investigation into possible violations of federal laws, including, among other things, possible violations related to false bank entries, bank fraud and securities fraud.  The investigation concerns allegations that Bank personnel engaged in practices intended to delay or avoid disclosure of the Bank s asset quality at the time of and following the United States Treasury s purchase of preferred shares from the Company in November 2008.  The Bank is responding to and cooperating with any requests for information from DOJ. At this time the investigation is ongoing, and DOJ has made no determination whether to pursue any action in the matter.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
     
  This item analyzes our financial condition, change in financial condition and results of operations. It should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented in Part I, Item 1 of this report.  
     
   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  This report contains statements about the future expectations, activities and events that constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements express our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future financial and operating performance and growth plans, taking into account information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. The words  believe,   may,   should,   anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   objective,   seek,   plan,   strive  or similar words, or the negatives of these words, identify forward-looking statements.  
     
  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties can be difficult to predict and may be out of our control. Factors that could contribute to differences in our results include, but are not limited to the following:  

Our inability to increase our capital to the levels required by our agreements with bank regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business.     

A significant percentage of our loan portfolio is comprised of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, real estate construction and development loans, and multi-family residential real estate loans, all of which carry a higher degree of risk.      

We continue to hold and acquire a significant amount of other real estate owned ( OREO ) properties, which could increase operating expenses and result in future losses.     

Our decisions regarding credit risk may not be accurate, and our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses.     

Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common and preferred shares and pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures that relate to our trust preferred securities is currently restricted. Our inability to resume paying interest on our trust preferred securities could adversely affect our common and preferred shareholders.     

While we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate, the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates.     
     
  We also refer you to Part II, Item 1A   Risk Factors in this report and to the risks identified and the cautionary statements discussed in greater detail in our December 31, 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     
  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results. A forward-looking statement may include a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying the forward-looking statement. The Company believes it has chosen these assumptions and bases in good faith and they are reasonable. We caution you however, forward looking statements relying upon such assumptions or bases almost always vary from actual results, and the differences between those statements and actual results can be material. The forward-looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of the report.  We have no duty, and do not intend to, update these statements unless applicable laws require us to do so.  
     
   Overview

We serve south central Kentucky and southern Kentucky from banking offices in Butler, Green, Hart, Edmonson, Barren, Warren, Ohio, and Daviess Counties. We also have an office in Lexington, the second largest city in Kentucky. The Bank is a community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products.

Table Of Contents 

The Company reported net income of $1.4 million and $3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net loss of $1.1 million and $2.6 million for the same periods of 2015. After deductions for earnings allocated to participating securities, net income available to common shareholders was $1.3 million and $3.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with net loss attributable to common shareholders of $1.0 million and $2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
  Basic and diluted net income per common share were $0.04 and $0.13 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with basic and diluted net loss per common share of ($0.04) and ($0.10) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
  We note the following significant items during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

On April 15, 2016, we completed the private placement of 2.9 million common shares and 1.1 million non-voting common shares to accredited investors resulting in total proceeds of $5.0 million. The investors in the private placement directed a portion of purchase price to pay all deferred interest payments on junior subordinated debentures, bringing our interest payments current through the second quarter of 2016. The remaining proceeds totaled approximately $2.2 million and will be used for general corporate purposes and to support the Bank.     

We recorded negative provision for loan losses expense of $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, because of declining historical loss rates, improvements in loan quality, and management s assessment of risk in the loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs were $652,000 for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $3.0 million for the first nine months of 2015. In the following paragraphs we discuss our improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories during the period, the factors that led to the negative provision expense.      

All loan risk categories (other than pass loans) have decreased since December 31, 2015. Pass loans represent 88.6% of the portfolio at September   30, 2016, compared to 83.6% at December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September   30, 2016, the pass category increased approximately $33.6 million, the watch category declined approximately $17.3 million, the special mention category declined approximately $792,000, and the substandard category declined approximately $12.5 million. The $12.5 million decrease in loans classified as substandard was primarily driven by $7.9 million in principal payments received and $8.1 million in loans upgraded from substandard, offset by $6.7 million in loans downgraded to substandard during the nine months ended September   30, 2016.

Average loans receivable declined approximately $19.7 million or 3.1% to $621.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $641.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This resulted in an interest revenue volume decline of approximately $726,000. The decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily driven by the continued repricing of certificates of deposit at lower rates and the declining volume of certificates of deposit.      

Going Concern Considerations and Future Plans      
     
  As described in Note 2    Going Concern Considerations and Future Plans,  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. However, the events and circumstances described in the Company s annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 created substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at December 31, 2015. Since December 31, 2015, we have made significant improvements in our operating results, improved our liquidity position through a capital raise, brought current interest payment obligations on our junior subordinated debt in 2016, reduced non-performing assets, and reduced contingent liability risk as described below.  
       
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported net income of $3.9 million compared with net loss of $3.2 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our financial performance has been negatively impacted by the Bank s elevated level of non-performing assets, although the impact continues to diminish as we have substantially reduced non-performing assets during recent periods. Non-performing loans were 1.62%, 2.28%, and 7.57% of total loans at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Non-performing assets were 1.88%, 3.51%, and 9.19% of total assets at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. See  Analysis of Financial Condition,  below.  
     
  On April 15, 2016, we completed a private placement of 2.9 million common shares and 1.1 million non-voting common shares to accredited investors for a total purchase price of $5.0 million. The investors in the private placement directed a portion of the purchase price to pay all deferred interest payments on our trust preferred securities, bringing our interest payments current through the second quarter of 2016. We had deferred interest payable on the junior subordinated debentures held by our trust subsidiaries since the fourth quarter of 2011, requiring our trust subsidiaries to defer distributions on our trust preferred securities held by investors during that period. The remaining proceeds from the private placement totaled approximately $2.2 million and will be used for general corporate purposes and to support the Bank.  
     
  On June 29, 2016, we notified the trustees of our election to again defer our interest payments effective with the third quarter 2016 payment. We have the ability to defer distributions on our trust preferred securities for 20 consecutive quarters or through the second quarter of 2021. After 20 consecutive quarters, we must pay all deferred distributions or we will be in default.   
     
  We continue to be involved in various legal proceedings, which are more fully described in Note 13    Contingencies . We are appealing a judgment against us that we believe, after conferring with our legal advisors, we have meritorious grounds on which to prevail. If we do not prevail, the ultimate outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.     
     
  PBI Bank is in compliance with each element of its Consent Order with the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions other than the requirement that the Bank maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 12%. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio and total risk based capital ratio had improved 6.97% and 11.18%, respectively, both less than the minimum capital ratios required by the Consent Order, but otherwise compliant with Basel III capital requirements. The Consent Order provides that if the Bank should be unable to reach the required capital levels, and if directed in writing by the FDIC, the Bank would be required to develop, adopt and implement a written plan to sell or merge itself into another federally insured financial institution or otherwise obtain a capital investment sufficient to recapitalize the Bank. The Bank has not been directed by the FDIC to implement such a plan.

Table Of Contents 

In order to meet the 9.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12.0% total risk based capital ratio requirements of the Consent Order, the Board of Directors and management are continuing to evaluate and implement strategies to achieve the following objectives:  

Increasing capital, including through the issuance of senior debt, subordinated debt, or equity securities.      

Continuing to operate the Company and Bank in a safe and sound manner.  We have reduced our lending concentrations and the size of our balance sheet while continuing to remediate non-performing loans.      

Executing on the sale of OREO and reinvesting the sale proceeds in quality income producing assets.     

Continuing to improve our internal processes and procedures, distribution of labor, and work-flow to ensure we have adequately and appropriately deployed resources in an efficient manner in the current environment.      
     
  Bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a consent order. Based on individual circumstances, the agencies may issue mandatory directives, impose monetary penalties, initiate changes in management, or take more serious adverse actions.  
     
  The Consent Order requires the Bank to obtain the written consent of both the FDIC and the KDFI before declaring or paying any future dividends to the Company, which are its principal source of the Company s revenue. Since the Bank is unlikely to be able to pay dividends to the Company until the Consent Order is satisfied, cash inflows for the Company are limited to the issuance of new debt or the issuance of capital securities. The Company s liquid assets were $2.2 million at September 30, 2016. Ongoing operating expenses of the Company are forecast at approximately $1.0 million for the next twelve months.   
     
  Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result were the Company to become unable to continue as a going concern.  
        
   Application of Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  We continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures. Our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements are summarized in  Application of Critical Accounting Policies  in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calendar year ended December 31, 2015.   Management has discussed the development, selection, and application of our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee. During the first nine months of 2016, there were no material changes in the critical accounting policies and assumptions.  
       
   Results of Operations   
     
  The following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the same period of 2015:  

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1.4 million, compared with net loss of $1.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. Net interest income decreased $24,000 from the third quarter of 2015 as a result of a decrease in earning assets, offset by an increase in net interest margin. Net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 3.47% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 3.33% in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in margin between periods was due to an increase in the yield on earning assets from 4.07% for the third quarter of 2015 to 4.15% for the third quarter of 2016, coupled with a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.83% in the third quarter of 2015 to 0.78% in the third quarter of 2016. Average earning assets decreased from $903.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $864.3 for the third quarter of 2016. Non-interest income decreased by $1.1 million to $1.1 million from $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2015 was positively impacted by an $833,000 gain on extinguishment of junior subordinated debt. Non-interest expense decreased from $13.0 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to a decrease in OREO expense of $4.8 million commensurate with the significant reduction in foreclosed properties, and a $246,000 decline in professional fees.

The following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the same period of 2015:  

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $3.9 million, compared with net loss of $2.6 million for the comparable period of 2015. Net interest income increased $194,000 from the first nine months of 2015 as a result of the positive impact of the collection of previously charged-off accrued uncollected interest of approximately $377,000 during the first nine months 2016, offset by a decrease in earning assets for the first nine months of 2016. Net interest margin increased 20 basis points to 3.45% in the first nine months of 2016 compared with 3.25% in the first nine months of 2015. The increase in margin between periods was due to an increase in the yield on earning assets from 4.03% for the first nine months of 2015 to 4.14% for the first nine months of 2016, coupled with a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.87% in the first nine months of 2015 to 0.79% in the first nine months of 2016. Average earning assets decreased from $923.3 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $874.2 million for the first nine months of 2016. Non-interest income decreased by $2.8 million to $3.6 million from $6.5 million in the first nine months of 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net gain on sales of securities of $1.5 million. Also, non-interest income for the first nine months of 2015 was positively impacted by an $883,000 gain on extinguishment of junior subordinated debt. Non-interest expense decreased from $33.4 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $23.9 million in the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to a decrease in OREO expense of $7.5 million commensurate with the significant reduction in foreclosed properties, a $1.1 million decline in professional fees, and a decline in loan collection expense of $320,000.   
         
    Net Interest In    come     Our net interest income was $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $24,000, or 0.3%, compared with $7.5 million for the same period in 2015. Net interest spread and margin were 3.37% and 3.47%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016, compared with 3.24% and 3.33%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015. Net average non-accrual loans were $11.0 million and $26.0 million for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
     
  Average loans receivable declined approximately $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015. This resulted in an interest revenue volume decline of approximately $170,000 as well as a decline in interest recoveries and rate improvements aggregating $26,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior year period. Interest foregone on non-accrual loans totaled $180,000 in the third quarter of 2016, compared with $181,000 in the second quarter of 2016, and $352,000 in the third quarter of 2015.   
     
  Net interest margin increased 14 basis points from our margin of 3.33% in the prior year third quarter to 3.47% for the third quarter of 2016. The yield on earning assets increased eight basis points and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined five basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily driven by declines in the average rates paid on and volume declines in certificates of deposit between periods.   
       
  Net interest income was $22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $194,000, or 0.1%, compared with $22.1 million for the same period in 2015. Net interest spread and margin were 3.35% and 3.45%, respectively, for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 3.16% and 3.25%, respectively, for the first nine months of 2015. Net average non-accrual loans were $12.0 million and $34.5 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cost of funds decreased eight basis points from 0.87% for the first nine months of 2015 to 0.79% for the first nine months of 2016.   
     
  Average loans receivable declined approximately $19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the first nine months of 2015. This resulted in a decline in interest revenue of approximately $726,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior year period.   
  Net interest margin increased 20 basis points from our margin of 3.25% in the first nine months of 2015. The yield on earning assets increased 11 basis points from the first nine months of 2015, compared with a 8 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily driven by declines in the average rates paid on and volume declines in and certificates of deposit between periods.

Rate/Volume Analysis   
     
   The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume); (2) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate); and (3) changes in rate-volume (change in rate multiplied by change in volume). Changes in rate-volume are proportionately allocated between rate and volume variance.  

Non-Interest Income     The following table presents the major categories of non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $1.1 million, or 50.0%, compared with the third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income decreased by $2.8 million, or 43.6% to $3.6 million compared with $6.5 million for the same period of 2015. The decrease in non-interest income between the three month comparative periods was primarily due to the $883,000 gain on extinguishment of junior subordinated debt recognized in the third quarter of 2015, as well as a decrease of $334,000 in OREO rental income as income producing properties have been sold. The decrease in non-interest income between the nine month comparative periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in net gain on sales of investment securities, a decrease in OREO income, and the $883,000 gain on extinguishment of junior subordinated debt recognized in the third quarter of 2015.

Non-interest Expense       The following table presents the major categories of non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Non-interest expense for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased $5.0 million, or 38.9%, compared with the third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense decreased $9.4 million, or 28.3% to $23.9 million compared with $33.4 million for the first nine months of 2015. The decreases in non-interest expense for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to decreased OREO expenses commensurate with the significant reduction in foreclosed properties, as well as decreased professional fees.  
     
    Income Tax Expense             Effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 35% applied to income before income taxes due to the following:  

Analysis of Financial Condition   
     
  Total assets decreased $33.4 million, or 3.5%, to $915.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $948.7 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $29.5 million which funded the redemption of interest bearing deposits of $27.8 million. There was also a decrease in OREO of $12.1 million, offset by an increase in net loans of $5.6 million and an increase in bank owned life insurance of $5.3 million.  
     
    Loans Rec    eivable       Loans receivable increased $3.0 million, or 0.5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $621.7 million as loan growth outpaced payoffs.

Loan Portfolio Composition       The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated, net of deferred loan fees, by type. There are no foreign loans in our portfolio. Except for commercial real estate and 1-4 family residential real estate, there is no concentration of loans in any industry exceeding 10% of total loans,   with the exception of loans for retail facilities (included in nonfarm nonresidential commercial real estate below). Those loans totaled $64.4 million at September 30, 2016 and $59.1 million at December 31, 2015.  

Loan Portfolio by Risk Category     The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated, by risk category.  

Our loans receivable have increased $3.0 million, or 0.5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Except for the pass loan category, all loan risk categories have decreased since December 31, 2015. The pass category increased approximately $33.6 million, the watch category decreased approximately $17.3 million, the special mention category declined approximately $792,000, and the substandard category declined approximately $12.5 million. The $12.5 million decrease in loans classified as substandard was primarily driven by $8.1 million in loans upgraded from substandard, $7.9 million in principal payments received, $1.2 million in migration to OREO, and $1.9 million in charge-offs, offset by $6.7 million in loans moved to substandard during the period.  
         
    Loan Delinquency     The following table presents a summary of loan delinquencies at the dates indicated.

Table Of Contents 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, nonaccrual loans decreased by $4.0 million to $10.1 million. This decrease was due primarily to $4.0 million in paydowns, $1.3 million in charge offs, $751,000 in loans returned to accrual status and $1.2 million in loans migrating to OREO, offset by $3.3 million in loans being placed on nonaccrual during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, loans past due 30-59 days decreased from $3.1 million at December 31, 2015 to $2.3 million. Loans past due 60-89 days increased from $241,000 at December 31, 2015 to $273,000 at September 30, 2016. This represents a $766,000 decrease from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, in loans past due 30-89 days. We considered this trend in delinquency levels during the evaluation of qualitative trends in the portfolio when establishing the general component of our allowance for loan losses.  
         
    Non-Performing Assets       Non-performing assets consist of loans past due 90 days or more still on accrual, loans on which interest is no longer accrued, real estate acquired through foreclosure, and repossessed assets. The following table sets forth information with respect to non-performing assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016, were $10.1 million, or 1.62% of total loans, compared with $14.1 million, or 2.28% of total loans at December 31, 2015, and $17.0 million, or 2.72% of total loans at September 30, 2015.   
     
    Troubled Debt Restructuring    -  A troubled debt restructuring (TDR) occurs when the Company has agreed to a loan modification in the form of a concession for a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty. The majority of the Company s TDRs involve a reduction in interest rate, a deferral of principal for a stated period of time, or an interest only period. All TDRs are considered impaired, and the Company has allocated reserves for these loans to reflect the present value of the concessionary terms granted to the borrower. If the loan is considered collateral dependent, it is reported net of allocated reserves, at the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell.  
     
  We do not have a formal loan modification program. Rather, we work with individual borrowers on a case-by-case basis to facilitate the orderly collection of our principal and interest before a loan becomes a non-performing loan. If a borrower is unable to make contractual payments, we review the particular circumstances of the borrower s situation and negotiate a revised payment stream. In other words, we identify performing borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, and through negotiations, we lower their interest rate, most typically on a short-term basis for three to six months. Our goal when restructuring a credit is to afford the borrower a reasonable period of time to remedy the issue causing cash flow constraints within their business so they can return to performing status over time.  
     
  Our loan modifications have taken the form of reduction in interest rate and/or curtailment of scheduled principal payments for a short-term period, usually three to six months, but in some cases until maturity of the loan. In some circumstances we restructure real estate secured loans in a bifurcated fashion whereby we have a fully amortizing  A  loan at a market interest rate and an interest-only  B  loan at a reduced interest rate. Our restructured loans are all collateral secured loans. If a borrower fails to perform under the modified terms, we place the loan(s) on nonaccrual status and begin the process of working with the borrower to liquidate the underlying collateral to satisfy the debt.  
     
  We consider any loan that is restructured for a borrower experiencing financial difficulties due to a borrower s potential inability to pay in accordance with contractual terms to be a troubled debt restructure. Specifically, we consider a concession involving a modification of the loan terms, such as (i) a reduction of the stated interest rate, (ii) reduction or deferral of principal, or (iii) reduction or deferral of accrued interest at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk all to be troubled debt restructurings. When a modification of terms is made for a competitive reason, we do not consider that to be a troubled debt restructuring.  A primary example of a competitive modification would be an interest rate reduction for a performing borrower s loan to a market rate as the result of a market decline in rates.

Table Of Contents 

Management periodically reviews renewals/modifications of previously identified TDRs for which there was no principal forgiveness, to consider if it is appropriate to remove the TDR classification. If the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty and the renewal/modification did not contain a concessionary interest rate or other concessionary terms, management considers the potential removal of the TDR classification. If deemed appropriate, the TDR classification is removed as the borrower has complied with the terms of the loan at the date of renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan after the date of the renewal/modification. In this instance, the TDR was originally considered a restructuring in a prior year as a result of a modification with an interest rate that was not commensurate with the risk of the underlying loan. Additionally, TDR classification can be removed in circumstances in which the Company performs a non-concessionary re-modification of the loan at terms that were considered to be at market for loans with comparable risk. Management expects the borrower will continue to perform under the re-modified terms based on the borrower s past history of performance.   
     
  If the borrower fails to perform, we place the loan on nonaccrual status and seek to liquidate the underlying collateral for these loans. Our nonaccrual policy for restructured loans is identical to our nonaccrual policy for all loans. Our policy calls for a loan to be reported as nonaccrual if it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, payment in full of principal and interest is not expected, or principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the assets are both well secured and in the process of collection. Changes in value for impairment, including the amount attributed to the passage of time, are recorded entirely within the provision for loan losses. Upon determination that a loan is collateral dependent, the loan is charged down to the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, we had 18 restructured loans totaling $9.5 million with borrowers who experienced deterioration in financial condition compared with 30 loans totaling $21.0 million at December 31, 2015. In general, these loans were granted interest rate reductions to provide cash flow relief to borrowers experiencing cash flow difficulties. Of these loans, three loans totaling approximately $3.3 million were also granted principal payment deferrals until maturity. There were no concessions made to forgive principal relative to these loans, although we have recorded partial charge-offs for certain restructured loans. In general, these loans are secured by first liens on 1-4 residential or commercial real estate properties, or farmland. Restructured loans also include $472,000 of commercial loans. At September 30, 2016, $6.1 million of our restructured loans were accruing and $3.4 million were on nonaccrual compared with $17.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. There were no new TDRs during the first nine months of 2016 or 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, TDRs were reduced as a result of $6.5 million in payments. In addition, the TDR classification was removed from one loan that met the requirements as discussed above. This loan totaled $5.0 million at December 31, 2015. This loan is no longer evaluated individually for impairment.   
     
  The following table sets forth information with respect to TDRs, non-performing loans, real estate acquired through foreclosure, and other repossessed assets.   

See  Note 4 - Loans,  of the notes to the financial statements for additional disclosure related to troubled debt restructuring.  
     
    Allowance for Loan Losses       The allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of individual loans, loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various categories of loans and such other factors that, in management s judgment, require consideration in estimating loan losses.  
     
  Management has established loan grading procedures that result in specific allowance allocations for any estimated inherent risk of loss. For loans not individually evaluated, a general allowance allocation is computed using factors developed over time based on actual loss experience. The specific and general allocations plus consideration of qualitative factors represent management s best estimate of probable losses contained in the loan portfolio at the evaluation date. Although the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific and general allocations, the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses.

An analysis of changes in the allowance for loan losses and selected ratios for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015 follows:   

Our loan loss reserve, as a percentage of total loans at September 30, 2016, decreased to 1.53% from 1.95% at December 31, 2015 and from 2.27% at September 30, 2015. The change in our loan loss reserve as a percentage of total loans between periods is attributable to the fluctuation in historical loss experience, qualitative factors, fewer loans migrating downward in risk grade classifications, improved charge-off levels, and negative provision expense. Our allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 93.96% at September 30, 2016, compared with 85.48% at December 31, 2015, and 83.58% at September 30, 2015. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2016 totaled $652,000 compared to $3.0 million in the first nine months of 2015.

The following table sets forth the net charge-offs (recoveries) for the periods indicated:   

The majority of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collateral, and the underlying collateral coverage for nonperforming loans supports the likelihood of collection of our principal. We have assessed these loans for collectability and considered, among other things, the borrower s ability to repay, the value of the underlying collateral, and other market conditions to ensure the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses. Our allowance for non-performing loans to non-performing loans was 2.88% at September 30, 2016 compared with 2.09% at December 31, 2015, and 2.31% at September 30, 2015.   
     
  The following table presents the unpaid principal balance, recorded investment and allocated allowance related to loans individually evaluated for impairment in the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

Based on prior charge-offs, our current recorded investment in the commercial real estate and residential real estate segments is significantly below the unpaid principal balance for these loans. The recorded investment net of the allocated allowance was 55.66% and 82.43% of the unpaid principal balance in the commercial real estate and residential real estate segments of the portfolio, respectively, at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The following table illustrates recent trends in loans collectively evaluated for impairment and the related allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment:

Table Of Contents 

Our allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment declined to 1.51% at September 30, 2016 from 2.33% at September 30, 2015 and 1.98% at December 31, 2015. This decline was driven primarily by declining historical loss trends and an improving loan risk category classification mix and volume which are key factors for estimating general reserves. Other factors include the consideration of growth, composition and diversification of our loan portfolio, current delinquency levels, the results of recent regulatory communications and general economic conditions.   
       
    Provision for Loan Losses       A negative provision for loan losses of $1.9 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to negative provision of $2.2 million for the first nine months of 2015. The negative provision for 2016 was driven by declining historical loss rates, improvements in asset quality, and management s assessment of risk within the portfolio. Except for the pass category, all loan risk categories have decreased since December 31, 2015. The pass category increased approximately $33.6 million, the watch category decreased approximately $17.3 million, the special mention category declined approximately $792,000, and the substandard category declined approximately $12.5 million. Net charge-offs were $652,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $3.0 million for September 30, 2015. We consider the size and volume of our portfolio as well as the credit quality of our loan portfolio based upon risk category classification when determining the loan loss provision for each period and the allowance for loan losses at period end.  
   
    Foreclosed Properties     Foreclosed properties at September 30, 2016 were $7.1 million compared with $29.2 million at September 30, 2015 and $19.2 million at December 31, 2015.  See  Note 5 - Other Real Estate Owned,  of the notes to the financial statements. During the first nine months of 2016, we acquired $1.2 million of OREO properties, and sold properties totaling approximately $12.6 million. We value foreclosed properties at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired and expect to liquidate these properties to recover our investment in the due course of business.  
     
  OREO is recorded at fair market value less estimated cost to sell at time of acquisition. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent reductions in fair value are recorded as non-interest expense. To determine the fair value of OREO for smaller dollar single family homes, we consult with internal real estate sales staff and external realtors, investors, and appraisers. If the internally evaluated market price is below our underlying investment in the property, appropriate write-downs are recorded.   
     
  For larger dollar commercial real estate properties, we obtain a new appraisal of the subject property or have staff in our special assets group or centralized appraisal department evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to OREO. In some of these circumstances, an appraisal is in process at quarter end and we must make our best estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral based on our internal evaluation of the property, our review of the most recent appraisal, and discussions with the currently engaged appraiser. We typically obtain updated appraisals on the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent.  
     
  Net gain (loss) on sales, write-downs, and operating expenses for OREO totaled $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $8.8 million for the same period of 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, fair value write-downs of $970,000 were recorded to reflect declines in fair value driven by reductions in listing prices and new appraisals compared with $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
         
    Liabilities       Total liabilities at September 30, 2016 were $871.7 million compared with $916.7 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $45.0 million, or 4.9%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in deposits of $41.1 million from $878.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $836.9 million at September 30, 2016.  
     
  Deposits are our primary source of funds. The following table sets forth the average daily balances and weighted average rates paid for our deposits for the periods indicated:

Liquidity   
     
  Liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs, taking into account all on- and off-balance sheet funding demands. Liquidity risk management also involves ensuring that we meet our cash flow needs at a reasonable cost. We maintain an investment and funds management policy, which identifies the primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance. Our Asset Liability Committee regularly monitors and reviews our liquidity position.   
     
  Funds are available from a number of sources, including the sale of securities in the available for sale investment portfolio, principal pay-downs on loans and mortgage-backed securities, customer deposit inflows, and other wholesale funding. Historically, we also utilized brokered and wholesale deposits to supplement our funding strategy. We are currently restricted from accepting, renewing, or rolling-over brokered deposits without the prior receipt of a waiver on a case-by-case basis from our regulators. At September 30, 2016, we had no brokered deposits.  
     
  Traditionally, we have borrowed from the FHLB to supplement our funding requirements. At September 30, 2016, we had an unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $27.7 million. Our borrowing capacity is under a detailed loan listing requirement and is based on the market value of the underlying pledged loans. Any new advances are limited to a one-year maturity or less.   
     
  We also have available, on a secured basis, federal funds borrowing lines from a correspondent bank totaling $5.0 million. Management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, the availability of these lines could be affected by our financial position. We are also subject to FDIC interest rate restrictions for deposits. As such, we are permitted to offer up to the  national rate  plus 75 basis points as published weekly by the FDIC.  
       
   Capital   
     
  Stockholders  equity increased $11.6 million to $43.6 million at September 30, 2016, compared with $32.0 million at December 31, 2015 due to the issuance of $5.0 in common stock, current year net income of $3.9 million and an increase in the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio of $2.3 million.

The following table shows the ratios of Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-adjusted assets and the leverage ratios for the Company and the Bank at the dates indicated:   

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.      
     
  Each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III regulatory capital reforms became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015, and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. These rules refine the definition of what constitutes  capital  for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. The Company and the Bank opted out of this requirement. The rules also establish a  capital conservation buffer  of 2.5%, to be phased in over three years, above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. Once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the minimum ratios are a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement begins in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. In addition, our Consent Order calls for the Bank to maintain a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets ( total risk-based capital ratio ) of at least 12.0%, and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets ( leverage ratio ) of 9.0%. The Bank cannot be considered  well-capitalized  while subject to the consent order.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk       
     
  Given a 100 basis point increase in interest rates sustained for one year, base net interest income would decrease by an estimated 0.7% at September 30, 2016, compared with an increase of 0.6% at December 31, 2015, and is within the risk tolerance parameters of our risk management policy. Given a 200 basis point increase in interest rates sustained for one year, base net interest income would decrease by an estimated 1.6% at September 30, 2016, compared with an increase of 1.6% at December 31, 2015, and is within the risk tolerance parameters of our risk management policy.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures    
     
  As of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were, to the best of their knowledge, effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms as of such date.   
     
  There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
