CORE LABORATORIES N.V. 
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1  .    BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Core Laboratories N.V. and its subsidiaries for which we have a controlling voting interest and/or a controlling financial interest. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information using the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required by U.S. GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "  2015   Annual Report"). 
    
  Core Laboratories N.V. uses the equity method of accounting for investments in which it has less than a majority interest and over which it does not exercise control but does exert significant influence. We use the cost method to record certain other investments in which we own less than 20% of the outstanding equity and do not exercise control or exert significant influence. Non-controlling interests have been recorded to reflect outside ownership attributable to consolidated subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented have been included in these financial statements. Furthermore, the operating results presented for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Core Laboratories N.V.'s balance sheet information for the year ended   December 31, 2015   was derived from the   2015   audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
    
  References to "Core Lab", the "Company", "we", "our" and similar phrases are used throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

2  .    INVENTORIES    
    
  Inventories consist of the following (in thousands): 

We include freight costs incurred for shipping inventory to customers in the Cost of product sales line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

3  .    ACQUISITIONS    
    
  In the second quarter of 2015, we acquired a business providing additional reservoir fluids technology for   $17.2 million   in cash. We accounted for this acquisition by allocating the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in an increase to goodwill of   $13.7 million   and an increase of   $2.0 million   in intangible assets. The acquisition of this entity did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statements of Operations, and was recorded in the Reservoir Description business segment.

                                                                         Return to Index  

4  .    LONG-TERM DEBT    
    
  We have no capital lease obligations. Long-term debt is summarized in the following table (in thousands): 

We have two series of senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of   $150 million   ("Senior Notes") issued in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of   $75 million   in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of   4.01%   and are due in full on   September 30, 2021  . Series B consists of   $75 million   in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of   4.11%   and are due in full on   September 30, 2023  . Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. 
       
  We maintain a revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") that allows for an aggregate borrowing capacity of   $400 million  . The Credit Facility also provides an option to increase the commitment under the Credit Facility by an additional   $50 million   to bring the total borrowings available to   $450 million   if certain prescribed conditions are met by the Company. The Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus   1.25%   to a maximum of LIBOR plus   2.00%  .  
    
  Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due   August 29, 2019  , when the Credit Facility matures. Our available capacity at any point in time is reduced by borrowings outstanding at the time and outstanding letters of credit which totaled   $25.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of   $316.3 million  . In addition to those items under the Credit Facility, we had   $9.4 million   of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The terms of the Credit Facility and Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. We believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreements. Certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and Senior Notes. 
    
  In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of   $50 million  . See Note   12   -   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  . 
    
  The estimated fair value of total debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   approximated the book value of total debt. The fair value was estimated using Level 2 inputs by calculating the sum of the discounted future interest and principal payments through the date of maturity.  

5  .    PENSION    
    
  Defined Benefit Plan 
    
  We provide a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our Dutch employees ("Dutch Plan") who were hired prior to 2007. The pension benefit is based on years of service and final pay or career average pay, depending on when the employee began participating. The benefits earned by the employees are immediately vested.  
    
  The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost under the Dutch Plan for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 
  
    7 
                                                                         Return to Index  

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $1.1 million   to fund the estimated   2016   premiums on investment contracts held by the Dutch Plan. 

6  .   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
    
  We have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include, but are not limited to, employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with the provision of our services and products. Management does not currently believe that any of our pending contractual, employment-related, personal injury or property damage claims and disputes will have a material effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 

7  .    EQUITY    
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   24,795   of our common shares for   $2.8 million  . Included in this total were rights to   8,795   shares valued at   $1.0 million   that were surrendered to us pursuant to the terms of a stock-based compensation plan in consideration of the participants' tax burdens that may result from the issuance of common shares under that plan. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   34,959   of our common shares for   $3.9 million  . Included in this total were rights to   18,959   shares valued at   $2.2 million   that were surrendered to us pursuant to the terms of a stock-based compensation plan in consideration of the participants' tax burdens that may result from the issuance of common shares under that plan. Such common shares, unless canceled, may be reissued for a variety of purposes such as future acquisitions, non-employee director stock awards or employee stock awards. We distributed   29,028   and   62,920   treasury shares upon vesting of stock-based awards during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  In   February, May and August 2016  , we paid quarterly dividends of   $0.55   per share of common stock. In addition, on   October 11, 2016  , we declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.55   per share of common stock for shareholders of record on   October 21, 2016   and payable on   November 22, 2016  . 
    
  On   May 17, 2016   we completed a public offering of   1,475,000   shares of our common stock. The purchase price paid by the underwriter was   $116.67   per share. On   May 26, 2016  , the underwriter exercised in full its option to purchase an additional   221,250   shares of common stock at the public offering price of   $116.67   per share bringing the total shares issued from the offering to 1,696,250. The net proceeds from these issuances of common stock were   $197.2 million  , after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility.  
    
  At the annual meeting of shareholders on   May 19, 2016  , our shareholders approved the cancellation of   1,250,000   shares of our common stock then held as treasury stock. This treasury stock   was   cancelled on   August 2, 2016  , after the expiration of the waiting period required under Dutch law. In accordance with ASC 505-30-30-8, we   charged   the excess of the cost of the treasury stock over its par value to additional paid-in capital.

The following table summarizes our changes in equity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands, except share data): 

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following (in thousands, net of tax):

                                                                         Return to Index  

8  .    EARNINGS PER SHARE    
    
  We compute basic earnings per common share by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common and potential common shares include additional shares in the weighted average share calculations associated with the incremental effect of dilutive restricted stock awards and contingently issuable shares, as determined using the treasury stock method. The following table summarizes the calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share (in thousands): 

9  .   OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET    
    
  The components of other (income) expense, net, were as follows (in thousands): 

Foreign exchange (gain) loss, net by currency is summarized in the following table (in thousands): 

10 
                                                                         Return to Index  

10  .    INCOME TAX EXPENSE    
    
  The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   11.0%   compared to   22.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   12.8%   compared to   22.7%   for the same period in 2015. Income tax expense of   $2.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased   by   $7.7 million   compared to   $9.8 million   in the same period in   2015  , primarily in the United States as taxable income recognized in the United States decreased by   $18.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   2015  . No other jurisdiction in which we operate had a material change in income tax expense. 

11  .    SEVERANCE AND OTHER CHARGES    
    
  In 2015 and throughout 2016, in response to reduced spending by our clients on their oil and gas fields as a result of lower commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, we reduced our cost structure, primarily through a reduction in our workforce, to better align with the decreasing activity levels into the foreseeable future. As a result of these cost reductions, we recorded severance charges of   $8.8 million   in 2015, of which   $7.1 million   was recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.6 million   was accrued and remaining to be paid. 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we continued to closely monitor rig counts, crude oil and natural gas prices, and activity levels within the industry. We continued to execute our cost reduction initiative which began in the first quarter of 2015, but no additional expenses associated with severance or asset impairments were recorded during the three or nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

12  .    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    
    
  We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus   1.25%   to a maximum of LIBOR plus   2.00%  . As a result of two interest rate swap agreements, we are subject to interest rate risk on debt in excess of $50 million drawn on our Credit Facility. 
    
  In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of   $50 million   to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on   $50 million   of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of   $25 million  , we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at   1.73%   through   August 29, 2019  , and under the second swap agreement of   $25 million  , we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at   2.5%   through   August 29, 2024  . Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) and are recognized in income as an increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had fixed rate long-term debt aggregating   $200 million   and variable rate long-term debt aggregating   $8 million  , after taking into account the effect of the swaps. 
    
  The fair values of outstanding derivative instruments are as follows (in thousands): 

The fair value of all outstanding derivatives was determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market (Level 2) or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data. 

11 
                                                                         Return to Index  

The effect of the interest rate swaps on the Consolidated Statement of Operations was as follows (in thousands): 

13  .    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
    
  The Company's only financial assets and liabilities which involve fair value measures relate to certain aspects of the Company's benefit plans and our derivative instruments. We use the market approach to value certain assets and liabilities at fair value using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) with the assistance of a third party specialist. We do not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices in an active market (Level 1) or significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Gains and losses related to the fair value changes in the deferred compensation assets and liabilities are recorded in General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses related to the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss). The following table summarizes the fair value balances (in thousands):

15  .    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    
    
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-02 ("Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis") which amends the guidelines for determining whether certain legal entities should be consolidated. This update eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships are variable interest entities or voting interest entities. Overall, the amendments in this Update are an improvement to current GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard had no effect on our current consolidated financial statements or on the entities that we consolidate. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 ("Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes") to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This pronouncement is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2016 and applied the adoption prospectively. The adoption of this standard had no effect on our current Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows but had an immaterial effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheet with the reclassification of certain deferred tax balance sheet accounts. The comparative prior period Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 was not retrospectively adjusted. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 ("Revenue from Contracts with Customers"), which provides guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance requires entities to apply a five-step method to (1) identify the contract(s) with customers; (2) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (on July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the implementation date for one year). Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several amendments which clarify certain points in the new Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including ASU 2016-08 ("Principal versus Agent Considerations - Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net"), ASU 2016-10 ("Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing"), ASU 2016-11 ("Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting"), and ASU 2016-12 ("Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients"). We anticipate adopting all of these standards at the same time. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 ("Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory") to require the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This pronouncement is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this standard will have no material effect on our current consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ("Leases"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 ("Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting") which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 ("Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments") which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Outlook 
    
  As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue our long-term efforts to expand our market presence by opening or expanding facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines subject to client demand and market conditions. We believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service clients who have global operations whether they are international oil companies, national oil companies, or independent oil companies. 
    
  During 2015, average crude oil prices decreased 48% compared to 2014, which resulted in a significant decrease in activities and spending related to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Although crude oil prices showed some strengthening during 2016, with West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") increasing from $37.13 per barrel at December 31, 2015 to $47.72 per barrel at September 30, 2016, the average price during the first nine months of 2015 and 2016 was $50.94 and $41.35, respectively, a 19% decrease. 
    
  In North America, land-based activity continues to be the most significantly impacted by these lower commodity prices, as the average land-based rig count for the third quarter of 2016 decreased 45% from the same period of 2015. However, the average land-based rig count in North America increased 16% sequentially, responding to some stability and improvement in the commodity prices during the quarter. During the quarter, however, the number of completions declined according to information provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration ("EIA"). 
    
  Outside of North America, activities associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas have also decreased from 2015 levels, although not as significantly as the land-based activities in North America. The average international rig count for the third quarter of 2016 is   down     17%   from the same period in 2015. These reduced international activities have impacted most regions, except the Middle East, where we continued to see sustained levels for the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  We believe the anticipated "V-shaped" worldwide commodity recovery has begun. One indication is that several U.S.-based operators continue to announce rig additions. Further, global demand for hydrocarbon-based energy continues to increase, while worldwide crude oil supply peaked in the second half of 2015 and began a decline that we believe will continue through all of 2016 and 2017. We have observed that U.S. oil production peaked at approximately 9,700,000 barrels of oil per day ("BOPD") in March 2015 and has fallen since then by an estimated 1,300,000 BOPD, with decreases of 450,000 BOPD in 2015 and another 850,000 BOPD so far in 2016.  
    
  At current activity levels, we predict 2016 U.S. onshore oil production will fall more than 1,100,000 BOPD which may be somewhat offset by deepwater Gulf of Mexico ("GOM") gains of approximately 100,000 BOPD (significantly lower than previously projected), yielding a U.S. net decline of 1,000,000 BOPD and an updated net decline curve rate of approximately 11%. Based on currently available worldwide crude oil production data, coupled with internal Core Lab data, we estimate that the net worldwide annual crude oil production decline rate is approximately 3.3%. That is supported by recent International Energy Agency ("IEA") reports that worldwide crude oil production continued to fall through the third quarter of 2016 and by recent bullish U.S. inventory trends. In addition to the U.S. decline, we expect 2016 production declines in Angola, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Iraq, Mexico, Nigeria, and Venezuela, among others. China recently reported a year-over-year production decline of 10% to less than 3,900,000 BOPD, nearing a six-year low. 
    
  The net worldwide decline rate is predicated on sharper decline curve rates for tight-oil reservoirs and a significant reduction of maintenance capital expenditures for the existing crude oil production base. These factors, together with the continuing decline in global production, recent Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") action, the accelerated decline in U.S.-based inventories, and the continuing increase in global energy consumption are creating a tighter crude oil supply market and are expected to result in increasing crude prices and industry activity levels worldwide. This expectation does not take into account any unanticipated demand or supply fluctuations caused by industry or geopolitical events. 
    
  Response to Decline in Oilfield Services Activities 
    
  In 2015 and throughout 2016, in response to reduced spending by our clients on their oil and gas fields as a result of lower commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, we reduced our cost structure, primarily through a reduction in our workforce, to better align with the decreasing activity levels into the foreseeable future. As a result of these cost reductions, we recorded severance charges of   $8.8 million   in 2015, of which   $7.1 million   was recorded in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.6 million   was accrued and remaining to be paid. 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we continued to closely monitor rig counts, crude oil and natural gas prices, and activity levels within the industry. We continued to execute our cost reduction initiative which began in the first quarter of 2015, but no additional accruals or write-offs were recorded during the three or nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Operating Results for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   June 30, 2016     and     September 30, 2015   and for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Services Revenue 
    
  Services revenue   decreased     3%   to   $114.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $118.2 million   for the   second   quarter of   2016   and   decreased     24%   as compared to   $150.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The sequential decrease in service revenue is primarily due to reduced activity in South America and Asia-Pacific regions.  The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to the decrease in industry activity; however, the global average rig count for the third quarter of 2016   decreased     30%   when compared to the same period of 2015. Our services revenue outperformed the decrease in the global rig count as demand for our analytical, diagnostic, and completion services are less impacted by decreases in drilling activities. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , services revenue decreased   24%   to   $355.1 million   as compared to   $470.0 million   for the same period of   2015  . The average global rig count for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     fell   by   36%   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by decreases in North America. Our continued focus on worldwide crude oil related and large natural gas liquefaction projects, especially those related to the development of deepwater fields off West and East Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, kept services revenue from declining further.

Product Sales Revenue 
    
  Revenue associated with product sales decreased   2%   to   $29.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $29.9 million   for the   second   quarter of   2016   and decreased   38%   as compared to   $47.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our product sales revenue is primarily driven by sales in the North American market and, more specifically, the activity associated with the completion of wells. During the third quarter of 2016, the number of active rigs did show a slight increase; however, this has not translated into an increase of wells being completed which are down sequentially according to the EIA. As a result of our differentiated well completion products, we continued to outperform in the market place, and as a result our product sales did not decrease as much as the average North America rig count, which   declined     43%   year-over-year. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , product sales revenue decreased   38%   to   $90.1 million   compared to   $144.8 million   during the same period in   2015   where the average rig count in North America   decreased   by   52%  . 
    
  Cost of Services 
    
  Cost of services expressed as a percentage of services revenue was flat at   71%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   and increased compared to   63%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Cost of services expressed as a percentage of services revenue increased to   70%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   63%   for the same period in   2015  . These increases were primarily due to our fixed-cost structure not being absorbed on lower revenue in   2016   when compared to   2015  . 
    
  Cost of Product Sales 
    
  Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue was   91%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   89%   and   74%   for the three months ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue increased to   90%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   78%   for the same period in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to our fixed-cost structure not being absorbed on lower revenue in   2016   when compared to   2015  . 
    
  General and Administrative Expense 
    
  General and administrative ("G A") expense includes corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. G A expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.4 million   compared to   $11.1 million   and   $12.2 million   for the three months ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. G A expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $30.6 million   compared to   $37.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decreases are primarily due to reduced staffing and lower compensation expense. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.7 million   compared to   $6.8 million   and   $6.9 million   for the three months ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $20.3 million   compared to   $20.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Severance and Other Charges 
    
  In 2015 and throughout 2016, in response to reduced spending by our clients on their oil and gas fields as a result of lower commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, we reduced our cost structure, primarily through a reduction in our workforce, to better align with the decreasing activity levels into the foreseeable future. As a result of these cost reductions, we recorded severance charges of   $8.8 million   in 2015, of which   $7.1 million   was recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.6 million   was accrued and remaining to be paid. 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we continued to closely monitor rig counts, crude oil and natural gas prices, and activity levels within the industry. We continued to execute our cost reduction initiative which began in the first quarter of 2015, but no additional expenses associated with severance or asset impairments were recorded during the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.6 million   compared to   $3.0 million   and   $3.5 million   for the three months ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the reduction of our outstanding debt during the second quarter of 2016. Interest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was   $9.0 million  . 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   11.0%   compared to   3.9%   and   22.5%   for both the three months ended   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   12.8%   compared to   22.7%   for the same period in 2015. Income tax expense of   $2.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased   by   $7.7 million   compared to   $9.8 million   in the same period in   2015  , primarily in the United States as taxable income recognized in the United States decreased by   $18.2 million   in   2016   compared to   2015  . No other jurisdiction in which we operate had a material change in income tax expense.

Reservoir Description 
    
  Revenue from the Reservoir Description segment was   $100.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   3%   from   $103.0 million   in the   second   quarter of   2016   and   a decrease   of   15%   from   $117.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue   decreased     $53.8 million   to   $304.8 million  , compared to the same period in   2015  . This segment s operations continue to work on large-scale, long-term crude-oil and liquefied natural gas projects with an emphasis on deepwater developments and international markets. We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Asia-Pacific areas, offshore West and East Africa, the U.S. Permian basin, offshore Guyana, and the Middle East, including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

Operating income was   $20.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   6%   compared to   $19.2 million   in the   second   quarter of   2016   and   a decrease   of   33%   compared to   $30.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The improvement sequentially is the result of Core's cost reduction programs which continue to right-size expense levels. The decrease year-over-year was primarily due to our fixed-cost structure not being fully absorbed on lower revenue in 2016 when compared to 2015. Operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   to   $57.8 million   compared to   $89.8 million   for the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower revenue. Operating margins improved to   20%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   19%   in the   second   quarter of   2016  , but were down from   26%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . This segment emphasizes technologically demanding services on internationally-based development and production-related crude oil projects over more cyclical exploration-related projects. 
    
  Production Enhancement 
    
  Revenue from the Production Enhancement segment, largely focused on North American unconventional reservoirs and complex deepwater completions and stimulations, was   $37.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   4%   from   $39.1 million   in the   second   quarter of   2016  . The decreased revenue was more tied to a decreased number of U.S. completions in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to completions in the second quarter of the year.  Revenue from this segment decreased   42%   from   $64.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   as the average rig count for North America   decreased     43%  . Revenue   decreased     43%   to   $120.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $210.7 million   for the same period in   2015   as the average rig count for North America for the first   nine   months of   2016     decreased     52%   from the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Operating income in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $1.1 million  ,   an increase   from   $0.8 million   in the   second   quarter of   2016   and   a decrease   from   $11.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increased profitability was related to our cost reduction program and increasing numbers of technologically sophisticated and challenging projects, many located throughout the Permian Basin. The decrease in year-over-year operating income was primarily due to lower revenue in   2016   caused by the reduction in activities and spending of our clients in 2016, primarily in North America. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating income   decreased   to   $6.0 million   from   $35.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was due to lower revenue in   2016   as compared to 2015. Operating margins were   3%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up from   2%   in the   second   quarter of 2016, which showed modest improvement despite the decrease in revenue. Operating margins for the third quarter of 2016 were down from   18%   for the   third   quarter of   2015   as a result of absorbing less of our fixed costs on lower revenue. 
    
  Reservoir Management 
    
  Revenue from the Reservoir Management segment was   $5.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $0.3 million   from the   second   quarter of   2016   and   a decrease   of   $8.7 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . Revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   to   $19.6 million   compared to   $45.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in   2016   when compared to   2015   is primarily due to the decrease of oil commodity prices which, as a result, greatly reduced or eliminated discretionary spending from our oil and gas clients. The spending cut backs in the Canadian oil sands have negatively impacted sales of Reservoir Management's instrumentation. We continue to have interest in our existing multi-client reservoir studies such as the   Avalon Basin   study and the   Tight Oil Reservoirs of the Midland Basin   study, both within the larger area of the Permian Basin acreage, as five companies were added to these two studies during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Operating income in the   third   quarter of   2016   was a   $0.1 million   loss,   a decrease   from a gain of   $0.4 million   during the   second   quarter of   2016   and   a decrease   from a gain of   $4.8 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating income   decreased   to   $0.8 million   compared to   $12.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . These decreases were due primarily to lower revenue. Operating margins were   (2.2%)   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down from   7%   and   33%   in the   second   quarter of   2016   and   third   quarter of   2015  , respectively. Operating margins for Reservoir Management can fluctuate due to the sale of fully completed studies, which generate significant incremental margins.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General 
    
  We have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our dividend and share repurchase programs. If necessary, we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures, business acquisitions, or the repurchase of the Company's common shares. As we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $15.5 million   of our   $17.2 million   of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
    
  We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

The   decrease   in free cash flow for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to lower net income and less significant improvements in working capital, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table summarizes cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Cash flows from operating activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015     decreased   primarily due to lower net income and less significant improvements to working capital. 
    
  The   decrease   in cash flows used in investing activities during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily attributable to an acquisition in 2015 as well as lower capital expenditures in 2016.

                                                                         Return to Index  

Cash flows used in financing activities   decreased   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we issued   1,696,250   shares of our common stock for net proceeds of   $197.2 million  , after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we   decreased   our debt by   $227.2 million  , as compared to increasing it by   $70.3 million   during the first   nine   months of   2015  . In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased   34,959   shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $3.9 million   compared to the repurchase of   1,311,616   shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $144.5 million   during the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Notes, Credit Facilities and Available Future Liquidity 
    
  We have two series of senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of   $150 million   ("Senior Notes") issued in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of   $75 million   in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of   4.01%   and are due in full on   September 30, 2021  . Series B consists of   $75 million   in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of   4.11%   and are due in full on   September 30, 2023  . Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. 
    
  We maintain a revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") that allows for an aggregate borrowing capacity of   $400 million  . The Credit Facility also provides an option to increase the commitment under the Credit Facility by an additional   $50 million   to bring the total borrowings available to   $450 million   if certain prescribed conditions are met by the Company. The Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus   1.25%   to a maximum of LIBOR plus   2.00%  .  
    
  Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due   August 29, 2019  , when the Credit Facility matures. Our available capacity at any point in time is reduced by borrowings outstanding at the time and outstanding letters of credit which totaled   $25.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of   $316.3 million  . In addition to those items under the Credit Facility, we had   $9.4 million   of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The terms of the Credit Facility and Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. We believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreements. Certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and Senior Notes. 
    
  In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of   $50 million  . See Note   12   -   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  . 
    
  Our ability to maintain and grow our operating income and cash flow depends, to a large extent, on continued investing activities. We believe our future cash flows from operations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity and issuances of additional equity, should be sufficient to fund our debt requirements, capital expenditures, working capital, dividend payments and future acquisitions. 
    
  Other Matters 
    
  Several months ago, there were news reports related to Unaoil, a Monaco based company, and activities Unaoil may have engaged in related to international projects involving several global companies, including Core Lab. It has also been reported that the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") is conducting an investigation of Unaoil related to the information reported in these news articles. The DOJ contacted the Company in connection with that investigation, and the Company will cooperate with the DOJ.

  There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our   2015   Annual Report. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  A complete discussion of our controls and procedures is included in our   2015   Annual Report. 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
