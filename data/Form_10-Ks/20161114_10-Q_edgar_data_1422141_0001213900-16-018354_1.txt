Nature
of Operations   

Zeta
Acquisition Corp. I (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007. The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company's principal business objective for the next twelve
(12) months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business. The Company will not
restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire
any type of business.  

Going
Concern   

Since
its inception, the Company has generated no revenues and has incurred a net loss of $260,014. Since inception, the Company has
been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its continuing activities. The Company has not
identified any business combination and therefore, cannot ascertain with any degree of certainty the capital requirements for
any particular transaction. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
capital resources but it is uncertain whether this funding will continue. The accompanying financial statements have been presented
on the basis of the continuation of the Company as a going concern and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three (3) months
or less to be cash equivalents.

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns.  A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset
to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 825-10,  Financial Instruments , the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments
included on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The Company considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses, and notes payable to stockholders to approximate fair value due to their
short maturity.  

Net
Loss Per Share   

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The
Company currently has no dilutive securities and as such, basic and diluted loss per share are the same for all periods presented.  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
unaudited interim financial information included in this report reflects normal recurring adjustments that management believes
are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the periods presented.
This interim information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes contained in the Company s
Form 10-K filed March 30, 2016.  

The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for other interim periods or the full year.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

On
January 1, 2015, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ), Accounting Standards Update,
( ASU ), No. 2014-10, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity, ( DSE ), in its entirety
from United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, ( U.S. GAAP ). In accordance with ASU No. 2014-10, the
Company has removed labeling the financial statements as a DSE and has eliminated inception-to-date information in the financial
statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The objective of the guidance is to require management
to explicitly assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain
circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management will assess if there is substantial doubt about an
entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of an entity's financial statements. The
new standard defines substantial doubt and provides examples of indicators thereof. The definition of substantial doubt incorporates
a likelihood threshold of  probable  similar to the current use of that term in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies. The
new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier application
is permitted. The Company is currently assessing this standard for its impact on future reporting periods.  

2.      Notes
                                         Payable, Stockholders     

During
2016, various stockholders loaned the Company $22,500 and were issued unsecured promissory notes which bear interest of 6% and
are due on demand. During 2015 stockholders loaned the company $35,000, along with note reductions of $10,000. Similar stockholder
loans amounted to $15,000 during 2014, $25,000 during 2013, $25,000 during 2012, $35,000 during 2010, and $25,000 during 2009.
Interest of $39,536 was accrued and unpaid at September 30, 2016.

The

Forward
Looking Statement Notice    

Certain
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Quarterly Report ) are  forward-looking statements 
(within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management
for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual
results, performance or achievements of Zeta Acquisition Corp. I ( we,   us,   our  or the
 Company ) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve
numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued
expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic,
competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately
and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking
statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in
the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by
the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.  

Description
of Business    

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007, and maintains its principal executive office at 666 Walnut
Street, Suite 2116, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining
initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger
with, an operating business. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10-SB with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ) on February 1, 2008, and since its effectiveness, the Company has focused its efforts to identify a possible
business combination.  

The
Company, based on proposed business activities, is a  blank check  company. The SEC defines those companies as  any
development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that
its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.  Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations
limiting the sale of securities of  blank check  companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also
a  shell company,  defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than
cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities,
either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.  

In
addition, the Company is an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
(the  JOBS Act ), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements
of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and
any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  

The
Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election,
our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our
revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period,
(3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market
value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently
completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a  smaller reporting company, 
as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain
of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company,
including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley
Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements,
instead of three years.  

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company s principal business objective for the next 12
months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating business. The
Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location
and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  

The
Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate
incurring costs related to:  

(i)  
      filing
    Exchange Act reports, and   

(ii)  
      investigating,
    analyzing and consummating an acquisition.   

We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service
providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
As of the date of the period covered by this report, the Company has $8,885 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company
will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however, our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations
and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern
is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target Company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such Company.
Management s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related
party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  

The
Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional
funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business
which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which
desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  

Since
our registration statement on Form 10-SB went effective, our management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives
of other entities regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable
company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or
earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable
and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an
industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a
particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our
management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s
plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another.  

The
Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic
conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes
that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of
becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other
things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the
principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees,
and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially
available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will
make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets equal to $8,885 comprised of cash and cash equivalents. This compares with
current assets of $7,427 comprised of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015. The Company s current
liabilities as of September 30, 2016 totaled $218,899, comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and notes
payable to stockholders. This compares with current liabilities of $196,910, comprised of accounts payable, accrued interest,
accrued expenses and notes payable to stockholders, as of December 31, 2015. The Company can provide no assurance that it
can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  

The
following is a summary of the Company s cash flows provided by (used in) operating and financing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital
investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a
private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able
to implement its plan of operations.  

Results
of Operations    

The
Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No
revenue has been generated by the Company from November 16, 2007 (Inception) through September 30, 2016. It is unlikely the Company
will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no
assurance. It is management s assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. The Company s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable
acquisition candidates.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $6,642, consisting of interest expense and legal, accounting,
audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s periodic
reports. This compares with a net loss of $6,821 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, consisting of interest expense
and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s
periodic reports.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $20,531, consisting of interest expense and legal, accounting,
audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s periodic
reports. This compares with a net loss of $19,908 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisting of interest expense
and legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s
periodic reports.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Obligations

Growth Company    

As
an  emerging growth company  under the JOBS Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those
standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
that comply with public company effective dates.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
