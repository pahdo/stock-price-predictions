(1)    Basis of Presentation    

  The accompanying
unaudited financial statements of Provident Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the  Company ), were prepared
in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and with Regulation S-X and do not include information or footnotes necessary
for a complete presentation of the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles ( GAAP ). However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the
three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future
periods, including the entire fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements
and notes thereto included in the annual report on Form 10-K the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March
30, 2016.   

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Provident Bancorp, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, The Provident Bank (the  Bank ),
and the Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries, Provident Security Corporation and 5 Market Street Security Corporation. Provident
Security Corporation and 5 Market Street Security Corporation were established to buy, sell, and hold investments for their own
account. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   

(2)    Corporate Structure    

  On
March 10, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a plan of stock issuance (the  Plan ) pursuant to which
the Company sold shares of common stock, representing a minority ownership of the estimated pro forma market value of the Company.
 On July 15, 2015, the Company issued 4,274,425 shares of common stock to the public at $10.00 per share, including 357,152
shares purchased by The Provident Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In addition, the Company issued 5,034,323 shares to Provident
Bancorp, the Company s mutual holding company (the  MHC ), and 189,974 shares to The Provident Community Charitable
Organization, Inc., a charitable foundation that was formed in connection with the stock offering and is dedicated to supporting
charitable organizations operating in the Bank s local community. A total of 9,498,722 shares of common stock were outstanding
following the completion of the stock offering. 

Expenses
incurred related to the offering were $1.5 million, and were recorded against offering proceeds.  

Upon
the completion of the stock offering, a special  liquidation account  was established for the benefit of certain depositors
of the Bank in an amount equal to the percentage ownership interest in the equity of the Company to be held by persons other than
the MHC as of the date of the latest balance sheet contained in the prospectus utilized in connection with the offering. The Company
is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if the Company s shareholders  equity would be reduced below
the amount of the liquidation account. The liquidation account will be reduced annually to the extent that eligible account holders
have reduced their qualifying deposits. Subsequent increases will not restore an eligible account holder s interest in the
liquidation account.

(3)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

  ASU (Accounting Standards Update) No.
2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The ASU establishes a single comprehensive model for an
entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled, and will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, to clarify and
converge revenue recognition principles under US GAAP and Internationl Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The update outlines
five steps to recognizing revenue: (i) identify the contracts with the customer; (ii) identify the separate performance obligations
in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations;
(v) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. The update requires more comprehensive disclosures, relating
to quantitative and qualitative information for amounts, timing, the nature and uncertainty of revenue, and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers, which will mainly impact construction and high-tech industries. The most significant potential impact
to banking entities relates to less prescriptive derecognition requirements on the sale of other real estate owned (OREO) property.
In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by
one year. Accordingly, the amendments are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. An entity may elect either a full retrospective
or a modified retrospective application. The Company does not expect the application of this guidance will have a material impact
on the Company's financial statements. 

ASU
No. 2014-14, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40) -  Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed
Residential Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) .  The ASU has been issued
to reduce diversity in practice in the classification of foreclosed residential mortgage loans held by creditors that are fully
guaranteed under certain government programs, including the Federal Housing Administration guarantees. A residential mortgage loan
would be derecognized and a separate other receivable would be recognized upon foreclosure if the loan has both of the following
characteristics: (i) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure entitling the creditor
to the full unpaid principal balance of the loan; and (ii) at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to make a claim
on the guarantee and the ability to recover the full unpaid principal balance of the loan through the guarantee. Notably, upon
foreclosure, the separate other receivable would be measured based on the current amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered
under the guarantee. The amendments were effective for the Company as of January 1, 2016. This amendment did not impact the Company s
financial statements and the Company does not expect the application of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements in the future.  

ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments
  Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The
ASU has been issued to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring 1) equity investments (except
those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities
by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements;
3) the use of the exit price notion when measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; and 4) separate
presentation by the reporting organization in other comprehensive income for the portion of the total change in the fair value
of a liability resulting from the change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit )
when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial
instruments. The standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. The Company holds a portfolio of marketable
equity securities; depending on the size and composition of the portfolio at the adoption date, the impact of the ASU could be
material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.   

Table of Contents  

ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The
amendments in this update require lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations
created by leases. Accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The guidance will be effective for annual periods, and
interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require
a modified retrospective transition where the lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning
of the earliest period presented. The Company does not expect the application of this guidance will have a material impact on the
Company s financial statements. 

ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit
Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The ASU changes the impairment model
for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans
and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking  expected loss  model that will replace
today s  incurred loss  model and can result in the earlier recognition of credit losses. For available-for-sale
debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except that
the losses will be recognized as an allowance. The amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of
its pending adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.

(4)    Investment Securities    

  In May
2016, the Company reclassified its $44.2 million held-to-maturity investment portfolio to available-for-sale. Due to its strong
outlook for loan growth and falling interest rates, the Company decided to proceed with the reclassification to provide liquidity.
The reclassification increased total shareholders  equity by $1.3 million associated with the recording of the net security
gains on the portfolio, net of tax effect, to accumulated other comprehensive income. In accordance with regulatory and accounting
requirements, the Company is prohibited from classifying security purchases as held-to-maturity for a period of two years.   

The following
summarizes the amortized cost of investment securities classified as available-for-sale and their approximate fair values at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The aggregate
fair value and unrealized losses of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months
and for twelve months or more, are as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Government mortgage-backed securities,
state and municipal securities and asset-backed securities   : Because the decline in fair
value of the government mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and state and municipal securities is primarily attributable
to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments
until market price recovery or maturity, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired.   

Marketable equity securities   :
Management continuously monitors equity securities for impairment by reviewing the financial condition of the issuer, company-specific
events, industry developments, and general economic conditions. Management reviews corporate financial reports, credit agency reports
and other publicly available information. Based on these reviews, these securities are not considered to be other-than-temporarily
impaired.  

Trust preferred securities   :
Management monitors its pooled-trust preferred securities for possible other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This
review includes an analysis of collateral reports, cash flows, stress default levels and financial ratios of the underlying issuers.
Management utilizes a third party to compile this data and perform other-than-temporary impairment cash flow testing. Critical
assumptions that go into the other-than-temporary impairment cash flow testing are prepayment speeds, default rates of the underlying
issuers and discount margins. The result of the third-party other-than-temporary impairment cash flow testing indicated no other-than-temporary
impairment as of September 30, 2016.

In 2016,
we approved one troubled debt restructure totaling $58 thousand, with no specific reserve required based on an analysis of the
borrower s repayment ability and/or collateral coverage. This commercial loan was placed on an extended 13-month interest
only period with re-amortization to follow based on a five-year term.  

The following
tables present the Company s loans by risk rating and portfolio segment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Table of Contents  

Credit Quality Information  

  The Company
utilizes a seven grade internal loan risk rating system for commercial real estate, construction and land development, and commercial
loans as follows:  

Loans rated 1-3   :
Loans in these categories are considered  pass  rated loans with low to average risk.  

Loans rated 4   :
Loans in this category are considered  special mention.  These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness
and are being closely monitored by management.  

Loans rated 5   :
Loans in this category are considered  substandard.  Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately
protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility
that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.  

Loans rated 6   :
Loans in this category are considered  doubtful.  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in
those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis
of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.  

Loans rated 7   :
Loans in this category are considered uncollectible loss and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted.  

On an
annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate, construction and
land development, and commercial loans.  

For residential
real estate and consumer loans, the Company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower s ability to pay and
rates such loans as pass. Subsequent risk rating downgrades are based upon the borrower s payment activity. All other residential
and consumer loans are not formally rated.   

(6) Federal Home Loan Bank Advances  

  Borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) are secured by a blanket lien on qualified collateral, consisting primarily of loans with
first mortgages secured by one to four family properties, certain commercial loans and other qualified assets.  

Maturities
of advances from the FHLB ending after September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows:  

Table of Contents  

(7)    Fair Value Measurements    

  The Company
reports certain assets at fair value in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance establishes a fair value
hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. The standard describes six levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:  

Basis
of Fair Value Measurements  

Level 1 - Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;    

Level 2 - Quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability;    

Level 3 - Prices
or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported
by little or no market activity).    

A financial
instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.  

Fair
Values of Financial Instruments Measured on a Recurring Basis    

  The Company s
investments in U.S. Government and federal agency, state and municipal, corporate debt, asset-backed and government mortgage-backed
securities available-for-sale are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For these investments, we obtain
fair value measurements from independent pricing services. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include
dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit
information and the instrument s terms and conditions.  

The Company
classifies its investments in trust preferred securities as Level 3 securities. Level 3 is for positions that are not traded in
active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability,
and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management s best
estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence
such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable
entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalization and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the
equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows.   

The Company
classified its investments in marketable equity securities as Level 1 securities. Such securities are classified as Level 1 securities
because fair values are obtained through quoted market prices for identical securities in active exchange markets.

Fair Values of Financial
Instruments Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis   

The Company s
impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.
Collateral values are estimated using Level 2 inputs based upon appraisals of similar properties obtained from a third party. However,
the Company generally discounts appraisals to arrive at fair value, therefore classifies such loans as Level 3 because the discounts
are a significant input that is not observable.

(8)    Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

  GAAP
requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for
which it is practicable to estimate that value. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from
the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the
Company.  

The carrying
amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments, all of which are held or issued for purposes other than
trading, are as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

(9)    Regulatory Capital    

  The Bank
is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could
have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital
amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other
factors.   

Effective
January 1, 2015 (with a phase-in period of two to four years for certain components), the Bank became subject to capital regulations
adopted by the FDIC, which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The
new regulations require a new Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.
CET1 generally consists of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable adjustments and deductions. Under new prompt
corrective action regulations, in order to be considered  well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain a CET1 capital
ratio of 6.5% and a Tier 1 ratio of 8.0%, a total risk based capital ratio of 10% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition,
the regulations establish a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that started phasing in on January 1,
2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is fully phased in at 2.5% effective January
1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2016, failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Bank and
the Company to pay dividends, repurchases shares or pay discretionary bonuses.  

The new
regulations implemented changes to what constitutes regulatory capital. Certain instruments no longer constitute qualifying capital,
subject to phase-out periods. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total
capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated
percentages of CET1 must be deducted from capital. The Bank has elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of accumulated
other comprehensive income in capital calculations, as permitted by the regulations. This opt-out will reduce the impact of market
volatility on the Bank s regulatory capital ratios.   

The new
regulations also changed the risk weights of certain assets, including an increase in the risk weight of certain high volatility
commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past
due or on non-accrual status to 150% from 100%, a credit conversion factor for the unused portion of commitments with maturities
of less than one year that are not cancellable to 20% from 0%, an increase in the risk weight for mortgage servicing rights and
deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital to 250% from 100%, and an increase in the risk weight for equity exposures
to 600% from 0%.   

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under
the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management
believes have changed the institution s category. The completion of the stock offering has significantly enhanced the Bank s
Regulatory Capital.  

Table of Contents  

The Bank s actual capital
amounts and ratios are presented in the following table.  

(10)    Employee Stock Ownership Plan    

  The Bank
maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) to provide eligible employees the opportunity to own Company stock.
This plan is a tax-qualified retirement plan for the benefit of Bank employees. Contributions are allocated to eligible participants
on the basis of compensation, subject to federal tax limits. The number of shares committed to be released per year through 2029
is 23,810.  

The Company
contributed funds to a subsidiary to enable it to grant a loan to the ESOP for the purchase of 357,152 shares of the Company s
common stock at a price of $10.00 per share. The loan obtained by the ESOP from the Company s subsidiary to purchase Company
common stock is payable annually over 15 years at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate (3.50% at September 30, 2016). Loan
payments are principally funded by cash contributions from the Bank.  

The
fair value of unallocated shares was approximately $4.9 million at September 30, 2016.  

Total
compensation expense recognized in connection with the ESOP for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $257,000.  

Table of Contents  

(11)    Earnings Per Common Share    

  Basic
earnings per share represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculation. There were no potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents as of September 30, 2016. Earnings per share is not applicable for the period ended September
30, 2015.   

Item 2. Management s Discussion of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  

Management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results
of operations. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of results
for all of 2016 or any other period. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part 1, Item 1 of this report.   

Forward-Looking Statements  

This
document may contain certain forward-looking statements, such as statements of the Company s or the Bank s plans, objectives,
expectations, estimates and intentions. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as  expects, 
 subject,  and  believes,   will,   intends,   will be,   would 
or similar expressions. These statements are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the
Company s or the Bank s control) and actual results may differ materially. Readers should not place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements, which reflect management s analysis of factors only as of the date of which they are given.
These factors include general economic conditions, including its trends and levels of interest rates, the ability of our borrowers
to repay their loans, the ability of the Company or the Bank to effectively manage its growth, real estate values in the market
area, loan demand, competition, and results of regulatory examinations, among other factors. The foregoing list of important factors
is not exclusive. Readers should carefully review the factors described in other documents the Company files from time to time
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Current Reports on Form 8-K.   

Except
as required by applicable law and regulation, the Company does not undertake   and specifically disclaims any obligation
  to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.   

Critical Accounting Policies   

  Critical
accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible
to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management
that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes that the most critical accounting policies, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments,
are as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses .  
 The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through
a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the un-collectability
of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.  

The allowance
for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability
of the loans in light of historical experience, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect
the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation
is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.  

A loan
is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled
payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management
in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest
payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.
Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration
the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s
prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.   

Large
groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, we do not separately identify
individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures.  

The general
component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by
the following loan segments: residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial and
consumer. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data
for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: levels/trends in delinquencies;
trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending
policies, procedures and practices; experience/ability/depth of lending management and staff; and national and local economic trends
and conditions. There were no changes in our policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan
losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.   

The qualitative
factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio
segment are as follows:   

Residential real estate   :
We generally do not originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80% and do not grant subprime loans. Loans with loan
to value ratios greater than 80% require the purchase of private mortgage insurance. All loans in this segment are collateralized
by owner-occupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall
health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.

Commercial real estate   :
Loans in this segment are primarily income-producing properties throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The underlying cash
flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates,
which in turn, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management periodically obtains rent rolls and continually
monitors the cash flows of these loans.   

Table of Contents  

Construction and land development   :
Loans in this segment primarily include speculative and pre sold real estate development loans for which payment is derived from
sale of the property and construction to permanent loans for which payment is derived from cash flows of the property. Credit risk
is affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, and market conditions.   

Commercial   :
Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is expected from the
cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality
in this segment.   

Consumer   :
Loans in this segment are generally unsecured and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.   

The allocated
component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial, commercial
real estate and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective
interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance is established when the discounted
cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.  

We periodically
may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring. All troubled debt restructurings are initially
classified as impaired.   

An unallocated
component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated
component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies
for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio.  

Income Taxes   .
The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are established for the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted
tax rates expected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. A tax valuation
allowance is established, as needed, to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.   

The Company
examines its significant income tax positions quarterly to determine whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by tax authorities.  

Balance Sheet Analysis  

Assets   .
Total assets were $768.2 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $24.8 million, or 3.3%, from $743.4 million at December
31, 2015. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in net loans of $34.4 million, which was partially offset by a net decrease
in investments of $10.1 million.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   .
Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.3 million, or 11.4%, to $22.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $20.5 million at December
31, 2015. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from an increase in deposits and excess cash flows from the securities
portfolio.  

Loans   .
At September 30, 2016, net loans were $589.4 million, or 76.7% of total assets, compared to $554.9 million, or 74.6% of total assets,
at December 31, 2015. An increase in commercial real estate loans of $34.4 million, or 12.1%, and an increase in commercial loans
of $25.0 million, or 22.3%, were partially offset by a decrease in construction and land development loans of $13.1 million, or
18.3%, and a decrease in residential real estate loans of $11.0 million, or 11.9%. Our focus in 2014 on commercial lending is represented
in the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans. The decrease in construction and land development loans and part
of the increase in commercial real estate loans were related to loans moving from the construction phase to permanent funding.

Table of Contents  

The following
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.   

Securities   .
Our available-for-sale securities portfolio increased $34.5 million, or 42.6%, to $115.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $81.0
million at December 31, 2015, while our held-to-maturity securities portfolio decreased $44.6 million to $0 at September 30, 2016
from $44.6 million at December 31, 2015. On May 31, 2016, the Company transferred all of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale
to provide additional liquidity to support loan growth. The cost basis transferred was $44.2 million with an unrealized net gain
of $2.2 million. Our securities portfolio in total decreased as we have set aside excess cash flows from securities to fund potential
loan growth instead of re-investing the proceeds in investment securities.  

Deposits   .
Total deposits increased $33.1 million, or 5.7%, to $610.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $577.2 million at December 31, 2015.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in NOW accounts of $26.2 million, an increase in money market accounts of $17.0 million,
and an increase in savings accounts of $9.2 million. The increases were offset by a decrease in time deposits of $27.1 million.
The increase was attributed to our continued strategy of obtaining our customers  entire deposit relationship, while the
decreases relate to the maturity of brokered deposits.   

Borrowings   .
Borrowings at September 30, 2016 consisted entirely of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Borrowings decreased $16.0 million, or
27.8%, to $41.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $57.4 million at December 31, 2015.   

Shareholders  Equity   .
Total shareholders  equity increased $6.9 million, or 6.8%, to $108.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $101.4 million
at December 31, 2015. The increases are primarily due to year-to-date net income of $4.6 million and an increase in other comprehensive
income of $2.1 million, which includes the $1.3 million net of tax unrealized gain from transferring securities from held-to-maturity
to available-for-sale.

The decrease
in non-performing assets at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily due to loans being upgraded to accrual
status having proven the ability to repay the loan for the required period of time.

Allowance for Loan Losses   .
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at levels considered adequate by management to provide for probable loan losses inherent
in the loan portfolio as of the consolidated balance sheet reporting dates. The allowance for loan losses is based on management s
assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio, including portfolio size and composition, amount of and trend regarding
delinquent and non-accrual loans, national and local business conditions and loss experience and an overall evaluation of the quality
of the underlying collateral.

Results of Operations for the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General   .
Net income attributable to common shareholders increased $1.7 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016 from $86,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was related to the $832,000 increase in net interest
and dividend income, and a decrease in noninterest expense of $1.7 million, which is mainly related to the $2.2 million funding
of the Bank s charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2015. These were partially offset by an increase in salaries
and employee benefits of $203,000, and an increase in income tax expense of $1.1 million.  

Interest and Dividend Income   .
Interest and dividend income, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock, increased $978,000, or 15.2%, to $7.4 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily attributable
to an increase in interest and fees on loans, which increased $977,000, or 17.3%, to $6.6 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The increase
in interest income on loans was due to an increase in the average balance of loans of $66.9 million, or 12.8%, to $589.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $522.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Yield on loans
also increased 18 basis points to 4.4% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 due to our continued focus on higher-yielding commercial
lending.  

Interest Expense   .
Interest expense increased $146,000, or 25.7%, to $713,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $567,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily caused by an increase in interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits
increased $129,000, or 31.5%, to $539,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $410,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, due to the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing eight basis points to 0.48% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the average rate was
primarily the result of increases in the average rate paid on NOW accounts.  

Net Interest and Dividend Income   .
Net interest and dividend income increased $832,000, or 14.1%, to $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to both higher balances of earning assets and
expanding margins. Our net interest rate spread increased 19 basis points to 3.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from 3.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our net interest margin increased 19 basis points to 3.72% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average yield we earned on interest-earning
assets increased 25 basis points to 4.12% while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points
to 0.59%.  

Provision for Loan Losses   .
The provision for loan losses was $163,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $174,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The provisions recorded resulted in an allowance for loan losses of $8.4 million, or 1.40% of total loans
at September 30, 2016, compared to $7.9 million, or 1.40% of total loans, at December 31, 2015 and $7.7 million, or 1.46% of total
loans, at September 30, 2015. The provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in the
loan portfolio as we apply historical loss ratios to newly originated loans, which, absent other factors, results in an increase
in the allowance for loan losses as the loan portfolio increases.  

Table of Contents  

Noninterest Income   .
Noninterest income increased $203,000, or 17.5%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily caused by an increase in the gain on sales of securities
of $223,000, or 103.7%, to $438,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $215,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.  

Noninterest Expense   .
Noninterest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 24.1%, to $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The largest decrease was related to the $2.2 million funding of the Bank s
charitable foundation during the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to no such expense recorded during the three months
ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, which increased
$203,000, or 6.7%, to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to our hiring additional employees to support our loan
growth and the opening of a new branch. Professional services expenses increased $82,000, or 37.8%, to $299 ,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $217,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased management training
and legal and accounting fees.  

Income Tax Provision   .
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $940,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting an effective tax
rate of 34.8%, compared to a benefit of $134,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The changes in the income tax provision
were primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rates are below statutory federal and states rates due primarily
to tax-exempt income related to investments in BOLI and municipal securities.

Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General   .
Net income attributable to common shareholders increased $2.4 million, or 105.6%, to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was related to a $2.2 million increase in
net interest and dividend income, and a decrease in noninterest expense of $1.0 million, which is related to the $2.2 million funding
of the Bank s charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2015. These were partially offset by an increase in salaries
and employee benefits of $819,000, and an increase in income tax expense of $1.6 million.  

Interest and Dividend Income   .
Interest and dividend income, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock, increased $2.7 million, or 14.2%, to $21.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily attributable
to an increase in interest and fees on loans, which increased $2.6 million, or 15.8%, to $18.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and an increase in interest and dividends on
securities of $96,000, or 3.9%.  

The increase
in interest income on loans was due to an increase in the average balance of loans of $67.0 million, or 13.2%, to $574.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $507.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Yield on loans increased
10 basis points to 4.38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to our continued focus on higher-yielding commercial
lending.  

The increase
in interest income on investment securities was primarily due to an increase in average balance of $5.6 million, or 4.8%, to $123.2
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $117.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average
balance increased due to investment purchases made in the last quarter of 2015.  

Interest Expense   .
Interest expense increased $427,000, or 25.7%, to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily caused by an increase in interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on
deposits increased $396,000, or 32.3%, to $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, as the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased nine basis points to 0.49% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the average rate
was primarily the result of increases in the average rates paid on the NOW accounts.  

Net Interest and Dividend Income   .
Net interest and dividend income increased $2.2 million, or 13.0%, to $19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
from $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to both higher balances of earning assets
and expanding margins. Our net interest rate spread increased seven basis points to 3.46% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 from 3.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, while our net interest margin increased nine basis points to 3.64%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average yield we earned
on interest-earning assets increased 14 basis points to 4.04% while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased
seven basis points to 0.58%.  

Provision for Loan Losses   .
The provision for loan losses was $484,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $645,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The provisions recorded resulted in an allowance for loan losses of $8.4 million, or 1.40% of total loans,
at September 30, 2016, compared to $7.9 million, or 1.40% of total loans, at December 31, 2015 and $7.7 million, or 1.46% of total
loans, at September 30, 2015. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in
the loan portfolio as we apply historical loss ratios to newly originated loans, which, absent other factors, results in an increase
in the allowance for loan losses as the loan portfolio increases.

Noninterest Income   .
Noninterest income increased $422,000, or 14.8%, to $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily caused by the increase in gains on sales of securities
of $158,000, or 49.8%, to $475,000 at September 30, 2016 compared to $317,000 at September 30, 2015, and an increase in other income
of $200,000, or 55.4%, to $561,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $361,000 at September 30, 2015. The
increase in other income represents an increase in BOLI income. Additional BOLI of $6.2 million was purchased in the fourth quarter
of 2015.  

Noninterest Expense   .
Noninterest expense decreased $1.0 million, or 6.2%, to $15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $16.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the $2.2 million funding of the Bank s
charitable foundation during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to no such expense recorded during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. Other expense also decreased $101,000, or 4.4%, to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, due primarily to the lower trustee expenses. The 2016 decrease in trustee expenses was due to the non-replacement of retiring
members of the board of directors. The decrease in noninterest expense was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee
benefits expense, which increased $819,000, or 9.4%, to $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $8.7 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to our hiring additional
employees to support our loan growth and the opening of a new branch. Professional services expenses increased $214,000, or 32.3%,
to $876,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $662,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased
management training and legal fees.  

Income Tax Provision   .
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting an effective
tax rate of 33.2%, compared to a provision of $717,000, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.2% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The changes in the income tax provision were primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income. The increase in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in our tax-exempt investments and an increase in taxable income. Our effective tax rates
are below statutory federal and states rates due primarily to tax-exempt income related to investments in BOLI and municipal securities.

Average Balance sheet and Related Yields and Rates  

The following
tables set forth the average balance sheets, annualized average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods
indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the amount of tax free interest-earning assets is immaterial.
All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields
set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income
or interest expense.  

(1)  Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-bearing assets and the weighted
average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.   

(2)  Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.   

(3)  Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets   

Table of Contents  

Rate/Volume Analysis  

The following
table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable
to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effect attributable to changes in
volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this
table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based
on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity
is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of
deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and
securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest
rates, economic conditions and competition.  

We regularly
review the need to adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected
deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability
management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities.  

Our most
liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and
investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $22.8 million. Securities
classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $115.5 million at September 30, 2016.  

At September
30, 2016, we had the ability to borrow a total of $194.1 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. On that date, we had
$41.4 million in advances outstanding. At September 30, 2016, we also had an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston s borrower-in-custody program of $127.9 million, none of which was outstanding as of that date.  

We have
no material commitments or demands that are likely to affect our liquidity other than set forth below. In the event loan demand
were to increase faster than expected, or any unforeseen demand or commitment were to occur, we could access our borrowing capacity
with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston or obtain additional funds through brokered certificates of deposit.  

At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had $22.0 million and $15.6 million in loan commitments outstanding, respectively. In addition
to commitments to originate loans, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $195.1 million and $191.6 million in un-advanced
funds to borrowers, respectively. We also had $5.1 million and $5.5 million in outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Certificates
of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2016 totaled $69.2 million, or 11.3% of total deposits. If these deposits do not
remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan
Bank of Boston advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings
than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit at September 30, 2016. We believe, however, based on past experience that
a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by
adjusting the interest rates offered.  

Our primary
investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we originated $141.4 million of loans, all of which were intended to be held in our portfolio. We also purchased $1.4 million in
securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we originated $138.5 million of loans, all of which were intended
to be held in our portfolio, and we purchased $1.4 million in securities.  

Financing activities consist
primarily of activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We experienced net increases in total deposits of
$33.1 million and $21.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Deposit flows are affected
by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors.
We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $16.0 million and
$21.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
