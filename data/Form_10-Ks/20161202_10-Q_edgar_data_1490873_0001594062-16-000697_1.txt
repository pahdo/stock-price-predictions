NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1: NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS 

The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on December 8, 2009 under the name Pristine Solutions, Inc.  Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Eco Science Solutions, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is charged with the research and exploration of eco-friendly technology and properties. On February 14, 2014, the Company changed its name to Eco Science Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: ESSI).  

On November 4, 2013, through the Agreements for the License of Intellectual Property "(the "License Agreements"), the Company acquired an exclusive license to the EcoFlora Spark Plug (the  EcoFlora Plug ), a unique product with technology for which the US Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) issued Patent #8,853,925 on October 7, 2014.  Effective August 28, 2015, the License Agreements were terminated. 

On August 31, 2015, the Company executed an Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 28, 2015 (the "Purchase Agreement") with Kensington Marketing, Inc., a Nevada corporation, to acquire a certain technology application known as  Stay Hydrated.   In exchange for the technology application, the Company issued 1,500,000 restricted shares of the Company's common stock, valued at $150,000.  On January 11, 2016, the Company cancelled the agreement with Kensington Marketing, cancelled 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock issued to Kensington Marketing, and returned the  Stay Hydrated  application the Company acquired in exchange for the 1,500,000 shares.  

On January 1, 2016, the Company entered into a technology licensing and marketing support agreement with Separation Degrees   One, Inc. ( SDOI ) that will result in the development, licensing and management of on-going technology solutions and marketing campaigns for ESSI s initiatives.  Additionally, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with SDOI wherein the Company acquired a proprietary messaging and customer relationship management software platform from SDOI. 

On January 11, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ) authorized the creation of 1,000 shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock.  The holder of the shares of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock has the right to vote those shares of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock regarding any matter or action that is required to be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval.  The vote of each share of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock is equal to and counted as 10 times the votes of all of the shares of the Company s (i) common stock, and (ii) other voting preferred stock issued and outstanding on the date of each and every vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company regarding each and every matter submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval.   The Series A Voting Preferred Stock will not be convertible into Common Stock. 

The Company agreed to issue 500,000 shares of common stock as consideration for the Asset Purchase Agreement with SDOI, and further to settle all invoices received for services rendered as well as advertising fees incurred by way of issuance of common stock at a 30% discount to market as S-8 shares (ref: Note 3) 

The Company will continue to operate, research and explore eco-friendly technology, social media initiatives and applications that generate revenue through advertisements connected to the social media channels as well as downloads of the application and sales of actual goods from the Company s operating sites.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1: NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS (cont d) 

Going Concern  

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues to date and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future.  As at October 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,901,000 and an accumulated deficit of $12,542,076. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. 

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Financial Statements Presented  

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 210 8-03 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Operating results for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 20 2016. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period s financial statements to conform to the current period s presentation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont d) 

Cash and cash equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had cash, but no cash equivalents. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization on property and equipment are determined using the straight-line method over the three to five year estimated useful lives of the assets. 

Technology and licensing rights (Intangible assets)  

Technology and licensing rights are recorded at cost and capitalized, and are reviewed for impairment at a minimum of once per year or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest a need for evaluation. 

Advertising and Marketing Costs     

Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and were $1,296,327 during the nine month ended October 31, 2016 and $Nil in the same period ended October 31, 2015. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. During the year ended January 31, 2016 the Company impaired $3,500 in long-lived assets relative to the acquisition of a communications platform.  In fiscal 2015 there was no impairment of long-lived assets. 

Fair Value Measurements  

Pursuant to ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  and ASC 825,  Financial Instruments , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 and 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 and 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: 

Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: 

Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3: 

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 820 and 825, the fair value of cash is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont d) 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been provided, and collectability is reasonably assured.  As of October 31, 2016, no revenue has been recognized, as the Company changed its core business in January 2016 and is currently developing its new business operation. 

Cost of Revenue  

Costs of revenue consist of the direct expenses incurred in order to generate revenue. Such costs are recorded as incurred. Our cost of revenue will consist consists primarily of fees associated with the operation of our social media venues and fulfillment of specific customer advertising campaigns related to our downloadable apps. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Share-Based Payments , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. 

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share  

The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earning per Share .  ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements  

I n October 2016, the  Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")  No. 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Topic 740): This update simplifies the accounting for the income tax consequences of transfers of assets from one unit of a corporation to another unit or subsidiary by eliminating an accounting exception that prevents the recognition of current and deferred income tax consequences for such  intra-entity transfers  until the assets have been sold to an outside party. The amendment should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early application permitted. The standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements (cont d)  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Under existing accounting guidance, tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies arising from the vesting of share-based payments are recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The new guidance will require such benefits or deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the statement of operations.  Companies are required to apply the new guidance prospectively. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Further, the lease requires a finance lease to recognize both an interest expense and an amortization of the associated expense. Operating leases generally recognize the associated expense on a straight line basis. ASU 2016-02 requires the Company to adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach and adoption beginning on January 1, 2019. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This new standard provides guidance on how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value. This standard requires that entities measure certain equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

Communications Platform   Separation Degrees   One, Inc.  

On January 1, 2016, the Company entered into a technology licensing and marketing support agreement with Separation Degrees   One, Inc. ( SDOI ) that will result in the development, licensing and management of on-going technology solutions and marketing campaigns for ESSI s initiatives.

The Series A Voting Preferred Stock has the right to vote those shares of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock regarding any matter or action that is required to be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval.  The vote of each share of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock is equal to and counted as 10 times the votes of all of the shares of the Company s (i) common stock, and (ii) other voting preferred stock issued and outstanding on the date of each and every vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company regarding each and every matter submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval.

NOTE 4: INTANGIBLE ASSETS (cont d) 

Communications Platform   Separation Degrees   One, Inc. (continued)  

The Company obtained a third party valuation in respect of the issuance of the Series A Voting Preferred stock and recorded a technology licensing and marketing expense of $35,500 in respect of the valuation report. The third party valuation report was based on the following inputs as at January 1, 2016: (1) price per share of common stock of $0.007; (2) 28,426,349 common shares outstanding; 1,000 Series A Preferred shares issued 1/1/16; (3) A 17.5% premium over the combined common share value for the voting preferences; (4) 284,291,916,349 total voting shares and 284,263,490,000 voting rights represented 99.99% of the total.  

On June 1, 2016,  the Company and SDOI entered into a further amendment to the terms of the aforementioned agreements, which provided for the following:  

(1)   

SDOI will not be issued Series A Preferred Stock initially equal to the current total authorized common shares outstanding of 650,000,000; 

(2)   

Invoices for advertising services billed separately from the $35,000 standard monthly fee will have the same terms as the monthly fee; i.e., the amount invoiced will be paid via the issuance of S-8 shares of ESSI Common Stock (issued at a 30% discount to the market VWAP on the date of payment due or a share price of $0.01, whichever is greater). 

On October 1, 2016, monthly standard fee increased to $42,000 from $35,000. 

As of January 31, 2016,  1,000  Series A Voting Preferred Stock had not yet been issued and $35,500 remained on the balance sheets as liabilities for issuance of shares. As of October 31, 2016, 1,000 Series A Voting Preferred Stock was reversed and $nil remained on the balance sheets as liabilities for issuance of shares.  

Further under the terms of the aforementioned technology licensing and marketing support agreement, the Company agreed to the issuance and DWAC of $35,000 worth of S-8 shares in ESSI Common Stock (issued at a 30% discount to the market close on the date of payment due (the 1st of every month), or a share price of $0.01 whichever is greater), to SDOI for ongoing monthly project and planned technical development/maintenance, production and staging server administration, ongoing marketing services and monthly advertising management.   The shares are to be issued on or before the 1 st  business day of each calendar month. 

On January 4, 2016 the Company entered into a further agreement with SDOI for the purchase of a discrete communications software platform, including custom developed libraries, the consideration for which was the issuance of 500,000 shares of common stock.  The Company recorded the fair market value of $3,500 in respect of the software platform on the date of the agreement as intangible assets on the Company s balance sheet.  

As at fiscal year end the Company evaluated the asset for impairment and determined  recovery of the value of the asset was indeterminate during the present stage of the Company s execution of its business plan.  As a result, we recorded an impairment  loss of $3,500 which was recognized in the profit and loss account.  

As of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016,  500,000 shares of common stock had not yet been issued $3,500 remained on the balance sheet as  liabilities for issuance of shares.  

During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 the Company received invoices for advertising services from SDOI totaling $1,271,274 and further received invoices for monthly project and planned technical development/maintenance, production and staging server administration, ongoing marketing services and monthly advertising management services totaling a cumulative $322,000.  The Company determined the value of the shares issuable to settle the total amounts invoiced ($1,593,274) at a 30% discount to fair market value on the settlement date and  recorded a loss of  $684,748 in relation to the shares issuable.  During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 a total of 4,807,953 shares of common stock valued between $0.01 to 0.474 per share in relation to  the aforementioned agreements  with SDOI were issued. A total of $2,044,448 was recorded on the Company s balance sheets as liability for issuance of common shares (2016 - $108,510). The allocated shares had not yet been issued as at October 31, 2016.

(3)   

On October 1, 2015 the Company issued its former President a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $59,000 for unpaid compensation.  The note bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum, matures on October 1, 2017, and contains a repayment provision which permits the holder to convert the debt into the Company's common stock at a rate of 80% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of conversion.

The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on December 8, 2009 under the name Pristine Solutions, Inc.  Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Eco Science Solutions, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is charged with the research and exploration of eco-friendly technology and properties. On February 14, 2014, the Company changed its name to Eco Science Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: ESSI).  

On November 4, 2013, through the Agreements for the License of Intellectual Property "(the "License Agreements"), the Company acquired an exclusive license to the EcoFlora Spark Plug (the  EcoFlora Plug ), a unique product with technology for which the US Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) issued Patent #8,853,925 on October 7, 2014.

On August 31, 2015, the Company executed an Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 28, 2015 (the "Purchase Agreement") with Kensington Marketing, Inc., a Nevada corporation, to acquire a certain technology application known as  Stay Hydrated.

Results of Operations  

Comparison of the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015  

The following summary of the Company s results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2016: 

Revenue  

The Company has only recently launched its current business activity and has not yet generated revenues from its primary business operation.

Cost of sales  

To date the Company has not yet recorded revenues in respect to its primary business activities.  Costs of sales are expected to include advertising fees, commission fees associated with the download of our apps and sales of online products, server fees and other associated expenditures related to production of content for our blogs. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

Comparison of the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015  

The following summary of the Company s results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended October 31, 2016: 

Revenue  

The Company has only recently launched its current business activity and has not yet generated revenues from its primary business operation. 

6 

Cost of sales  

To date the Company has not yet recorded revenues in respect to its primary business activities.  Costs of sales are expected to include advertising fees, commission fees associated with the download of our apps and sales of online products, server fees and other associated expenditures related to production of content for our blogs. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

Plan of Operation  

We have recently changed the focus of our business to operate in the eco-friendly technology sector using social media sites and offering apps to generate advertising revenues and download fees.  The Company's need for ongoing capital by way of loans, sale of equity and/or convertible notes is expected to continue during the current fiscal year until we can establish revenues from operations. We are presently financing ongoing licensing support and maintenance fees associated with our newly commenced business focus by the issuance of shares of common stock for services at a discount to our market price. There are no assurances additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms. 

Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future funding might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive. 

Going Concern  

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues to date and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future.  As at October 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,901,810 and an accumulated deficit of $12,542,076. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $71,008, and total current liabilities of $2,972,818 as compared to $6,706 in current assets and $716,511 in total current liabilities at the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. The Company has limited financial resources available outside loans from its officers and directors and funds it has obtained through use of convertible debt instruments and loans with third parties.  While the Company is working towards generating revenue to offset some of its existing operating expenditures, it is possible that without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. In order for the Company to remain a Going Concern it may need to find additional capital. Presently the Company is financing many of its key expenditures by way of issuance of shares to its key creditors for services provided and fees incurred. Additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders), or from other available funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. During the most recently completed fiscal year management has obtained additional funding with success, however there is no guarantee we will be able to continue to obtain financing if and when required. The current economic downturn may make it difficult to find new capital sources for the Company should they be required.

Cash flows from operating activities  

During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company used $200,862 and $56,660 of cash flow for operating activities respectively. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to an increase in costs during the period associated with the Company s new operational focus.  During the period ended October 31, 2016 the Company recorded liabilities from unissued shares of $1,557,774 and $684,748 loss on shares issued for fees and services with no comparative expense in the nine months ended October 31, 2015.  In addition, during the period the Company incurred related party payables of $126,302 as compared to (3,250) in the nine months ended October 31, 2015 and reported an increase to accounts payable of $49,640 (2016) as compared to an increase of only $17,803 in 2015.  Finally, the Company recorded a substantive reduction to share based compensation in the nine months ended October 31, 2016 of only $25,000 compared to $453,750 in the nine months ended October 31, 2015. Prepaid expenses increased by $817 in the current nine months as compared to Nil in the period ended October 31, 2015. 

Cash flows from investing activities  

During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 the Company expended $2,263 to purchase equipment as compared to $Nil in the nine months ended October 31, 2015. 

Cash flows from financing activities  

During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 the Company received proceeds from related party loans totaling $35,000 as compared to $50,000 in the prior comparative period and repaid $5,000 in the current period as opposed to Nil in the prior comparative nine months.  During the nine months ended October 31, 2016, the Company received proceeds from third party loans totaling $244,110 as compared to $Nil in the prior comparative period. In addition, the Company expended $7,500 with respect to its share buyback program and returned 1,000,000 shares to treasury with no similar transaction in the nine months ended October 31, 2015. 

Future Financings  

We anticipate continuing to rely on related party and third party loans and/or equity sales of our common shares and/or shares for services rendered in order to continue to fund our business operations in the event of ongoing operational shortfalls. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our research and development activities. 

Contractual Obligations  

The Company is a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1934 and we are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, contingencies, litigation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements. There have been no material changes to these policies during the nine months ended October 31, 2016.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

I n October 2016, the  Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")  No. 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Topic 740): This update simplifies the accounting for the income tax consequences of transfers of assets from one unit of a corporation to another unit or subsidiary by eliminating an accounting exception that prevents the recognition of current and deferred income tax consequences for such  intra-entity transfers  until the assets have been sold to an outside party. The amendment should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early application permitted. The standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Under existing accounting guidance, tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies arising from the vesting of share-based payments are recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The new guidance will require such benefits or deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the statement of operations.  Companies are required to apply the new guidance prospectively. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Further, the lease requires a finance lease to recognize both an interest expense and an amortization of the associated expense. Operating leases generally recognize the associated expense on a straight line basis. ASU 2016-02 requires the Company to adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach and adoption beginning on January 1, 2019. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This new standard provides guidance on how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value. This standard requires that entities measure certain equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
