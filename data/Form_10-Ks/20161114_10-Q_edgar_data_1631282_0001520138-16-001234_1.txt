NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS  

Datasea Inc. (the  Company ) was
incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 26, 2014 under the name Rose Rock Inc. and changed its name to Datasea Inc. on
May 27, 2015 by amending its articles of incorporation. 

On May 26, 2015, the Company s founder,
Xingzhong Sun, sold 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock )
to Zhixin Liu, one of the owners of Shuhai Skill (HK) as defined below. On October 27, 2016, Mr. Sun sold his remaining 5,000,000
shares of Common Stock of the Company to Ms. Liu. 

On October 29, 2015, the Company entered
into a share exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with the shareholders (the  Shareholders )
of Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited ( Shuhai Skill (HK) ), a limited liability company incorporated on May
15, 2015 under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China (the
 PRC ). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Shareholders, who together own 100% of the ownership
rights in Shuhai Skill (HK), transferred all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Shuhai Skill (HK) to the
Company in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 4,000,000 (20,000,000 after the forward split described in Note 9)
shares of Common Stock, thereby causing Shuhai Skill (HK) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tianjin Information Sea
Information Technology Co., Ltd. ( Tianjin Information ), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws
of the PRC, and Harbin Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd. ( Harbin Information ), a limited
liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC, to become wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and Shuhai
Information Technology Co., Ltd., also a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC ( Shuhai
Beijing ), to become a variable interest entity ( VIE ) of the Company through a series of contractual
agreements between Shuhai Beijing and Tianjin Information. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, with Shuhai
Skill (HK) and its subsidiaries being the accounting survivor. Accordingly, the historical financial statements presented are
those of Shuhai Skill (HK). 

Following the Share Exchange, the Shareholders,
being Zhixin Liu and her father, Fu Liu, owned approximately 85.45% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. As of October 29,
2015, there were 55,000,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, 47,000,000 of which were beneficially owned by Zhixin
Liu and Fu Liu. 

After the Share Exchange, the Company, through
its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIE entities, is engaged in the business of providing Internet security products, new media advertising,
micro-marketing, and data analysis services in the PRC.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying
u naudited condensed  consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company
has not generated any revenues since inception, has an accumulated deficit of $1,594,424 at September 30, 2016, and has incurred
losses since inception. These circumstances, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The Company s management recognizes that
the Company must generate sales and additional resources to enable it to continue to develop its operations. Based on increased
demand for internet services in China, including internet security and big data integration, the Company s management team
expects a healthy growth in its business. The Company s management intends to raise additional financing through debt and
equity financing or through other means that it deems necessary, with a view to moving forward and sustaining prolonged growth
in its initial phases. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital.

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation  

The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its 100% owned subsidiaries
of  Shuhai Skill (HK) ), Tianjin Information, Harbin Information and Shuhai Beijing.   

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments
and elimination of intercompany transactions upon consolidation) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present
the operating results for the respective periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in the annual condensed
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended June 30, 2016.
The results of the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
the full year ending June 30, 2017.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (Continued) 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant areas requiring the
use of management estimates include, but are not limited to, estimated useful life and residual value of property, plant and equipment,
provision for staff benefit, recognition and measurement of deferred income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions management may undertake in the
future, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial
statements. 

Contingencies  

Certain conditions
may exist as of the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the
Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s management and
legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing
loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such
proceedings, the Company s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as
well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought. If the assessment of a contingency indicates
that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability
would be accrued in the Company s financial statements. 

If the assessment
indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated,
the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would
be disclosed. 

START-UP
COSTS  

In accordance with
ASC 720,  Start-up Costs,  the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization
of the Company.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (Continued) 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or
less. The Company has no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 

Property and equipment are stated at cost,
less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs and improvements that significantly extend original useful lives or improve productivity
are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When property and
equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts,and
any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method
over estimated useful lives as follows: 

Furniture and fixtures   
      5-10 years   
 
      Office equipment  
      3-5 years   

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a
straight-line method over the shorter of estimated useful lives or lease terms. 

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Intangible assets
with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. Evaluation of the recoverability
of intangible assets is made to take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that
indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. The Company acquired Value added telecommunications
business license on September 28, 2015.     
No impairment of intangible assets has been identified as of the balance sheet dates.  

Intangible assets include licenses and certificates
and are amortized over their useful life of five years.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES 

FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements, 
defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure
requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.   

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   

Certain of the Company s financial instruments,
including cash, accrued expenses and other payables, are carried at costs, which approximate their fair values due to their short
maturities.   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not
identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value on a recurring basis. 

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

In accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, or it is reasonably possible
that these assets 

could become impaired as a result of technological
or other industrial changes. The determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is made by comparing the carrying
amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. 

If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of
the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. During the
reporting periods there was no impairment loss recognized on long-lived assets.

POLICIES  (Continued) 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenues from professional
services contracts. Customers are billed, according to individual agreements. Revenues from professional services are recognized
on a completed-contract basis, in accordance with ASC Topic 605-35,  Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. 
Under the completed-contract basis, contract costs are recorded to projects in process and billings and/or cash received are recorded
to a deferred revenue liability account during the periods of construction. Costs include direct material, direct labor and subcontract
labor. All revenues, costs, and profits are recognized in operations upon completion of the contract. A contract is considered
completed when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred and final acceptance has been received from the customer.
Corporate general and administrative expenses are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract
is foreseen, the Company will recognize the loss as incurred. For uncompleted contracts, the deferred asset (accumulated contract
costs) in excess of the deferred liability (billings and/or cash received) is classified under current assets as costs in excess
of billings on uncompleted contracts. The deferred liability (billings and/or cash received) in excess of the deferred asset (accumulated
contract costs) is classified under current liabilities as billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts. Contract retentions
are included in accounts receivable. 

In January 2016, the Company secured a government
procurement contract with the Bureau of Public Security of Daqing City in Heilongjiang Province. As of September 30, 2016, the
project has not been completed. 

INCOME TAXES  

The Company uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense
is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary
differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided
to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely
than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods
presented.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   

The Company maintains cash in accounts with
state-owned banks within the PRC. Cash in state-owned banks is not covered by insurance. Should any of these institutions holding
the Company s cash become insolvent, or if the Company is unable to withdraw funds for any reason, the Company could lose
the cash on deposit with that institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed
to any risks on its cash in these bank accounts. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  

The accounts of the
Company s Chinese subsidiary are maintained in RMB and the accounts of the U.S. parent company are maintained in USD. The
accounts of the Chinese subsidiary were translated into USD in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic 830  Foreign Currency Matters.  All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date; stockholders  equity is translated at historical rates and statement of income items are translated at the weighted
average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income in accordance
with ASC Topic 220,  Comprehensive Income.  Gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency transactions are reflected
in the statements of income.  

The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10,
 Comprehensive Income.  Comprehensive income comprises net income and all changes to the statements of stockholders 
equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring
that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting
periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2015 (fiscal year 2017 for the Company). The Company adopted
this guidance, prospectively, as of November 30, 2015. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842)  to increase the transparency and comparability about leases among entities. The new guidance requires
lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. It also requires additional
disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (Continued) 

In April 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments
clarity the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance.
The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for
the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. Public entities should apply the amendments
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein (i.e., January 1, 2018,
for a calendar year entity). Early application for public entities is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of this new standard on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which is intended to not change
the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606, but rather affect only the narrow aspects of Topic 606 by reducing the potential
for diversity in practice at initial application and by reducing the cost and complexity of applying Topic 606 both at transition
and on an ongoing basis. The Company is assessing the impact of the adoption of the ASU on its unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, disclosure requirements and methods of adoption.

Overview and Recent Developments  

The Company was incorporated in the
State of Nevada on September 26, 2014 under the name Rose Rock Inc. and changed its name to the current name on May 27, 2015 by
amending its articles of incorporation. 

On October 29, 2015, the Company entered
into an exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Ms. Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu, the shareholders ( Shareholders )
of Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited ( Shuhai Skill (HK) ). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the
Shareholders, who together owned 100% of the ordinary shares of Shuhai Skill (HK), transferred all of the issued and outstanding
ordinary shares of Shuhai Skill (HK) to the Company in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of the Company s
Common Stock, thereby causing Shuhai Skill (HK) and its wholly foreign owned subsidiaries, Tianjin Information Sea Information
Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC ( Tianjin Information ), and
Harbin Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC ( Harbin
Information ) became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and Shuahi Information Technology Co., Ltd., also a limited
liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC ( Shuhai Beijing ), became the Company s variable interest
entity. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, with Shuhai Skill (HK) and its subsidiaries being the accounting
survivor. Accordingly, the historical financial statements presented are those of Shuhai Skill (HK). 

On October 27, 2015, the Company s
founder, Xingzhong Sun, sold all his 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company to Zhixin Liu. Following the transaction,
Zhixin Liu and her father, Fu Liu, beneficially owned approximately 85.45% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. As of October
29, 2015, there were 55,000,000 (post-split) shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, 45,000,000 of which were owned by Zhixin
Liu and Fu Liu. 

On November 12, 2015, the Company effected
a five-for-one forward split (the  Forward Split ) of the Common Stock, pursuant to which each shareholder of the Company
was issued five shares of Common Stock in exchange for each share of their then-issued Common Stock. In conjunction with the Forward
Split, the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock increased from 75,000,000 shares to 375,000,000 shares. Immediately
following the Forward Split, the Company had a total of 55,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. 

Following the reverse merger, the Company,
through its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIE, is in the business of providing Internet security products, new media advertising,
micro-marketing, and data analysis services in the PRC. 

The Company started to sell its products
during the calendar year 2016. In January 2016, the Company secured a government procurement contract with the Bureau of Public
Security of Daqing City in Heilongjiang Province. Pursuant to the contract, the Company will install wireless internet terminal
collection equipment and 3G wireless network cards, as well as provide training services related to the use of the equipment for
a total contract price of RMB1,005,000 (approximately $162,844). As of the date of this report, the Company has completed the installation
of this project, and is waiting for acceptance from the Bureau of Public Security of Daqing City. The Company will recognize revenue
for this project upon acceptance by the customer.

The Company believes that the increased
demand for internet security equipment and related services in China, including internet security, micro marketing, new media advertising
and big data integration, presents a great opportunity for the Company to establish and grow its business in the next twelve months
and the Company expects to start generating revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.

management s forecast of operating cash flows, management has determined that the Company will require additional funds to
finance our planed operations for the next twelve months. 

- 18 - 

        Table of Contents  

Due to our negative cash flow from operating
activities and no revenue generated yet since inception, our auditors expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company s management recognizes that the Company must generate sales and additional resources
to continue to develop its operations. Based on increased demand for internet services in China, including internet security and
big data integration, the Company expects to generate revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, which will be used to
fund its operations. In addition, the Company intends to raise additional funds through debt and equity financing or through other
means that it deems necessary. However, there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable
to the Company, if at all.

a noncash adjustment of $6,341, a change in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $28,486, and accounts payable of $12,663.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

This item is not applicable as we are
currently considered a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of
the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our company s management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which
are indicative of many small companies with a small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment;
(ii) lack of personnel adequately trained in U.S. GAAP; and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and
financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both U.S. GAAP and SEC guidelines. Management anticipates
that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the above material weaknesses are remediated. 

We plan to take steps to enhance and
improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this report, we have not been
able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes
during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel
to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon our securing additional
financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts
may be adversely affected in a material manner.

        Table of Contents  

Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
