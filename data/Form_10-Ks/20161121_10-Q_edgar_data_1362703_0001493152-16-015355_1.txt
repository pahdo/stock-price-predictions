NOTE
1 -  ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS    

OncBioMune
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Nevada on March 18, 2005, as PediatRx, Inc. From July 2010 until early fiscal year 2014, the Company
engaged in the pharmaceutical business. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014, the Company divested itself of the balance
of its pharmaceutical assets and engaged in the digital media business.  

Acquisition
of OncBioMune, Inc.    

Upon
completion of a share exchange between our company and the shareholders of OncBioMune, Inc. ( ONC ) on September 2,
2015 as previously disclosed, we became a biotechnology company specializing in innovative cancer therapies. We have proprietary
rights to a breast and prostate cancer therapeutic vaccines, a process for the growth of cancer cells and targeted chemotherapies.
Our mission is to improve the overall patient condition through innovative immunotherapy with proven treatment protocols.  

Oncbiomune
M xico, S.A. De C.V.    

As
previously disclosed, on August 19, 2016, the Company and Vitel Laboratorios S.A. de C.V. ( Vitel ), a Mexico-based
pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes high specialty drugs in Mexico and other Latin American countries, entered
into a Shareholders  Agreement related to the launch of Oncbiomune M xico, S.A. De C.V. ( Oncbiomune Mexico )
for the purposes of developing and commercializing the Company s PROSCAVAX vaccine technology and cancer technologies in
M xico, Central and Latin America ( MALA ). Under the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, the Company has
agreed to assign to Oncbiomune Mexico limited patent and intellectual property rights and trademarks related to our OVCAVAX, PROSCAVAX
vaccine technology and cancer technologies and future developments related to these technologies. These rights will permit Oncbiomune
Mexico to use and develop these technologies in MALA.  

Planned
Acquisition of Vitel     

On
November 2, 2016, we signed a non-binding term sheet to acquire Vitel as contemplated when we entered into the Shareholders 
Agreement. Pursuant to the term sheet, our planned acquisition of Vitel will be structured as an all-stock transaction with both
OncBioMune and Vitel contributing equity interests into a newly created trust, resulting in Vitel operating as a wholly owned
subsidiary of OncBioMune.  

Basis
of presentation and principles of consolidation   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiary, ONC. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation  

Management
acknowledges its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
which reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement
of its financial position and the results of its operations for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (the  U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions Article 8-03 of Regulation
S-X. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year
as a whole. Certain information and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP has been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to such accounting principles and, accordingly, they do not
include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial statements These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 of ONC which were included in the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2016.

Going
concern   

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,388,859 and $341,748 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The net cash used in operations were $1,155,203 and $378,559 for nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,518,078 and $1,129,219, at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and had no revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Effective September
2, 2015, the Company entered into the Exchange Agreement which changed the nature of its business and management. Management cannot
provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional
debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that the Company s capital resources are not currently adequate to continue
operating and maintaining its business strategy for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The Company will seek to raise capital
through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future. Although the Company has historically raised
capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue
to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects
that the Company will need to curtail or cease operations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Significant estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include the useful life of
property and equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, estimates of current and deferred income
taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions.  

Fair
value of financial instruments and fair value measurements   

FASB ASC 820    Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures,  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value
of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of
financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on September 30, 2016. Accordingly, the estimates
presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of
the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation
techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level
    1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   

Level
    2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
    similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs
    derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   

Level
    3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.   

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, employee loans, prepaid expenses, loans payable, line of
credit payable, payroll liabilities, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair market value based on
the short-term maturity of these instruments. The Company accounts for one instrument at fair value using level 3 valuation.  

A roll forward of the level 3 valuation financial instruments
is as follows: 

ASC
825-10   Financial Instruments   ,  allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets
and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and
is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and
losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply
the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties,
compensation expense is recognized over the service period of the award.  

Basic
and diluted earnings per share   

Pursuant
to ASC 260-10-45, basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted income per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during each period. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock or other contracts to issue common stock resulting in the issuance
of common stock that would then share in the Company s income (loss) subject to anti-dilution limitations.  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Basic
and diluted earnings per share (continued)   

Potentially
dilutive common shares consist of common stock issuable for stock warrants (using the treasury stock method). These common stock
equivalents may be dilutive in the future. All potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted
shares outstanding as they would have an anti-dilutive impact on the Company s net losses and consisted of the following:  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern,  that will require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related
footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management will assess if there
is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date. Substantial
doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date.
The new standard defines substantial doubt and provides example indicators. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise
to substantial doubt. However, management will need to assess if its plans will alleviate substantial doubt to determine the specific
disclosures. This standard is effective for public entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier application
of this standard is permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.  

On
January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 to amend the accounting guidance on the classification and measurement of financial
instruments. The standard requires that all investments in equity securities, including other ownership interests, are carried
at fair value through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for equity method accounting or
to those that result in consolidation of the investee or for which the entity has elected the predictability exception to fair
value measurement. Additionally, the standard requires that the portion of the total fair value change caused by a change in instrument-specific
credit risk for financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected would be recognized in other comprehensive
income. Any accumulated amount remaining in other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings when the liability is extinguished.
The Company does not anticipate the guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or notes to its
consolidated financial statements.  

On
February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ) to amend the accounting guidance for leases. The
accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02. However, the standard requires lessees to recognize lease
assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases on the balance sheet. Lessees will recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election
by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it will recognize
lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance
on its consolidated financial statements and notes to its consolidated financial statements.

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ) to amend the accounting guidance for share-based payment
accounting. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are
not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.  

NOTE
3    LINE OF CREDIT    

In
October 2014, ONC entered into a $100,000 revolving promissory note (the  Revolving Note ) with Regions Bank (the
 Lender ). The unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Note is payable on demand and any unpaid principal and interest
is payable due not later than October 27, 2017, is secured by deposits located at the Lender, and bears interest computed at a
variable rate of interest which is equal to the Lender s prime rate plus 1.7% (5.20% and 5.20% at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively). ONC will pay to Lender a late charge of 5.0% of any monthly payment not received by Lender within
10 calendar days after its due date. The Company may, at any time or from time to time, prepay the Revolving Note in whole or
in part without penalty.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $98,741 and $49,708, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the
Revolving Note with $1,259 and $50,292, respectively, available for borrowing under such note. The weighted average interest rate
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 5.20%.  

NOTE
4    CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE    

On
May 23, 2016, the Company entered into a $40,000 convertible promissory note (the  Convertible Note ) with Crown Bridge
Partners, LLC (the  Lender ). The unpaid principal and interest is payable no later than May 22, 2017 and bears interest
computed at a rate of interest which is equal to 8.0% per annum. Any amount of principal or interest on this Convertible Note,
which is not paid by the maturity date, shall bear interest at the rate of 22% per annum from the due date until paid. The Company
may prepay any amount outstanding under the Convertible Note by making a payment to the Lender of an amount in cash equal as follow:  

The
prepayment is subject to the Lender s prior written acceptance in the Lender s sole discretion. The Company may not
prepay any amount outstanding under the Convertible Note after the 180 th  day after the issuance of the Convertible
Note.  

The
Lender is entitled, at their option, at any time after the issuance of the Convertible Note, to convert all or any lesser portion
of the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest into the Company s common stock. The Conversion Price
is the Variable Conversion Price ( VCP ) as defined in the Convertible Note and subject, in each case, to equitable
adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company s securities or
the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions
and similar events. VCP means 58% multiplied by the  Market Price , which is calculated as the lowest trading price,
as defined, for the Company s common stock during the twenty trading day period ending on the last complete trading day
prior to the conversion date. If at any time while the Convertible Note is outstanding, the lowest trading prices for the Company s
common stock is equal to or lower than $0.10, then an additional discount of five percent (5%) will be factored into the VCP until
the Convertible Note is no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 47% assuming no other adjustments are triggered
hereunder). In the event that shares of the Company s common stock are not deliverable via DWAC following the conversion
of any amount thereunder, an additional five percent (5%) discount shall be factored into the VCP until the Convertible Note is
no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 47% assuming no other adjustments are triggered hereunder).

In
connection with the issuance of the Convertible Note above, the Company determined that the terms of the Convertible Note include
a down-round provision under which the conversion price and exercise price could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken
by the Company or contain terms that are not fixed monetary amounts at inception.  

Accordingly,
under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 815-40,  Derivatives and Hedging   Contracts in an Entity s Own Stock ,
the embedded conversion option contained in the convertible instruments were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date
of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion
option derivatives was determined using the Black- Scholes Option Pricing Model. On the initial measurement date, the fair values
of the embedded conversion option derivative of $76,012 was recorded as a derivative liability and was allocated as a debt discount
up to the net proceeds of the Convertible Note of $36,000 with the remainder of $40,012 charged to current period operations as
initial derivative expense. At the end of each period, the Company revalues the embedded conversion option derivative liabilities.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, aggregate derivative income (expense) from changes in fair value of derivative
liabilities and the initial derivative expense amounted to $109,858 and $(34,648), respectively, which is recorded as a component
of other income/(expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liabilities was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions:  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discounts related to these convertible note amounted
to $10,000 and $14,167, respectively, which has been included in interest expense on the accompanying statements of operations.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Convertible Note consisted of the following:  

At
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had $40,000 and $0, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the
Convertible Note. The weighted average interest rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately

Common
stock purchase agreement    

On
October 20, 2015, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), together with a registration
rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park ).
Upon signing the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park agreed to purchase 333,334 shares of the Company s common stock for $100,000
or $0.30 per share as an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement.  

Under
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to, and Lincoln Park is obligated
to purchase, up to an additional $10.0 million in amounts of shares, as described below, of the Company s common stock,
subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing on the date that a registration statement,
which the Company agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus in connection therewith is filed. The Company may direct
Lincoln Park, at its sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 50,000 shares of Common Stock on any
business day (such purchases,  Regular Purchases ), provided that at least one business day has passed since the most
recent purchase, and provided, however that Lincoln Park s committed obligation under any single Regular Purchase shall
not exceed $50,000, provided that the amount the Company may sell to Lincoln Park under a single Regular Purchase may increase
under certain circumstances as described in the Purchase Agreement but in no event will the amount of a single Regular Purchase
exceed $500,000. The purchase price of shares of Common Stock related to the future funding will be based on the prevailing market
prices of such shares at the time of sales. In addition, the Company may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as
accelerated purchases if on the date of a Regular Purchase the closing sale price of the Common Stock is not below the threshold
price as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Company s sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase
Agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its
affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.  

In
connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued as a commitment fee to Lincoln Park 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
Lincoln Park represented to the Company, among other things, that it was an  accredited investor  (as such term is
defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act )), and the
Company sold the securities in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities
Act. The securities sold may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration
requirements.  

The
Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions
to completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. The Company has the right to terminate
the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase
Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market
conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for
the Company and its operations. Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by the Company, but is obligated to make purchases
from the Company as it directs in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in
any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our shares.  

The
net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares
of its stock to Lincoln Park. The Company expects that any proceeds received by the Company from such sales to Lincoln Park under
the Purchase Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements.  

In
July and September   2016, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
with Lincoln Park dated October 20, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 400,000 shares of its common stock to Lincoln
Park for net proceeds of $76,510.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking
information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking
statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance.
We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as  anticipate,   estimate, 
 expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,   will 
and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome
of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that could cause our actual results of operations
and financial condition to differ materially are set forth in the  Risk Factors  section of our annual report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on April 13, 2016.  

We
caution that these factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement
is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to
time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on
our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

Overview   

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 18, 2005. From 2010 until 2013, we engaged in the pharmaceutical
business. During 2013, we decided to divest of the balance of our pharmaceutical assets and engage in the digital media business.  

Acquisition
of OncBioMune, Inc. and our operations    

Upon
completion of a share exchange between our company and the shareholders of OncBioMune, Inc. ( ONC ) on September 2,
2015 as previously disclosed, we became a biotechnology company specializing in innovative cancer therapies. We have proprietary
rights to a breast and prostate cancer therapeutic vaccines, a process for the growth of cancer cells and targeted chemotherapies.
Our mission is to improve the overall patient condition through innovative immunotherapy with proven treatment protocols.  

Our
current product portfolio consists of three target therapies and a vaccine platform that allows us to create a therapeutic vaccine
for any solid tumor cancer. The vaccine platform has treated over 300 patients. We are in the planning stage of a Phase 2 clinical
trial of our lead product, ProscaVax . The trial will be under the direction of Glenn Bubley, MD and the lead site will be
Harvard s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, with additional other hospitals in the Harvard Health System. The trial
will expand the results that we found in our Phase 1 clinical trial in a different patient population. We expect to file a new
drug application after the completion of the Phase 2 trial. We also hope to develop our other proprietary technologies, such as
the paclitaxel-albumin conjugate with regard to which we plan to file an orphan drug indication within the next two years.  

Oncbiomune
M xico, S.A. De C.V.    

On
August 19, 2016, we entered into a Shareholders Agreement (the  Shareholders Agreement ) with Vitel Laboratorios,
S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company ( Vitel ) related to their ownership of Oncbiomune M xico, S.A. De C.V., a
Mexican company ( Oncbiomune Mexico ). Oncbiomune Mexico was launched for the purposes of developing and commercializing
our PROSCAVAX vaccine technology and cancer technologies in M xico, Central and Latin America ( MALA ) for
the treatment of prostate, ovarian and various other types of cancer. Vitel is an unrelated third party. Under the terms of the
Shareholders Agreement, we have agreed to assign to Oncbiomune Mexico and its affiliates limited patent and intellectual property
rights and trademarks related to our OVCAVAX, PROSCAVAX vaccine technology and cancer technologies and future developments related
to these technologies. These rights will permit Oncbiomune Mexico to use and develop these technologies in MALA. Oncbiomune Mexico
is currently conducting patient screening in Mexico for a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating ProscaVax in PSA recurrent prostate cancer
in hormone-na ve and hormone-independent patients.  

Planned
Acquisition of Vitel     

On
November 2, 2016, we signed a non-binding term sheet to acquire Vitel as contemplated when we entered into the Shareholders 
Agreement. Pursuant to the term sheet, our planned acquisition of Vitel will be structured as an all-stock transaction with both
OncBioMune and Vitel contributing equity interests into a newly created trust, resulting in Vitel operating as a wholly owned
subsidiary of OncBioMune. Upon completion of the acquisition of Vitel, Manuel Cosme Odabachian, Chief Executive Officer of Vitel,
is expected to join our company as an executive officer and continue to lead operations in Mexico and abroad.  

Vitel
has a drug portfolio that includes 12 drug candidates licensed for the Mexican market. Late in the third quarter, Vitel commercialized
Bekunis  for constipation and Cirkused  for stress, two over-the-counter products licensed from ROHA Arzneimittel GmbH.
Upon closing the acquisition of Vitel, OncBioMune would immediately begin recognizing revenue from the sales of these products
in Mexico. Vitel is actively working to next commercialize Vesanoid  (tretinoin), an oral retinoid anti-cancer chemotherapy
drug, during the current quarter or early in the first quarter of 2017. Vesanoid has been approved by the Mexican government agency,
the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk (COFEPRIS), for the treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
(APL), the M3 subtype of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Vitel licensed Mexican marketing rights to Vesanoid from German-based
Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH. Also in Vitel s pipeline are KamRAB , a human anti-rabies immune globulin therapy, and
KamRHO , a Rho (D) human immunoglobulin for the suppression of Rh immunization in Rho(D)-negative women delivering a Rho(D)-positive
fetus or when the Rh type of fetus is unknown. Vitel has licensed rights to market these products in Mexico from Kamada Ltd.  

The
acquisition of Vitel is expected to be transformational to our company, as we expect become a revenue-generating biotechnology
company following a rollout of these products and the completion of our planned acquisition of Vitel. We believe that Vitel will
be able to duplicate is success in bringing Bekunis and Cirkused to market in Mexico when we begin marketing efforts in Mexico
and throughout Latin America for other drugs in our pipeline and ProscaVax.  

As
we work towards completing the planned acquisition of Vitel, our two management teams are mapping out a pipeline development and
launch plan for a variety of new products using our combined resources which we expect to be revenue generating.

Revenue   

We
did not generate any revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We expect to begin generating revenues
from product sales in Mexico upon completion of the planned acquisition of Vitel as discussed above.  

Operating
Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses amounted to $461,696 as compared to $220,706 for the three months

amounted to $1,334,321 as compared to $346,367 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $987,954 or 285.2%.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, operating expenses consisted of the following:  

Loss
from Operations   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to $461,696 as compared to $220,706 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $240,990 or 109.2%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations
amounted to $1,334,321 as compared to $346,367 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $987,954 or 285.2%.
This increase is a result of the increase in operating expenses discussed above.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had net total other income of $97,245 as compared to net total other expense of
$(544) for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $97,789. This change was primarily due to the recording of income
from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $109,585 offset by an increase in interest expense of $11,969 due to
an increase in interest-bearing debt. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net total other expense of $(54,538)
as compared to net total other income of $4,583 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $(59,121). The increase
was primarily due to the increase of $34,648 in derivative expense related to a debt financing, and increases in interest expense
related to an increase in borrowings and an increase in the amortization of debt discount of $14,167 which has been included in
interest expense.  

Net
Loss   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $364,451 or $(0.01) per common share (basic and diluted) as compared
to a net loss of $221,250 or $(0.00) per common share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $143,201 or 64.7%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $1,388,859 or $(0.02) per common share
(basic and diluted) as compared to a net loss of $341,784 or $(0.01) per common share (basic and diluted) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,047,075 or 306.4%.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had working capital
of $(375,769) and $10,587 of cash as of September 30, 2016 and working capital of $538,279 and $672,769 of cash as of December
31, 2015.  

From
December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, our working capital decreased by $914,048 and was primarily due to a decrease in cash
of $662,182, an increase in bank line of credit payable of $49,033, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
of $108,534, and an increase in derivative liability of $70,648.  

Cash
Flows   

Changes
in our cash balance are summarized as follows:  

Cash
Used in Operating Activities   

Our
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to our cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased by $776,644. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in
operating activities consisted of our net loss of $1,388,859 adjusted for the add back of non-cash items such as depreciation
expense of $823, stock based compensation of $69,000, amortization of debt discount of $14,167, derivative expense $34,648 and
changes in operating assets and liabilities of $115,018. The increase in use of cash in operating activities was primarily due
to an increase in cash used to pay executive salaries and other employees and related payroll taxes of approximately $536,706
and increase in amounts paid for professional fees, and travel.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operating activities consisted of our net loss of $341,784 adjusted for
changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(36,775).

flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0 as compared to $4,676 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $4,676. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received proceeds from
recapitalization of $4,676.  

Cash
Provided By Financing Activities   

Cash flows provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $493,021 as compared to $457,723 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $35,298. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received net proceeds from our bank line of credit
of $49,033, net proceeds from convertible debt of $36,000, proceeds of $20,000 from related party advances, and proceeds from
the sale of common stock of $387,988. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received net proceeds from convertible
debt of $100,000, proceeds from the sale of common stock of $334,003, net proceeds from our bank line of credit of $32,520, offset
by net payments of related party advances of $(8,800). 

Cash
Requirements   

Our
management does not believe that our current capital resources will be adequate to continue operating our company and maintaining
our business strategy for more than 12 months. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in the near future to meet
our working capital requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or,
if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing
on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.  

Going
Concern   

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,388,859 and $341,784 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The net cash used in operations were $1,155,203 and $378,559 for nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,518,078 at September 30, 2016, and had no revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Effective September 2, 2015, we entered into the Exchange Agreement which changed
the nature of our business and management. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations
or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that our capital resources are
not currently adequate to continue operating and maintaining its business strategy for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
We will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund our operations in the future. Although
we have historically raised capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that
we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future,
management expects that we will need to curtail or cease operations.  

Current
and Future Financings    

In
October 2014, we entered into a $100,000 revolving promissory note (the  Revolving Note ) with Regions Bank (the  Lender ).
The unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Note is payable on demand and any unpaid principal and interest is payable due not
later than October 27, 2017, is secured by deposits located at the Lender, and bears interest computed at a variable rate of interest
which is equal to the Lender s prime rate plus 1.7% (5.20% at September 30, 2016). We will pay to Lender a late charge of
5.0% of any monthly payment not received by Lender within 10 calendar days after its due date. We may, at any time or from time
to time, prepay the Revolving Note in whole or in part without penalty. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $98,741
and $49,708, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Note with $1,259 and $50,292, respectively, available
for borrowing under such note. The weighted average interest rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
5.20%.  

On
October 20, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), together with a registration rights
agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park ).
Upon signing the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park agreed to purchase 333,334 shares of the Company s common stock for $100,000
as an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement,
we have the right to sell to, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, up to an additional $10 million in amounts of shares,
as described below, of our common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing
on the date that a registration statement, which we agreed to file with the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,
is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus in connection therewith is filed. We may direct Lincoln Park, at our sole
discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 50,000 shares of Common Stock on any business day (such purchases,
 Regular Purchases ), provided that at least one business day has passed since the most recent purchase, and provided,
however that Lincoln Park s committed obligation under any single Regular Purchase shall not exceed $50,000, provided that
the amount the Company may sell to Lincoln Park under a single Regular Purchase may increase under certain circumstances as described
in the Purchase Agreement but in no event will the amount of a single Regular Purchase exceed $500,000. The purchase price of
shares of Common Stock related to the future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time
of sales. In addition, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases if on the date of a
Regular Purchase the closing sale price of the Common Stock is not below the threshold price as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
Our sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares
that would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than 4.99%
of the then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.  

In
connection with the Purchase Agreement, we issued as a commitment fee to Lincoln Park 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Lincoln
Park represented to us, among other things, that it was an  accredited investor  (as such term is defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act )), and the Company sold
the securities in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The securities
sold may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  

The
Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions
to completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. We have the right to terminate
the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase
Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions,
the trading price of our Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for us and our operations.
Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with
the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short
selling or hedging of our shares.  

The
net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to us will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares of its
stock to Lincoln Park. We expect that any proceeds received by us from such sales to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement
will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $76,510 and $95,000 under the Purchase Agreement, respectively.  

There
can be no assurance that funding will be available under the Purchase Agreement or if additional financing will be available to
us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of
our business.  

On
May 23, 2016, we issued a $40,000 convertible promissory note (the  Convertible Note ) to Crown Bridge Partners, LLC
(the  Lender ). The unpaid principal and interest is payable no later than May 22, 2017 and bears interest computed
at a rate of interest which is equal to 8.0% per annum. Any amount of principal or interest on the Convertible Note, which is
not paid by the maturity date, shall bear interest at the rate of 22% per annum from the due date until paid.  

We
may prepay any amount outstanding under the Convertible Note by making a payment to the Lender of an amount in cash equal as follow:  

The
prepayment is subject to the Lender s prior written acceptance in the Lender s sole discretion. The Company may not
prepay any amount outstanding under the Convertible Note after the 180 th  day after the issuance of the Convertible
Note.  

The
Lender is entitled, at their option, at any time after the issuance of the Convertible Note, to convert all or any lesser portion
of the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest into the Company s common stock. The Conversion Price
is the Variable Conversion Price ( VCP ) as defined in the Convertible Note and subject, in each case, to equitable
adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company s securities or
the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions
and similar events. VCP means 58% multiplied by the  Market Price , which is calculated as the lowest trading price,
as defined, for the Company s common stock during the twenty trading day period ending on the last complete trading day
prior to the conversion date. If at any time while the Convertible Note is outstanding, the lowest trading prices for the Company s
common stock is equal to or lower than $0.10, then an additional discount of five percent (5%) will be factored into the VCP until
the Convertible Note is no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 47% assuming no other adjustments are triggered
hereunder). In the event that shares of the Company s common stock are not deliverable via DWAC following the conversion
of any amount thereunder, an additional five percent (5%) discount shall be factored into the VCP until the Convertible Note is
no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 47% assuming no other adjustments are triggered hereunder).  

In
connection with the issuance of the Convertible Note above, we determined that the terms of the Convertible Note include a down-round
provision under which the conversion price and exercise price could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by us or
contain terms that are not fixed monetary amounts at inception.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, pursuant to subscription agreements, the Company issued 102,341 shares of its common
stock to investors for cash proceeds of $51,926.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, pursuant to subscription agreements, the Company issued 1,730,362 shares of its common
stock and 865,176 five-year warrants to purchase common shares for $0.30 per common share to investors for cash proceeds of $259,552.  

On
June 1, 2016, we entered into an agreement (the  Agreement ) with Dawson James Securities, Inc., a FINRA member broker-dealer
( Dawson ), pursuant to which the Company invited Dawson to introduce to the Company, on a fully disclosed and non-exclusive
basis, one or more parties that might be interest in participating in an offering (the  Offering ) of the Company s
securities by the Company pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act.  

Dawson s
role is to (i) refer a potential party that may be interested in the Offering to the Company (each, a  Prospect ),
and (ii) if the Company so requests, assist in contacting, communicating or setting meeting with such Prospects and, if appropriate,
to provide all deal services and functions relating to any transactions resulting from the Offering. Pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement, in no event shall a Prospect be deemed a customer of Dawson for purposes of the Offering; nor shall Dawson be required
to make a sale to the Prospect under the Agreement. To the contrary, Dawson shall not make any sales in the Offering and has no
power to bind the Company.  

At
the closing of the Offering, the Company shall compensate Dawson as follows: (i) the Company shall pay to Dawson 8% of the gross
proceeds invested by all Prospects in the Offering, and (ii) the Company shall issue to Dawson warrants to purchase that number
of securities equal to 8% of the aggregate number of securities sold to Prospects in the Offering.  

The
Agreement may be terminated for any reason by either party upon 30 days  prior written notice to the other party.  

We
will require additional financing to fund our planned operations. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing
and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly, if the volatile conditions of the stock and financial markets,
and more particularly the market for early development stage company stocks persist.  

There
can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed,
we will be forced to further delay or further scale down some or all of our activities or perhaps even cease the operations of
the business.  

Since
inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund
our operations through the equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. If we are able to raise additional
financing by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders  ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial or other
loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  

There
is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his, her,
or its investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

We
have identified the following policies as critical to its business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted
by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments.
These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact
quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly
as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.  

Research
and development    

Research
and development costs incurred in the development of the Company s products are expensed as incurred.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties,
compensation expense is recognized over the service period of the award.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to our stockholders.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
controls and procedures    

We
maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures include
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

The
ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting: (1) the lack of multiple levels of management review of material contracts and expenses, and (2) a lack
of adequate segregation of duties relating to the initiation of transactions and payments to vendors. Until such time as we expand
our staff to include additional accounting personnel, it is likely that we will continue to report material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Financing
Transaction - General    

On November 18, 2016 (the  Original Issue Date ) the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the  Securities Purchase Agreement ) with certain institutional investors (the  Purchasers )
for the sale of the Company s convertible notes and warrants. Pursuant to the terms provided for in the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Company agreed to issue upon closing to the Purchasers for an aggregate subscription amount of $300,000: (i) 10%
Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the  Notes ); and (ii) warrants (the  Warrants )
to purchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) at
an exercise price of $0.175 (subject to adjustments under certain conditions as defined in the Warrants). The closing date under
the Securities Purchase Agreement is expected to occur no later than November 30, 2016.  

The
Notes.   The aggregate principal amount of the Notes is $300,000 and the Company will receive $270,000 after giving effect to
the 10% original issue discount. The Notes bear interest at a rate equal to 10% per annum (which interest rate is increased to
24% per annum upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes)), have a maturity date of July 21, 2017 and
are convertible (principal, and interest) at any time after the issuance date of the Notes into shares of the Company s
Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.15 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in the Note), provided, however,
that if an event of default has occurred, regardless of whether such Event of Default has been cured or remains ongoing, the Note
shall be convertible at 60% of the lowest closing price during the prior twenty trading days of the Common Stock as reported on
the OTCQB or other principal trading market (the  Default Conversion Price ). The Notes provide for two amortization
payments on the six-month, seven-month and eight-month anniversary of the issue date with each amortization payment being one
third of the total outstanding principal and interest. If the six-month amortization payment is made in cash then the payment
is an amount equal to 120% of the applicable amortization payment and if the seven-month or the eight-month amortization payments
are made in cash then the payment is an amount equal to 125% of the applicable amortization payment. The Notes may be prepaid
at any time until the 180th day following the Original Issue Date at an amount equal to (i) 115% of outstanding principal balance
of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest during the period from the Original Issue Date through the three months following
the Original Issue Date, and (ii) 120% of outstanding principal balance of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest during months
four through six following the Original Issue Date. In order to prepay the Notes, the Company shall provide 20 Trading Days prior
written notice to the Holder, during which time the Holder may convert the Notes in whole or in part at the Conversion Price.  

The
Notes contain certain covenants, such as restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, payment of restricted
payments, redemptions, payment of cash dividends and the transfer of assets. The Notes also contains certain adjustment provisions
that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transactions. The
conversion price is subject to adjustment if we issue or sell shares of our common stock for a consideration per share less than
the conversion price then in effect, or issue options, warrants or other securities convertible or exchange for shares of our
common stock at a conversion or exercise price less than the conversion price of the Notes then in effect. If either of these
events should occur, the conversion price is reduced to the lowest price at which these securities were issued or are exercisable.
We granted the Purchasers certain rights of first refusal on future offerings by us for as long as the Purchasers hold the Notes.
In addition, subject to limited exceptions, the Purchasers will not have the right to convert any portion of the Note if the Purchaser,
together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of the Company s Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to its conversion. The Purchaser may increase or decrease this ownership limitation
to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% upon 61 days prior written notice to us. In addition, we granted the Purchasers certain
rights of first refusal on future offerings by us for as long as the Purchasers hold the Notes.  

The
Warrants  . As described above, holders of the Notes received Warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
The initial exercise price for the Warrants is $0.175 per share, subject to adjustment as described below, and the Warrants are
exercisable for five years after the issuance date. The Warrants are exercisable for shares of Common Stock upon the payment in
cash of the exercise price and they are also exercisable on a cashless basis at any time there is no effective registration statement
registering the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants. The exercise price of the Warrants is subject to adjustment in
the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events
affecting the Common Stock and also upon any distributions of assets, including cash, stock or other property to the Company s
stockholders. The exercise price of the Warrants is also subject to full ratchet price adjustment if the Company sells
or grants any option to purchase, sell or re-price any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (as defined therein) at an exercise
price lower than the then-current exercise price of the Warrant with the exception for certain exempted issuances and subject
to certain limitations on the reduction of the exercise price as provided in the Warrants. In the event of a fundamental transaction,
as described in the Warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Common Stock,
the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s properties or assets, the Company s
consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock, or any
person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by the outstanding Common Stock, the holders
of the Warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
that the holders would have received had they exercised the Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction; provided
that upon the occurrence of certain fundamental transactions, the holder can require the Company to purchase the Warrant for cash
at a price equal to the higher of the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of the Warrant or difference between the
cash per share paid in the fundamental transaction and the exercise price per share. The holder of Warrants will not have the
right to exercise any portion of the Warrant if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of
9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage
ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Warrants. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the form of Warrant filed as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and is incorporated by reference into this Item
1.01.  

Ancilliary
Agreements.   In connection with the Company s obligations under the Notes, the Company and its subsidiary, OncBioMune,
Inc. (the  Subsidiaries ) entered into a Security Agreement, Pledge Agreement and Subsidiary Guaranty with Calvary
Fund I LP, as agent, pursuant to which the Company and the Subsidiary granted a lien on all assets of the Company and the Subsidiary
(the  Collateral ) excluding permitted indebtedness, for the benefit of the Purchasers, to secure the Company s
obligations under the Notes. Upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes), the Purchaser may, among other things, collect
or take possession of the Collateral, proceed with the foreclosure of the security interest in the Collateral or sell, lease or
dispose of the Collateral.  

Additional
Purchaser Rights and Company Obligations    

The Securities Purchase Agreement includes additional purchaser rights and Company obligations including obligations
on the Company to reimburse the Purchasers $15,000 for legal fees and expenses, satisfy the current public information requirements
under SEC Rule 144(c), obligations on the Company with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of securities and Purchaser
rights to participate in future Company financings. Reference should be made to the full text of the Securities Purchase Agreement
filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.  

The
issuance of the Common Stock is exempt from the registration requirements from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. The Company has not engaged in general solicitation or advertising with regard to the issuance and
sale of the Note and the Warrants and has not offered securities to the public in connection with such issuance and sale.  

The
foregoing description of the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement, the Warrant, the Pledge
Agreement, and the Subsidiary Guaranty, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
provisions of such agreements, the forms of which are filed as exhibits 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K.

the Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to issue additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or
capital stock of any Subsidiary. The issuance and sale of the Securities will not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to issue
shares of Common Stock or other securities to any Person (other than the Purchasers) and will not result in a right of any holder
of Company securities to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under any of such securities. There are no outstanding

contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to redeem

with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute material, non-public information which is not otherwise

they were made, not misleading. The press releases disseminated by the Company during the twelve months preceding the date of
this Agreement do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and when made,

(aa)  Solvency .
Based on the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the receipt by the
Company of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder, (i) the fair saleable value of the Company s assets exceeds
the amount that will be required to be paid on or in respect of the Company s existing debts and other liabilities (including
known contingent liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the Company s assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to
carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted including its capital needs taking into account the particular
capital requirements of the business conducted by the Company, consolidated and projected capital requirements and capital availability
thereof, and (iii) the current cash flow of the Company, together with the proceeds the Company would receive, were it to liquidate
all of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in
respect of its liabilities when such amounts are required to be paid. The Company does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability
to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt).
The Company has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances which lead it to believe that it will file for reorganization or liquidation
under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of any jurisdiction within one year from the Closing Date. The SEC Reports set forth
as of the date hereof all outstanding secured and unsecured Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary, or for which the Company
or any Subsidiary has commitments. For the purposes of this Agreement,  Indebtedness  means (x) any liabilities for
borrowed money or amounts owed in excess of $10,000 (other than trade accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business),

are or should be reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto), except guaranties by endorsement
of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection or similar transactions in the ordinary course of business; and (z) the present
value of any lease payments in excess of $10,000 due under leases required to be capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any Indebtedness.  

(bb)  Tax
Status . Except for matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries each (i) has made or filed all United States federal, state and local
income and all foreign income and franchise tax returns, reports and declarations required by any jurisdiction to which it is
subject, (ii) has paid all taxes and other governmental assessments and charges that are material in amount, shown or determined
to be due on such returns, reports and declarations and (iii) has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for the
payment of all material taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such returns, reports or declarations apply. There
are no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and the officers of
the Company or of any Subsidiary know of no basis for any such claim.  

(cc)  Foreign
Corrupt Practices . Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor to the knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary, any agent

to the financial statements to be included in the Company s Annual Report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

based solely on the independent evaluation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company and its representatives.

liability company or similar action, as applicable, on the part of such Purchaser. Each Transaction Document to which it is a
party has been duly executed by such Purchaser, and when delivered by such Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, will
constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of such Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except:
(i) as limited by general equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
of general application affecting enforcement of creditors  rights generally, (ii) as limited by laws relating to the availability
of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and (iii) insofar as indemnification and contribution provisions

(b)  Understandings
or Arrangements . Such Purchaser is acquiring the Securities as principal for its own account and has no direct or indirect
arrangement or understandings with any other persons to distribute or regarding the distribution of such Securities (this representation
and warranty not limiting such Purchaser s right to sell the Securities in compliance with applicable federal and state
securities laws). Such Purchaser is acquiring the Securities hereunder in the ordinary course of its business. Such Purchaser
understands that the Securities are  restricted securities  and have not been registered under the Securities Act

or for distributing or reselling such Securities or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state

state securities law and has no direct or indirect arrangement or understandings with any other persons to distribute or regarding

and warranty not limiting such Purchaser s right to sell such Securities in compliance with applicable federal and state
securities laws).

of Such Purchaser . Such Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication and
experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment
in the Securities, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. Such Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk
of an investment in the Securities and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.  

(e)  Access
to Information . Such Purchaser acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to review the Transaction Documents (including
all exhibits and schedules thereto) and the SEC Reports and has been afforded, subject to Regulation FD, (i) the opportunity to

about the Company and its financial condition, results of operations, business, properties, management and prospects sufficient

made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of such Purchaser s assets, the representation set forth above shall
only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase
the Securities covered by this Agreement. Other than to other Persons party to this Agreement or to such Purchaser s representatives,
including, without limitation, its officers, directors, partners, legal and other advisors, employees, agents and Affiliates,
such Purchaser has maintained the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction (including
the existence and terms of this transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein
shall constitute a representation or warranty, or preclude any actions, with respect to the identification of the availability
of, or securing of, available shares to borrow in order to effect Short Sales or similar transactions in the future.  

The
Company acknowledges and agrees that the representations contained in this Section 3.2 shall not modify, amend or affect such
Purchaser s right to rely on the Company s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any representations
and warranties contained in any other Transaction Document or any other document or instrument executed and/or delivered in connection

ARTICLE
IV.  
OTHER AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES  

4.1  Removal
of Legends .  

(a) The
Shares, the Warrants and Warrant Shares may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In connection
with any transfer of Warrants or Warrant Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, to the
Company or to an Affiliate of a Purchaser or in connection with a pledge as contemplated in Section 4.1(b), the Company at its
sole cost may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably
acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect
that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred Restricted Warrant under the Securities Act.  

(b) The
Purchasers agree to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 4.1, of a legend on any of the Shares, the Warrants
or Warrant Shares in the following form:  

NEITHER
THIS SECURITY NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THIS SECURITY IS EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  SECURITIES ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO,
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS SECURITY AND
THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS SECURITY MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT WITH A REGISTERED
BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS AN  ACCREDITED INVESTOR  AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a)
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES.  

The
Company acknowledges and agrees that a Purchaser may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a
registered broker-dealer or grant a security interest in some or all of the Shares or Warrant Shares to a financial institution
that is an  accredited investor  as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and who agrees to be bound by
the provisions of this Agreement and, if required under the terms of such arrangement, such Purchaser may transfer pledged or
secured Shares or Warrant Shares to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer would not be subject to approval
of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel of the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection
therewith. Further, no notice shall be required of such pledge. At the appropriate Purchaser s expense, the Company will
execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Shares and Warrant Shares may reasonably request
in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Shares or Warrant Shares.  

(c) Certificates
evidencing the Shares and the Warrant Shares shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 4.1(b) hereof):
(i) while a registration statement covering the resale of such security is effective under the Securities Act, (ii) following
any sale of such Shares or Warrant Shares pursuant to Rule 144, (iii) if such Shares or Warrant Shares are eligible for sale under
Rule 144, without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule
144 as to such Shares or Warrant Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions or (iv) if such legend is not required
under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including Section 4(a)(1), judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued
by the staff of the SEC) (the  Effective Date ). The Company shall, at its expense, cause its counsel to issue a legal
opinion to the Transfer Agent promptly after the Effective Date if required by the Transfer Agent to effect the removal of the
legend hereunder. If all or any portion of a Note is converted or a Warrant is exercised at a time when there is an effective
registration statement to cover the resale of the Shares or the Warrant Shares, or if such Shares or Warrant Shares may be sold
under Rule 144 and the Company is then in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144, or if the Shares
or Warrant Shares may be sold under Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public
information required under Rule 144 as to such Shares or Warrant Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions or if
such legend is not otherwise required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including Section 4(a)(1), judicial
interpretations and pronouncements issued by the staff of the SEC) then such Shares or Warrant Shares shall be issued or reissued
free of all legends. The Company agrees that following the effective date of any registration statement or at such time as such
legend is no longer required under this Section 4.1(c), it will, no later than three Trading Days following the delivery by a
Purchaser to the Company or the Transfer Agent of a certificate representing restricted Shares or Warrant Shares, as applicable,
issued with a restrictive legend (such third Trading Day, the  Legend Removal Date ), deliver or cause to be delivered
to such Purchaser a certificate representing such Shares or Warrant Shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends.
The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to the Transfer Agent that enlarge the restrictions
on transfer set forth in this Section 4.1. Certificates for Shares or Warrant Shares subject to legend removal hereunder shall
be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Purchaser by crediting the account of the Purchaser s prime broker with the
Depository Trust Company system as directed by such Purchaser.  

(d) In
addition to such Purchaser s other available remedies, (i) the Company shall pay to a Purchaser, in cash, as partial liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of per share purchase price and exercise price, respectively, of Shares and Warrant
Shares (based on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date such Shares and/or Warrant Shares are submitted to the Transfer Agent)
delivered for removal of the restrictive legend and subject to Section 4.1(c), $10 per Trading Day for each Trading Day after
the Legend Removal Date (increasing to $20 per Trading Day after the 5th Trading Day) until such certificate is delivered without
a legend. In no event shall liquidated damages for any one transaction exceed $1,000.00 for the first ten Trading Days. Nothing
herein shall limit such Purchaser s right to pursue actual damages for the Company s failure to deliver certificates
representing any Securities as required by the Transaction Documents, and such Purchaser shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief,
and (ii) if after the Legend Removal Date such Purchaser purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Purchaser of all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock, or
a sale of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock that such Purchaser
anticipated receiving from the Company without any restrictive legend, then, the Company shall pay to such Purchaser, in cash,
an amount equal to the excess of such Purchaser s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket
expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses,
if any) (the   Buy-In Price  ) over the product of (A) such number of Shares
or Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to such Purchaser by the Legend Removal Date multiplied by (B) the
lowest closing sale price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date of the delivery by such
Purchaser to the Company of the applicable Shares or Warrant Shares (as the case may be) and ending on the date of such delivery
and payment under this Section 4.1(d).  

(e)
In the event a Purchaser shall request delivery of unlegended shares as described in this Section 4.1 and the Company is required
to deliver such unlegended shares, (i) it shall pay all fees and expenses associated with or required by the legend removal and/or
transfer including but not limited to legal fees, transfer agent fees and overnight delivery charges and taxes, if any, imposed
by any applicable government upon the issuance of Common Stock,; and (ii) the Company may not refuse to deliver unlegended shares
based on any claim that such Purchaser or anyone associated or affiliated with such Purchaser has not complied with Purchaser s
obligations under the Transaction Documents, or for any other reason, unless, an injunction or temporary restraining order from
a court, on notice, restraining and or enjoining delivery of such unlegended shares shall have been sought and obtained by the
Company and the Company has posted a surety bond for the benefit of such Purchaser in the amount of the greater of (i) 15% of
the amount of the aggregate purchase price of the Shares and Warrant Shares which is subject to the injunction or temporary restraining
order, or (ii) the VWAP of the Common Stock on the trading day before the issue date of the injunction multiplied by the number
of unlegended shares to be subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of the litigation
of the dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Purchaser to the extent Purchaser obtains judgment in Purchaser s
favor.  

4.2  Furnishing
of Information .  

(a) Until
the earliest of the time that (i) no Purchaser owns Securities or (ii) the Warrants have expired, the Company covenants to timely
file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by
the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act even if the Company is not then subject to the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act.  

(b) At
any time during the period commencing from the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof and ending at such time that all of
the Warrant Shares (assuming cashless exercise) may be sold without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with Rule
144(c)(1) and otherwise without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144, if the Company (i) shall fail for any reason to
satisfy the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c) for a period of more than 30 consecutive days or (ii) has
ever been an issuer described in Rule 144(i)(1)(i) or becomes an issuer in the future, and the Company shall fail to satisfy any
condition set forth in Rule 144(i)(2) for a period of more than 30 consecutive days (a  Public Information Failure )
then, in addition to such Purchaser s other available remedies, the Company shall pay to a Purchaser, in cash, as partial
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the Shares and/or
Warrant Shares, an amount in cash equal to two percent (2.0%) of the aggregate Note Conversion Price of such Purchaser s
Note(s) and/or Warrant Exercise Price of such Purchaser s Warrants on the day of a Public Information Failure and on every
thirtieth (30 th ) day (pro-rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) thereafter until the earlier of (a) the
date such Public Information Failure is cured and (b) such time that such public information is no longer required for the Purchasers
to transfer the Shares and/or Warrant Shares pursuant to Rule 144. In no event shall the amount paid under this section exceed
6.0% of the aggregate Note Conversion Price. The payments to which a Purchaser shall be entitled pursuant to this Section 4.2(b)
are referred to herein as  Public Information Failure Payments.  Public Information Failure Payments shall be paid
on the earlier of (i) the last day of the calendar month during which such Public Information Failure Payments are incurred and

Failure Payments shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full. Nothing herein
shall limit such Purchaser s right to pursue actual damages for the Public Information Failure, and such Purchaser shall
have the right to pursue all remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief.

in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities for purposes of the

may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any
Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i) the employment
thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time
to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material
conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such Purchaser Party, in which case the
Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel (in addition to local
counsel, if retained). The Company will not be liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a
Purchaser Party effected without the Company s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party s
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in
the other Transaction Documents. The Purchaser Parties shall have the right to settle any action against any of them by the payment
of money provided that they cannot agree to any equitable relief and the Company, its officers, directors and Affiliates receive
unconditional releases in customary form. The indemnification required by this Section 4.8 shall be made by periodic payments
of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The indemnity
agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Purchaser Party against the Company
or others and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law.  

4.9  Reservation
of Common Stock . As of the date hereof, the Company has reserved and the Company shall continue to reserve and keep available
at all times in favor of the Purchasers on a pro rata basis based on each Purchaser s Subscription Amount, free of preemptive
rights, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the greater of (i) five times the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants or (ii) 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to
adjustment for stock splits and dividends, combinations and similar events. In addition to any other remedies provided by this
Agreement or other Transaction Documents, if the Company at any time fails to meet this reservation of Common Stock requirement
 within 45 days after written notice from the Holder,  it shall pay the Purchasers as partial liquidated damages and not
as a penalty a sum equal to $500 per day for each $100,000 of each Purchaser s Subscription Amount and it shall sell to
the Lead Investor for $100 a series of preferred stock which contains the power to vote a number of votes equal to 51% of the
number of votes eligible to vote at any special or annual meeting of the Company s shareholders (with the power to take
action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting) for the sole purpose of amending the Company s Articles of
Incorporation to increase its authorized Common Stock. The Company shall not enter into any agreement or file any amendment to
its Articles of Incorporation (including the filing of a Certificate of Designation) which conflicts with this Section 4.9 while
the Notes and Warrants remain outstanding.  

4.10  Listing
of Common Stock . The Company hereby agrees to use best efforts to maintain the listing or quotation of the Common Stock on
the Trading Market on which it is currently listed, and concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall apply to list or quote
all of the Shares and Warrant Shares on such Trading Market and promptly secure the listing of all of the Shares and Warrant Shares
on such Trading Market. The Company further agrees, if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded on any other Trading
Market, it will then include in such application all of the Shares and Warrant Shares, and will take such other action as is necessary
to cause all of the Shares and Warrant Shares to be listed or quoted on such other Trading Market as promptly as possible. The
Company will then take all action necessary to continue the listing and trading of its Common Stock on a Trading Market and will
comply in all respects with the Company s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the Trading
Market. The Company agrees to maintain the eligibility of the Common Stock for electronic transfer through the Depository Trust
Company or another established clearing corporation, including, without limitation, by timely payment of fees to the Depository
Trust Company or such other established clearing corporation in connection with such electronic transfer.  

4.11  Participation
in Future Financing .  

(a) From
the date hereof until the date that is the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, upon any issuance by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents for cash consideration, Indebtedness or a combination of units hereof
in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act (a  Subsequent Financing ), each Purchaser shall
have the right to participate in up to an amount of the Subsequent Financing equal to 100% of the Subsequent Financing (the  Participation
Maximum ) on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent Financing. At least five (5) Trading Days
prior to the closing of the Subsequent Financing, the Company shall deliver to each Purchaser a written notice of its intention
to effect a Subsequent Financing ( Pre-Notice ), which Pre-Notice shall ask such Purchaser if it wants to review the
details of such financing (such additional notice, a  Subsequent Financing Notice ). Upon the request of a Purchaser,
and only upon a request by such Purchaser, for a Subsequent Financing Notice, the Company shall promptly, but no later than one
(1) Trading Day after such request, deliver a Subsequent Financing Notice to such Purchaser. The Subsequent Financing Notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Subsequent Financing, the amount of proceeds intended to be raised thereunder
and the Person or Persons through or with whom such Subsequent Financing is proposed to be effected and shall include a term sheet
or similar document relating thereto as an attachment.  

(b) Any
Purchaser desiring to participate in such Subsequent Financing must provide written notice to the Company by not later than 5:30
p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day after all of the Purchasers have received the Pre-Notice that
such Purchaser is willing to participate in the Subsequent Financing, the amount of such Purchaser s participation, and
representing and warranting that such Purchaser has such funds ready, willing, and available for investment on the terms set forth
in the Subsequent Financing Notice. If the Company receives no such notice from a Purchaser as of such fifth (5 th )
Trading Day, such Purchaser shall be deemed to have notified the Company that it does not elect to participate.  

(c) If
by 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day after all of the Purchasers have received the Pre-Notice,
notifications by the Purchasers of their willingness to participate in the Subsequent Financing (or to cause their designees to
participate) is, in the aggregate, less than the total amount of the Subsequent Financing, then the Company may effect the remaining
portion of such Subsequent Financing on the terms and with the Persons set forth in the Subsequent Financing Notice.  

(d) If
by 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day after all of the Purchasers have received the Pre-Notice,
the Company receives responses to a Subsequent Financing Notice from Purchasers seeking to purchase more than the aggregate amount
of the Participation Maximum, each such Purchaser shall have the right to purchase its Pro Rata Portion (as defined below) of
the Participation Maximum.  Pro Rata Portion  means the ratio of (x) the Subscription Amount of Securities purchased
on the Closing Date by a Purchaser participating under this Section 4.11 and (y) the sum of the aggregate Subscription Amounts
of Securities purchased on the Closing Date by all Purchasers participating under this Section 4.11.  

(e) The
Company must provide the Purchasers with a second Subsequent Financing Notice, and the Purchasers will again have the right of
participation set forth above in this Section 4.11, if the Subsequent Financing subject to the initial Subsequent Financing Notice
is not consummated for any reason on the terms set forth in such Subsequent Financing Notice within thirty (30) Trading Days after
the date of the initial Subsequent Financing Notice.  

(f) The
Company and each Purchaser agree that if any Purchaser elects to participate in the Subsequent Financing, the transaction documents
related to the Subsequent Financing shall not include any term or provision whereby such Purchaser shall be required to agree
to any restrictions on trading as to any of the Securities purchased hereunder or be required to consent to any amendment to or
termination of, or grant any waiver, release or the like under or in connection with, this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of such Purchaser.  

(g) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4.11 and unless otherwise agreed to by such Purchaser, the Company shall either confirm
in writing to such Purchaser that the transaction with respect to the Subsequent Financing has been abandoned or shall publicly
disclose its intention to issue the securities in the Subsequent Financing, in either case in such a manner such that such Purchaser
will not be in possession of any material, non-public information, by the tenth (10 th ) Business Day following delivery
of the Subsequent Financing Notice. If by such tenth (10 th ) Business Day, no public disclosure regarding a transaction
with respect to the Subsequent Financing has been made, and no notice regarding the abandonment of such transaction has been received
by such Purchaser, such transaction shall be deemed to have been abandoned and such Purchaser shall not be deemed to be in possession
of any material, non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  

(h) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 4.11 shall not apply in respect of (i) an Exempt Issuance, (ii) a public offering registered with
the SEC, or (iii) with respect to any Purchaser other than the Prior Investor, any offering of securities described in clause
(e) of the Exempt Issuance definition.  

(i) .  

4.12  Subsequent
Equity Sales.   

(a) From
the date hereof until 30 days after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall issue, enter into any agreement
to issue or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents.  

(b) From
the date hereof until the earlier of (i) date that is the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) such time as the Notes
have been paid in full, the Company will not, without the consent of the Purchasers, enter into any Equity Line of Credit or similar
agreement, nor issue nor agree to issue any common stock, floating or Variable Priced Equity Linked Instruments nor any of the
foregoing or equity with price reset rights (subject to adjustment for stock splits, distributions, dividends, recapitalizations
and the like) (collectively, the  Variable Rate Transaction ). For purposes hereof,  Equity Line of Credit 
shall include any transaction involving a written agreement between the Company and an investor or underwriter whereby the Company
has the right to  put  its securities to the investor or underwriter over an agreed period of time and at an agreed
price or price formula, and  Variable Priced Equity Linked Instruments  shall include: (A) any debt or equity securities
which are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, or carry the right to receive additional shares of Common Stock either
(1) at any conversion, exercise or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or
quotations for Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security, or (2) with a fixed conversion,
exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date at any time after the initial issuance of such debt
or equity security due to a change in the market price of the Company s Common Stock since date of initial issuance, and
(B) any amortizing convertible security which amortizes prior to its maturity date, where the Company is required or has the option
to (or any investor in such transaction has the option to require the Company to) make such amortization payments in shares of
Common Stock which are valued at a price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for Common
Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security (whether or not such payments in stock are subject
to certain equity conditions). For purposes of determining the total consideration for a convertible instrument (including a right
to purchase equity of the Company) issued, subject to an original issue or similar discount or which principal amount is directly
or indirectly increased after issuance, the consideration will be deemed to be the actual cash amount received by the Company
in consideration of the original issuance of such convertible instrument. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be prohibited from engaging in any Variable Rate Transaction in connection with any offering of securities described in clause
(e) of the Exempt Issuance definition.  

(c) From
the date hereof until the earlier of (i) date that is the eighteenth month anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) such time as
no Purchaser holds any Securities, in the event that the Company issues or sells any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents,
if a Purchaser then holding Securities purchased under this Agreement reasonably believes that any of the terms and conditions
appurtenant to such issuance or sale are more favorable to such investors than are the terms and conditions granted to the Purchasers
hereunder, upon notice to the Company by such Purchaser within five Trading Days after disclosure of such issuance or sale, the
Company shall amend the terms of this transaction as to such Purchaser only so as to give such Purchaser the benefit of such more
favorable terms or conditions.  

(d) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 4.12 shall not apply in respect of an Exempt Issuance and shall only apply as to price terms in respect
of any rights offering. The Company shall provide each Purchaser with notice of any such issuance or sale in the manner for disclosure
of Subsequent Financings set forth in Section 4.11.  

4.13  Equal
Treatment of Purchasers . No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document) shall be offered or paid
to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration
is also offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents. For clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate
right granted to each Purchaser by the Company and negotiated separately by each Purchaser, and is intended for the Company to
treat the Purchasers as a class and shall not in any way be construed as the Purchasers acting in concert or as a group with respect
to the purchase, disposition or voting of Securities or otherwise.  

4.14  Certain
Transactions and Confidentiality . Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that neither
it nor any Affiliate acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it will execute any purchases or sales, including
Short Sales of any of the Company s securities during the period commencing with the execution of this Agreement and ending
at such time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release
as described in Section 4.4. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that until such time
as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are publicly disclosed by the Company pursuant to the initial press release
as described in Section 4.4, such Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of the existence and terms of this transaction and
the information included in the Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) no Purchaser makes any representation,
warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage in effecting transactions in any securities of the Company after the time
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as described
in Section 4.4, (ii) no Purchaser shall be restricted or prohibited from effecting any transactions in any securities of the Company
in accordance with applicable securities laws from and after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.4 and (iii) no Purchaser shall have any
duty of confidentiality or duty not to trade in the securities of the Company to the Company or its Subsidiaries after the issuance
of the initial press release as described in Section 4.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a
multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchaser s assets
and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other
portions of such Purchaser s assets, the covenant set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets
managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.  

4.15  Capital
Changes . Until the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company shall not undertake a reverse or forward stock split
or reclassification of the Common Stock without the prior written consent of the Purchasers holding a majority in interest of
the outstanding principal balance of the Notes.  

4.16  Conversion
and Exercise Procedures . The forms of Conversion Notice and Notice of Exercise included in the Notes and Warrants set forth
the totality of the procedures required of the Purchasers in order to exercise the Warrants. No additional legal opinion, other
information or instructions shall be required of the Purchasers to convert their Notes or exercise their Warrants. Without limiting
the preceding sentences, no ink-original Conversion Notice or Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee
(or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Conversion Notice or Notice of Exercise form be required in order to convert
the Notes or exercise the Warrants. The Company shall honor conversions of the Notes and exercises of the Warrants and shall deliver
Shares and Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms, conditions and time periods set forth in the Transaction Documents.  

4.17  DTC
Program . After the Public Company Date, and for so long as any Warrants are outstanding, the Company will employ as the transfer
agent for the Common Stock and Warrant Shares a participant in the Depository Trust Company Automated Securities Transfer Program
and cause the Common Stock to be transferable pursuant to such program.  

4.18  Maintenance
of Property . The Company shall keep all of its property, which is necessary or useful to the conduct of its business, in good
working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.  

4.19
 Preservation of Corporate Existence . The Company shall preserve and maintain its corporate existence, rights, privileges
and franchises in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and qualify and remain qualified, as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is necessary in view of its business or operations and where the failure to qualify or remain qualified
might reasonably have a Material Adverse Effect upon the financial condition, business or operations of the Company taken as a
whole.  

4.20  No
Registration of Securities .  While the Notes are outstanding, the Company will not file any registration statements, on
Form S-8 or otherwise, to register sales of Common Stock, including shares underlying any derivative securities.

they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be

5.14  Rescission
and Withdrawal Right . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of)
any of the other Transaction Documents, whenever any Purchaser exercises a right, election, demand or option under a Transaction
Document and the Company does not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided, then such Purchaser
may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the Company, any relevant notice, demand
or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights;  provided ,  however , that in the
case of a rescission of an exercise of a Warrant, the applicable Purchaser shall be required to return any shares of Common Stock
subject to any such rescinded exercise notice concurrently with the return to such Purchaser of the aggregate exercise price paid
to the Company for such shares and the restoration of such Purchaser s right to acquire such shares pursuant to such Purchaser s
Warrant (including, issuance of a replacement warrant certificate evidencing such restored right).  

5.15  Replacement

to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction without requiring the posting of any bond.  

5.16  Remedies .
In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of
the Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that
monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations contained in the
Transaction Documents and hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any Action for specific performance of any such obligation
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.  

5.17  Payment
Set Aside . To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document
or a Purchaser enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or
exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from,
disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other Person
under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action),
then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived
and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.  

5.18  Independent
Nature of Purchasers  Obligations and Rights . The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several
and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance
or non-performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any
other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto including any action taken by the
Collateral Agent as defined by the Security Agreement (whether under this Agreement or the Security Agreement), shall be deemed
to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption
that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights including, without

by its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. The Company has elected to provide
all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required
or requested to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement

collectively and not between and among the Purchasers.

Business Day.  

5.21  Construction .
The parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel have reviewed and had an opportunity to revise the Transaction
Documents and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting
party shall not be employed in the interpretation of the Transaction Documents or any amendments thereto. In addition, each and
every reference to share prices and shares of Common Stock in any Transaction Document shall be subject to adjustment for reverse
and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the Common Stock that occur after
the date of this Agreement.

AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES FOREVER TRIAL BY JURY.    

5.23  Non-Circumvention .
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, including any
Certificates of Designation, or Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms of this Agreement, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provision of this Agreement and
take all action as may be required to protect the rights of all holders of the Securities. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase
the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion of the Note or exercise of the Warrants above the Note
Conversion Price, or Warrant Exercise Price, as applicable, then in effect and (b) shall take all such action as may be necessary
or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and noassessable Shares upon the conversion
of the Note and Warrant Shares upon exercise of the Warrants. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if after 180 days
from the original issuance date, a holder is not permitted to convert the Note or exercise the Warrants, in full, for any reason,
the Company shall use its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consent
or approvals as necessary to permit such conversion or exercise.

Promissory Note in the original principal amount of $40,000 issued to Crown Bridge Partners, LLC on May 23, 2016. This note will
be paid-off at Closing.  

2. Purchase
Agreement dated as of October 20, 2015 by and between OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (See
Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2015).  

3. Registration
Rights Agreement dated as of October 20, 2015, by and between the Company and Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (See Exhibit 10.2
to the Company s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2015).  

4. May
23, 2016 convertible promissory note (the  Convertible Note ) issued to Crown Bridge Partners, LLC (the  Lender ).
The Lender is entitled, at their option, at any time after the issuance of the Convertible Note, to convert all or any lesser
portion of the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest into the Company s common stock. The Conversion
Price is the Variable Conversion Price ( VCP ) as defined in the Convertible Note and subject, in each case, to equitable
adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company s securities or
the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions
and similar events. VCP means 58% multiplied by the  Market Price , which is calculated as the lowest trading price,
as defined, for the Company s common stock during the twenty trading day period ending on the last complete trading day
prior to the conversion date. If at any time while the Convertible Note is outstanding, the lowest trading prices for the Company s
common stock is equal to or lower than $0.10, then an additional discount of five percent (5%) will be factored into the VCP until
the Convertible Note is no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 47% assuming no other adjustments are triggered
hereunder). In the event that shares of the Company s common stock are not deliverable via DWAC following the conversion
of any amount thereunder, an additional five percent (5%) discount shall be factored into the VCP until the Convertible Note is
no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 47% assuming no other adjustments are triggered hereunder).

6. November
2, 2016 non-binding term sheet to acquire Vitel Laboratorios S.A. de C.V. ( Vitel ). Pursuant to the term sheet, our
planned acquisition of Vitel will be structured as an all-stock transaction with both the Company and Vitel contributing equity
interests into a newly created trust, resulting in Vitel operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

                                         Stock as reported on the OTCQB or other principal Trading Market on which the Company s
                                         shares are traded for the ten (10) prior Trading Days prior to the applicable Payment
                                         Date.    

(e)  Prepayment .
The Notes may be prepaid at any time until the 180th day following the Original Issue Date at an amount equal to (i) 115% of outstanding
principal balance of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest during the period from the Original Issue Date through the three
months following the Original Issue Date, and (ii) 120% of outstanding principal balance of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest
during months four through six following the Original Issue Date. In order to prepay the Notes, the Company shall provide 20 Trading
Days prior written notice to the Holder, during which time the Holder may convert the Notes in whole or in part at the Conversion
Price. Payments under Section 2(c) shall not be deemed a prepayment for purposes of this Section 2(e).  

Section
3 .  Registration of Transfers and Exchanges .  

(a)  Different
Denominations . This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations,
as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be payable for such registration of transfer or exchange.  

(b)  Investor
Representations . This Note has been issued subject to certain investment representations of the original Holder set forth
in the Purchase Agreement and may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Purchase Agreement and applicable federal
and state securities laws and regulations.  

(c)  Reliance
on Note Register . Prior to due presentment for transfer to the Company of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company
may treat the Person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Note Register as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving
payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company nor any such
agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.  

Section
4.   Conversion.   

(a)  Voluntary
Conversion . After the Original Issue Date until this Note is no longer outstanding, and provided that that the provisions
of Rule 144 under the Securities Act so permit, this Note shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time
to time, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder. The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the Company
a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as  Annex A  (each, a  Notice of Conversion ), specifying
therein the principal amount of this Note to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall be effected (such date,
the  Conversion Date ). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be
the date that such Notice of Conversion is deemed delivered hereunder. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required,
nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required. To
effect conversions hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless the entire
principal amount of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, has been so converted. Conversions hereunder shall
have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Note in an amount equal to the applicable conversion. The
Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount(s) converted in each conversion, the date of each conversion,
and the Conversion Price in effect at the time of each conversion. The Company may deliver an objection to any Notice of Conversion
within one Business Day of delivery of such Notice of Conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the
Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error.  The Holder, and any assignee by acceptance
of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of
this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.   

(b)  Conversion
Price . The  Conversion Price  in effect on any Conversion Date means, as of any Conversion Date or other date
of determination, fifteen cents ($0.15) per share (subject to adjustment as provided herein),  provided, however , that if
an Event of Default has occurred, regardless of whether such Event of Default has been cured or remains ongoing, the Note shall
be convertible at 60% of the lowest closing price during the prior twenty (20) Trading Days of the Common Stock as reported on
the OTCQB or other principal Trading Market (the  Default Conversion Price ).  

(c)  Mechanics
of Conversion or Prepayment .  

(i)  Conversion
Shares Issuable Upon Conversion of Principal Amount . The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion hereunder
shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the outstanding principal amount of this Note to be converted by
(y) the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such conversion.  

(ii)  Delivery
of Certificate Upon Conversion . Not later than three (3) Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the  Share Delivery
Date ), the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder any certificate or certificates required to be
delivered by the Company under this Section 4(c) which, on or after the six month anniversary of the Original Issue Date, shall
be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those which may then be required by the Purchase Agreement)
and such shares shall be delivered electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation
performing similar functions.  

(iii)  Failure
to Deliver Certificates . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such certificate or certificates are not delivered to
or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to
the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates, to rescind such Conversion, in which event
the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Note delivered to the Company and the Holder shall promptly return
to the Company the Common Stock certificates issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Conversion Notice.  

(iv)  Obligation
Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Company s obligations to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion
of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the
Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any
Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or
alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law
by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the
Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares;  provided ,  however , that such delivery
shall not operate as a waiver by the Company of any such action the Company may have against the Holder. In the event the Holder
of this Note shall elect to convert any or all of the outstanding principal amount hereof, the Company may not refuse conversion
based on any claim that the Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder has been engaged in any violation of law,
agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and or enjoining conversion
or prepayment of all or part of this Note shall have been sought and obtained, and the Company posts a surety bond for the benefit
of the Holder in the amount of 150% of the outstanding principal amount of this Note, which is subject to the injunction, which
bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which
shall be payable to the Holder to the extent it obtains judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Company shall issue Conversion
Shares upon a properly noticed conversion. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates
pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) by the Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and
not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of principal amount being converted, $10 per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day
on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day after such Conversion Date) for each Trading Day after such Share Delivery Date until
such certificates are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. In no event shall liquidated damages for any one conversion
exceed $1,000.00 for the first ten Trading Days. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages or
declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 7 hereof for the Company s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the
period specified herein and the Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity
including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall
not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.  

(v)  Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by the Share Delivery Date pursuant
to Section 4(c)(ii), and if after such Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open
market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion
relating to such Share Delivery Date (a  Buy-In ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase
price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale
price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of
the attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares
of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(c)(ii).
For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an
attempted conversion of this Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage
commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence,
the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts
payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing
herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including,
without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely
deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof.  

(vi)  Reservation
of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Company covenants that it will reserve and keep available out of its authorized and
unissued shares of Common Stock for the purpose of issuances upon conversion of this Note (and other purposes further detailed
in the Purchase Agreement), free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the
Holder (and the other holders of the Notes), not less than the amount of shares designated in Section 4.9 of the Purchase Agreement.
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  

(vii)  Fractional
Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. As
to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall at
its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by
the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share.  

(viii)  Transfer
Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of certificates for shares of the Common Stock on conversion of this Note shall be made without
charge to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery
of such certificates, provided that, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of this
Note so converted and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the Person or Persons
requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of
any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing
similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares.  

(d)   Holder s
Conversion Limitations . The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and a Holder shall not have the right to
convert any portion of this Note, to the extent that after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice
of Conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with the Holder
or any of the Holder s Affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates
shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which such determination
is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining,
unconverted principal amount of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, any other Notes or the Warrants) beneficially owned
by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 4(d), beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 4(d) applies, the determination of whether this Note is convertible
(in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which principal amount of this Note
is convertible shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to
be the Holder s determination of whether this Note may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder
together with any Affiliates) and which principal amount of this Note is convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, the Holder will be deemed to represent to the Company each time it delivers
a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company
shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group
status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 4(d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Company s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the SEC, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Company,
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Company s transfer agent setting forth the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally
and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including
this Note, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.
The  Beneficial Ownership Limitation  shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note held by the Holder. The Holder,
upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company, may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of
this Section 4(d) solely with respect to the Holder s Note, provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event
exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of
Common Stock upon conversion of this Note held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 4(d) shall continue to apply.
Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The Holder
may also decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(d) solely with respect to the Holder s
Note at any time, which decrease shall be effectively immediately upon delivery of notice to the Company. The Beneficial Ownership
Limitation provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with
the terms of this Section 4(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the
intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Note.  

Section
5 .  Certain Adjustments .  

(a)  Stock
Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents
(which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon conversion of, or payment
of interest on, the Notes or pursuant to any of the other Transaction Documents), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares
of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and
of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment
made pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination or re-classification.  

(b)  Subsequent
Equity Sales . If, at any time, for so long as the Note or any amounts accrued and payable thereunder remain outstanding, the
Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, sells or grants any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise
disposes of or issues (or announces any sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition), any Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the
Conversion Price then in effect (such lower price, the  Base Conversion Price  and each such issuance or announcement
a  Dilutive Issuance ), then the Conversion Price shall be immediately reduced to equal the Base Conversion Price.
Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued.  

If
the price per share for which shares of Common Stock are sold, or may be issuable pursuant to any such Common Stock Equivalent,
is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, or if, after any such issuance of Common Stock Equivalents, the price per share
for which shares of Common Stock may be issuable thereafter is amended or adjusted, and such price as so amended shall be less
than the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such amendment or adjustment, then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted upon
each such issuance or amendment as provided in this Section 5(b). In case any Common Stock Equivalent is issued in connection
with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction, (x) the Common Stock
Equivalents will be deemed to have been issued for the Option Value of such Common Stock Equivalents and (y) the other securities
issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed to have been issued or sold for the difference of (I) the aggregate
consideration received by the Company less any consideration paid or payable by the Company pursuant to the terms of such other
securities of the Company, less (II) the Option Value. If any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued or
sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be deemed to
be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued or sold
for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration,
except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by
the Company will be the VWAP of such public traded securities on the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the
surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and
business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, as the case
may be.  

If
the holder of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents outstanding on the Original Issue Date or issued thereafter shall at any
time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or
otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive
shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price then in effect, such issuance shall
be deemed to have occurred for less than the Conversion Price on such date and such issuance shall be deemed to be a Dilutive
Issuance.  

If
the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction despite the prohibition set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall
be deemed to have issued Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at the lowest possible conversion price at which such securities
may be converted or exercised under the terms of such Variable Rate Transaction.  

The
Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 5(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange
price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the  Dilutive Issuance Notice ). For purposes of clarification,
whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive
Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Conversion Shares based upon the Base Conversion Price on or after the
date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Conversion Price in the Notice
of Conversion.  

The
provisions of this Section 5(b) shall apply each time a Dilutive Issuance occurs after the Original Issue Date for so long as
the Note or any amounts accrued and payable thereunder remain outstanding, but any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant
to this Section 5(b) shall be downward only. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made under this Section 5(b)
in respect of an Exempt Issuance.  

(c)  Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 5(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues
or sells any Common Stock, Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the  Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired
if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to
any limitations on conversion hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the
date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights
( provided ,  however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would
result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such
Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such
extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right
thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).  

(d)  Pro
Rata Distributions . During such time as this Note is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other
distribution of its assets or rights or warrants to acquire its assets, or subscribe for or purchase any security other than Common
Stock, to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution
of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement,
scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a  Distribution ), at any time after the issuance of this Note,
then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would
have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this
Note (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation)
immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution ( provided ,
 however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder
exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation with respect to the Company or any other publicly-traded corporation subject to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or
in the beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of
such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would
not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation with respect to the Company or any other publicly-traded
corporation subject to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).  

(e)  Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Note is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets
in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making
or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or
other business combination) (each a  Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Note,
the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately
prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the conversion of this Note), the
number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation,
and any additional consideration (the  Alternate Consideration ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction
by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Note is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction
(without regard to any limitation on the conversion of this Note). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the
Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration
issuable in respect of one (1) share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Conversion
Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the
Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received
in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon
any conversion of this Note following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of
a Fundamental Transaction that is (1) an all cash transaction, (2) a  Rule 13e-3 transaction  as defined in Rule 13e-3
under the Exchange Act, or (3) a Fundamental Transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange
or trading market (with such exchange or market including, without limitation, the Nasdaq Global Select Trading Market, the Nasdaq
Global Market, or the Nasdaq Capital Market, The New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the NYSE MKT or the OTCQB), the Company or any
Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder s option, exercisable concurrently with the consummation of the
Fundamental Transaction, purchase this Note from the Holder by paying to the Holder the higher of (i) an amount of cash equal
to the Black Scholes Value of the outstanding principal of this Note on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction,
or (ii) the product of (a) the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon full conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitation
on conversion of this Note) and (b) the positive difference between the cash per share paid in such Fundamental Transaction minus
the then in effect Conversion Price. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company
is not the survivor (the  Successor Entity ) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this
Note and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) in accordance with the provisions of this Section
5(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without
unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Note, deliver to the
Holder in exchange for this Note a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in
form and substance to this Note which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity
(or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Note (without
regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Note) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which
applies the Conversion Price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares
of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares
of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Note immediately prior
to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that
from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Note and the other Transaction Documents referring
to the  Company  shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company
and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect
as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5(d), an Exempt Issuance
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) shall not be deemed a Fundamental Transaction.  

(f)  Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding.  

(g)  Notice
to the Holder .  

(i)  Adjustment
to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 5, the Company shall
promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement
of the facts requiring such adjustment.  

(ii)  Notice
to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on
the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C)
the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required
in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any
sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common
Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed at each office
or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Note, and shall cause to be delivered to the Holder at its last address
as it shall appear upon the Note Register, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption,
rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled
to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it
is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities,
cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided
that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the
corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains,
material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Company),
the Company or its successor shall simultaneously file such notice with the SEC pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The
Holder shall remain entitled to convert this Note during the 20-day period commencing on the date of such notice through the effective
date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.  

Section
6 .  Negative Covenants . As long as any portion of this Note remains outstanding, unless the holders of 100% in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes shall have otherwise given prior written consent, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of the Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

required for board approval);

respective Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents) shall only be commenced in the state and federal
courts sitting in New York, New York (the  New York Courts ). Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with
any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents),
and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally

waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Note. The failure of the Company

other occasion. Any waiver by the Company or the Holder must be in writing.  

(g)  Severability .
If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any
provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances.
If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury,
the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under
applicable law. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead,
or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law which would
prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on this Note as contemplated herein,
wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Note, and
the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits or advantage of any such law, and covenants
that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Holder,
but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been enacted.

right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Note. The Company
covenants to the Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein.
Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall
be the amounts to be received by the Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation
of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause
irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach would be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees
that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies,
to an injunction restraining any such breach or any such threatened breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and
without any bond or other security being required. The Company shall provide all information and documentation to the Holder that
is requested by the Holder to enable the Holder to confirm the Company s compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Note.

COMMON
STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT   

   OncBioMune
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   

THIS
COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT (the  Warrant ) certifies that, for value received, [__], or its assigns (the  Holder )
is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter set forth, at any time on
or after the date hereof (the  Initial Exercise Date ) and on or prior to the close of business on the five (5) year
anniversary of the Initial Exercise Date (the  Termination Date ) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase
from OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ), up to [__] shares of Common Stock (subject
to adjustment hereunder, the  Warrant Shares ). The purchase price of one Warrant Share under this Warrant shall be
equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b).  

Section
1 .  Definitions . Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that
certain Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), dated November 18, 2016, among the Company and the
Purchasers.  

Section
2 .  Exercise .  

(a) Exercise
of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after the Initial
Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company
as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the books of the Company)
of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto. Within two (2) Trading Days following the date
of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the shares specified in the applicable Notice
of Exercise by wire transfer or cashier s check drawn on a United States bank unless the cashless exercise procedure specified
in Section 2(c) below is specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (although
the Holder may surrender the Warrant to, and receive a replacement Warrant from, the Company), the Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder
and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation
within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this
Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of
lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant
Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date
of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise Form within one (1) Trading Day of delivery
of such notice. The Holder by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledges and agrees that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph,
following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder
at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

(b)  Exercise
Price . The initial exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be equal to $0.175 per share, subject
to adjustment under Section 3 (the  Exercise Price ).  

(c)  Cashless
Exercise . If at any time after the Initial Exercise Date, there is no effective Registration Statement covering the resale
of the Warrant Shares by the Holder, then this Warrant may also be exercised at the Holder s election, in whole or in part
and in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise, at such time by means
of a  cashless exercise  in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing [(A x B)   (A x C)] by (D), where:  

(A)  
      =
    the number of Warrant Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant
    if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise;   

(B)  
      =
    the greater of (i) the arithmetic average of the VWAPs for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days ending on the date immediately
    preceding the date on which the Holder elects to exercise this Warrant by means of a  cashless exercise,  as set
    forth in the applicable Notice of Exercise or (ii) the VWAP for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which the
    Holder makes such  cashless exercise  election;   

(C)
    =   
      the
    Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder, at the time of such exercise; and   

(D)
= the lesser of (i) the arithmetic average of the VWAPs for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days ending on the date immediately
preceding the date on which the Holder elects to exercise this Warrant by means of a  cashless exercise,  as set forth
in the applicable Notice of Exercise or (ii) the VWAP for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which the Holder makes
such  cashless exercise  election.  

VWAP 
means, for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a) if the Common Stock is then
listed or quoted on a Trading Market, the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest
preceding date) on the Trading Market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted as reported by Bloomberg L.P. (based
on a Trading Day from 9:30 a.m. (New York City time) to 4:02 p.m. (New York City time)), (b) if OTCQB or OTCQX is not a Trading
Market, the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on OTCQB or OTCQX
as applicable, (c) if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted for trading on OTCQB or OTCQX and if prices for the Common
Stock are then reported in the  Pink Sheets  published by OTC Markets, Inc. (or a similar organization or agency succeeding
to its functions of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported, or (d) in all other
cases, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an independent appraiser selected in good faith by the
Holders of a majority in interest of the Securities then outstanding and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the fees and expenses
of which shall be paid by the Company.  

If
Warrant Shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the parties acknowledge and agree that in accordance with Section 3(a)(9)
of the Securities Act, the Warrant Shares shall take on the characteristics of the Warrants being exercised, and the holding period
of the Warrants being exercised may be tacked on to the holding period of the Warrant Shares. The Company agrees not to take any
position contrary to this Section 2(c).  

Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if on the Termination Date (unless the Holder notifies the Company otherwise) if there is no
effective Registration Statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder, then this Warrant shall be automatically
exercised via cashless exercise pursuant to this Section 2(c).  

(d)  Mechanics
of Exercise .  

(i)  Delivery
of Certificates Upon Exercise . Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted to the Holder by the Transfer
Agent to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s prime broker with The Depository Trust Company through its
Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system ( DWAC ) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either
(A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares
by the Holder or (B) this Warrant is being exercised via cashless exercise and Rule 144 is available, and otherwise by physical
delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is three (3) Trading Days after the
latest of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise and (B) payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as set forth
above (unless by cashless exercise, if permitted) (such date, the  Warrant Share Delivery Date ). The Warrant Shares
shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have
become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment to the
Company of the Exercise Price (or by cashless exercise, if permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any,
pursuant to Section 2(d)(vi) prior to the issuance of such shares, having been paid. The Company understands that a delay in the
delivery of the Warrant Shares after the Warrant Share Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder. As compensation
to the Holder for such loss, the Company agrees to pay (as liquidated damages and not as a penalty) to the Holder for late issuance
of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant the proportionate amount of $10 per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading
Day after the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day) after the Warrant Share Delivery Date for each $1,000 of Exercise Price of Warrant
Shares for which this Warrant is exercised which are not timely delivered. In no event shall liquidated damages for any one transaction
exceed $1,000.00 for the first ten Trading Days. The Company shall pay any payments incurred under this Section 2(d)(i) in immediately
available funds upon demand. Furthermore, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Holder, in the event
that the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the Warrant Shares by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Holder
may revoke all or part of the relevant Warrant exercise by delivery of a notice to such effect to the Company, whereupon the Company
and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to the exercise of the relevant portion
of this Warrant, except that the liquidated damages described above shall be payable through the date notice of revocation or
rescission is given to the Company.  

(ii)  Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant
Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called
for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical to this Warrant.  

(iii)  Rescission
Rights . If the Company fails to deliver the Warrant Shares cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate
or the certificates representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder
will have the right, at any time prior to issuance of such Warrant Shares, to rescind such exercise.  

(iv)  Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails to deliver the Warrant Shares, or cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the
certificates representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after
such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder s
brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares
which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a  Buy-In ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to
the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any)
for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that
the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell
order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion
of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall
be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company
timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having
a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate
sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company
shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable
to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall
limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates
representing shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.  

(v)  No
Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the
Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.  

(vi)  Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or
transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate including any charges of any clearing
firm, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder
or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder;  provided ,  however , that in the event certificates for
Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall
be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition
thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all Transfer
Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise.  

(vii)  Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of
this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.  

(e)  Holder s
Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and
any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates), would beneficially own
in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned
by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion
or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as
set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder
that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities
owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion
of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion
of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation
to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by
the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request
of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect
to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the
date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The  Beneficial Ownership Limitation 
shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company,
may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e) solely with respect to the Holder s Warrant,
provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and
the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase will not be effective until the 61 st 
day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The Holder may also decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions
of this Section 2(e) solely with respect to the Holder s Warrant at any time, which decrease shall be effectively immediately
upon delivery of notice to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise
than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective
or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary
or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor
holder of this Warrant.  

Section
3 .  Certain Adjustments .  

(a)  Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant or pursuant to any of the other Transaction Documents), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock
of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain
unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the
effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.  

(b)  Adjustments
for Issuance of Additional Securities.  For a period of two (2) years from the Initial Exercise Date, in the event that the
Company shall, at any time, issue or sell any additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (hereafter defined)
( Additional Shares of Common Stock ), in a transaction other than an Exempt Issuance, at a price per share less than
the Exercise Price then in effect or without consideration (a  Dilutive Issuance  based on a  Dilutive Issuance
Price ), then the Exercise Price upon each such issuance shall be reduced to the Dilutive Issuance Price, and the number
of Warrant Shares (excluding Warrant Shares previously exercised) shall be increased on a full ratchet basis to the number of
shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying the Exercise Price then in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the
number of Warrant Shares (excluding Warrant Shares previously exercised) acquirable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately
prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. By way of example,
if E is the total number of Warrant Shares in effect immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance, F is the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to such Dilutive Issuance, and G is the Dilutive Issuance Price, the adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares
can be expressed in the following formula: Total number of Warrant Shares after such Dilutive Issuance = the quotient obtained
from dividing [E x F] by G.  

If
the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common Stock are sold, or may be issuable pursuant to any such Common Stock
Equivalent, is less than the applicable Exercise Price then in effect, or if, after any such issuance of Common Stock Equivalents,
the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common Stock may be issuable thereafter is amended or adjusted, and such price
as so amended shall be less than the applicable Exercise Price in effect at the time of such amendment or adjustment, then the
applicable Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares shall be adjusted upon each such issuance or amendment as provided in this
Section 3(b). In case any Common Stock Equivalent is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company,
together comprising one integrated transaction, (x) the Common Stock Equivalents will be deemed to have been issued for the Option
Value of such Common Stock Equivalents and (y) the other securities issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed
to have been issued or sold for the difference of (I) the aggregate consideration received by the Company less any consideration
paid or payable by the Company pursuant to the terms of such other securities of the Company, less (II) the Option Value. If any
shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the amount
of such consideration received by the Company will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any shares
of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration
received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded
securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the VWAP of such public traded securities
on the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued to the owners of the non-surviving
entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be
deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such
shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, as the case may be.  

Common
Stock Equivalents  means any rights or warrants or options to purchase any Common Stock or Convertible Securities.  

Option
Value  means the value of a Common Stock Equivalent based on the Black Scholes Option Pricing model obtained from the  OV 
function on Bloomberg L.P. determined as of (A) the Trading Day prior to the public announcement of the issuance of the applicable
Common Stock Equivalent, if the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent is publicly announced or (B) the Trading Day immediately
following the issuance of the applicable Common Stock Equivalent if the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent is not publicly
announced, for pricing purposes and reflecting (i) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period
equal to the remaining term of the applicable Common Stock Equivalent as of the applicable date of determination, (ii) an expected
volatility equal to the greater of 100% and the 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg L.P. as of (A)
the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Common Stock Equivalent if the issuance of such
Common Stock Equivalent is publicly announced or (B) the Trading Day immediately following the issuance of the applicable Common
Stock Equivalent if the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent is not publicly announced, (iii) the underlying price per share
used in such calculation shall be the highest VWAP of the Common Stock during the period beginning on the Trading Day prior to
the execution of definitive documentation relating to the issuance of the applicable Common Stock Equivalent and ending on (A)
the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of such issuance, if the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent
is publicly announced or (B) the Trading Day immediately following the issuance of the applicable Common Stock Equivalent if the
issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent is not publicly announced, (iv) a zero cost of borrow and (v) a 360 day annualization
factor.  

The
provisions of this Section 3(b) shall apply each time the Company, at any time after the Original Issuance Date and prior to the
date that is two (2) years from Original Issuance Date, shall issue any securities with a Dilutive Issuance Price. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 3(b) with respect to an Exempt Issuance (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement).  

(c)  Adjustment
upon Event of Default . At any time from the Initial Exercise Date until the Termination Date that, due to the occurrence of
an Event of Default (as defined in the Note), the Default Conversion Price (as defined in the Notes) is in effect, the Exercise
Price of this Warrant shall be reduced to the Default Conversion Price. The Company shall give the Holder prompt written notice
of the occurrence of an Event of Default.  

(d)  Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues
or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the  Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder
had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a
record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided,
however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent
(or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the
Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Purchase Rights will be made under this
Section 3(d) in respect of an Exempt Issuance.  

(e)  Pro
Rata Distributions . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common
Stock (and not to the Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the Common Stock (which shall be subject to Section 3(c)), then in each such
case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP
determined as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then
per share fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable
to one outstanding share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the adjustments
shall be described in a statement provided to the Holder of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed
or such subscription rights applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution
is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above.  

(f)  Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets
in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person
or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share
purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a  Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent exercise
of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the exercise of this
Warrant), at the option of the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the
Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the  Alternate Consideration ) receivable
as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable
immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes
of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration
based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the
Holder s option, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental
Transaction, purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the Holder an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value
of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction or (ii) the
positive difference between the cash per share paid in such Fundamental Transaction minus the then in effect Exercise Price.  Black
Scholes Value  means the value of the unexercised portion of this Warrant based on the Black and Scholes Option Pricing
Model obtained from the  OV  function on Bloomberg L.P. determined as of the day of consummation of the applicable
Fundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate
for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and the Termination
Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to the greater of 100% and the 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg
L.P. as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (C) the underlying
price per share used in such calculation shall be the sum of the price per share being offered in cash, if any, plus the value
of any non-cash consideration, if any, being offered in such Fundamental Transaction and (D) a remaining option time equal to
the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date. The Company
shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the  Successor Entity )
to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 3(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder
and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the
Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument
substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital
stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon
exercise of this Warrant prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the exercise of this Warrant),
and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account
the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital
stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of
this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and
be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other
Transaction Documents referring to the  Company  shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every
right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction
Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 3(f) with respect to an Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)  

(g)  Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.  

(h)  Notice
to Holder .  

(i)  Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall
promptly email to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the
number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Holder may supply an
email address to the Company and change such address.  

(ii)  Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer

Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant substantially

in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so

by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued.  

(b)  New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of
the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed
by the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such

Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the  Warrant
Register ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder
of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and for
all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.  

Section
5 .  Miscellaneous .  

(a)  No
Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights
as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof other than as explicitly set forth in Section 3.  

(b)  Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon surrender
and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock
certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.  

(c)  Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Trading Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Trading Day.  

(d)  Authorized
Shares .  

The
Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common
Stock, free of preemptive rights five times the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, subject
to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, combination and similar events. The Company further covenants that its issuance
of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates
to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided
herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of any Trading Market upon which the Common
Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights
represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant
Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens
and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously
with such issue).  

In
addition to any other remedies provided by this Warrant or the Purchase Agreement, if the Company at any time fails to meet this
reservation of Common Stock requirement within 45 days after written notice from the Holder, it shall pay the Holder as partial
liquidated damages and not as a penalty a sum equal to $500 per day for each $100,000 of such Holder s Subscription Amount
(or the Subscription Amount of the original Purchaser) and it shall sell to the Lead Investor for $100 a series of preferred stock
which contains the power to vote a number of votes equal to 51% of the number of votes eligible to vote at any special or annual
meeting of the Company s shareholders (with the power to take action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting)
for the sole purpose of amending the Company s Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized Common Stock. The Company
shall not enter into any agreement or file any amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (including the filing of a Certificate
of Designation) which conflicts with this Section 5(d) while the Notes (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and Warrants remain
outstanding.  

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above
the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares
upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any
public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under
this Warrant.  

Before
taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or
in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be
necessary from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.  

(e)  Jurisdiction .
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.  

(f)  Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered or if not exercised
on a cashless basis when Rule 144 is available, may have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws.  

(g)  Non-waiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision
of this Warrant or the Purchase Agreement, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant,
which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to
cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including those of appellate proceedings,
incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies
hereunder.  

(h)  Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.  

(i)  Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company.  

(j)  Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate or that there is no irreparable harm
and not to require the posting of a bond or other security.  

(k)  Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.  

(l)  Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and Holders of
100% of the outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.  

(m)  Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant.  

(n)  Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of
this Warrant.

notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of the time or place thereof (except such notice as is required above or

4.8  Private
Sale . Each Debtor recognizes that the Secured Party may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Collateral
consisting of securities by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Act  ),
and applicable state securities laws, but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group
of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such Collateral for their own account for investment
and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Debtor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may
result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and each Debtor agrees that
it is not commercially unreasonable for Secured Party to engage in any such private sales or dispositions under such circumstances.
The Secured Party shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Collateral to permit a Debtor to register such Collateral
for public sale under the Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if Debtors would agree to do so. The Secured Party
shall not incur any liability as a result of the sale of any such Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale provided
for in this Agreement conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, and so long as Secured Party conducts such sale in a commercially
reasonable manner each Debtor hereby waives any claims against the Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price
at which the Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a
public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the Secured Party accepts the first offer received
and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree.  

Each
Debtor further agrees to do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale or sales
of any portion or all of any such Collateral valid and binding and in compliance with any and all applicable laws, regulations,
orders, writs, injunctions, decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators or governmental instrumentalities, domestic or
foreign, having jurisdiction over any such sale or sales, all at such Debtor s expense. Each Debtor further agrees that
a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 4.8 will cause irreparable injury to the Secured Party, that the Secured
Party has no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, agrees that each and every covenant contained
in this Section 4.8 shall be specifically enforceable against Debtors, and each Debtor hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing.  

4.9  Application
of Proceeds . The proceeds of any collection, sale or other realization of all or any part of the Collateral, and any other
cash at the time held by the Secured Party under this Agreement, shall be applied to the Obligations in such order as Secured
Party shall elect.

to the order of a blank payee;  

(c) deliver

Partial Release of Collateral . This Agreement and the Liens and security interests granted hereunder shall not terminate until
the full and complete performance and indefeasible satisfaction of  all of the Notes (including, without limitation, the indefeasible
payment in full in cash of all obligations under such Notes)  and (ii) with respect to which claims have been asserted by Collateral
Agent and/or Purchasers, whereupon the Secured Party shall forthwith cause to be assigned, transferred and delivered, against
receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, any remaining Collateral to or on the order of Debtors.
The Secured Party shall also execute and deliver to Debtors upon such termination and at Debtors  expense such UCC termination

Assurances . At any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Secured Party or its Representative, and at
the sole expense of Debtors, Debtors will promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further instruments, documents
and agreements and take such further actions as the Secured Party or its Representative may reasonably require in order for the
Secured Party to obtain the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted in favor of the Secured
Party, including, without limitation, using Debtors  best efforts to secure all consents and approvals necessary or appropriate
for the assignment to the Secured Party of any Collateral held by Debtors or in which a Debtor has any rights not heretofore assigned,
the filing of any financing or continuation statements under the UCC with respect to the liens and security interests granted
hereby, transferring Collateral to the Secured Party s possession (if a security interest in such Collateral can be perfected
by possession), placing the interest of the Secured Party as lienholder on the certificate of title of any Motor Vehicle, and
obtaining waivers of liens from landlords and mortgagees. Each Debtor also hereby authorizes the Secured Party and its Representative
to file any such financing or continuation statement without the signature of such Debtor to the extent permitted by applicable
law.  

4.14  Limitation
on Duty of Secured Party . The powers conferred on the Secured Party under this Agreement are solely to protect the Secured

of such powers and neither the Secured Party nor its Representative nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents shall be responsible to Debtors for any act or failure to act, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Secured Party and any Representative shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody
and preservation of the Collateral in their possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that
which the relevant Secured Party or any Representative, in its individual capacity, accords its own property consisting of the
type of Collateral involved, it being understood and agreed that neither the Secured Party nor any Representative shall have any
responsibility for taking any necessary steps (other than steps taken in accordance with the standard of care set forth above)
to preserve rights against any Person with respect to any Collateral.  

Also
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Secured Party nor any Representative shall have any obligation or
liability under any Contract or license by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the granting to the Secured Party of
a security interest therein or assignment thereof or the receipt by the Secured Party or any Representative of any payment relating
to any Contract or license pursuant hereto, nor shall the Secured Party or any Representative be required or obligated in any
manner to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of Debtors under or pursuant to any Contract or license, or to make any payment,
or to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or the sufficiency of any performance
by any party under any Contract or license, or to present or file any claim, or to take any action to collect or enforce any performance
or the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

C.

D.

(a)
The Pledgor hereby pledges, assigns, hypothecates, transfers, delivers and grants to Pledgee, for the benefit of itself and the
Purchasers, a first lien on and first priority perfected security interest in (i) all of the Pledged Equity and other equity interests
of the Pledge Entities now owned or hereafter acquired by such Pledgor (collectively, the  Pledged Interests ), (ii)
any other shares of Pledged Equity hereafter pledged or referred to be pledged to the Pledgee pursuant to this Agreement; (ii)
all  investment property  as such term is defined in  9-102(a)(49) of the UCC (as defined below) with respect
thereto; (iv) any  security entitlement  as such term is defined in   8-102(a)(17) of the UCC with respect thereto;

foregoing, including, without limitation, all distributions (cash, stock, or otherwise), dividends, stock dividends, securities,
cash, instruments, rights to subscribe, purchase, or sell, and other property, rights, and interest that such Pledgor is at any
time entitled to receive or is otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the Pledged Collateral (as
defined below), and without affecting the obligations of the Pledgor under any provision of the Security Agreement, in the event
of any consolidation or merger in which the Pledgor is not the surviving corporation, all shares of each class or Pledged Equity
of the successor entity formed by or resulting from such consolidation or merger (the collateral described in  clauses (i) 
through (vi) of this Section 2 being collectively referred to as the  Pledged Collateral ), as collateral security
for the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of
the Obligations. All of the Pledged Interests now owned by the Pledgor which are presently represented by certificates are listed
on  Exhibit A  hereto, which certificates, with undated assignments separate from certificates or stock/membership interest
powers duly executed in blank by such Pledgor and irrevocable proxies, are being delivered to Pledgee simultaneously herewith.
Upon the creation or acquisition of any new Pledged Interests, Pledgor shall execute an Addendum in the form of  Exhibit B 
attached hereto (a  Pledge Addendum ). Any Pledged Collateral described in a Pledge Addendum executed by Pledgor shall
thereafter be deemed to be listed on  Exhibit A  hereto. Pledgee shall maintain possession and custody of the certificates
representing the Pledged Interests and any additional Pledged Collateral.  

(b)
Each Pledged Interest consisting of either (i) a membership interest in a Person that is a limited liability company or (ii) a
partnership interest in a Person that is a partnership (if any) (1) is not and will not be evidenced by a certificate and (2)
is not and will not be deemed a  security  governed by Article 8 of the UCC.  

3.
 Representations and Warranties of Pledgor . The Pledgor represents and warrants to Pledgee, and covenants with Pledgee,
that:  

(a)
 Exhibit A  sets forth (i) the authorized capital stock and other equity interests of each Pledge Entity, (ii) the number
of shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each Pledge Entity that are issued and outstanding as of the date hereof,
and (iii) the percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each Pledge Entity
held by such Pledgor. Such Pledgor is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good and marketable title to, the Pledged Interests
of such Pledgor, and such shares are and will remain free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests and other encumbrances
and restrictions whatsoever, except the liens and security interests in favor of Pledgee created by this Agreement;  

(b)
Except as set forth on  Exhibit A , there are no outstanding options, warrants or other similar agreements with respect to
the Pledged Interests or any of the other Pledged Collateral;  

(c)
This Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Pledgor, enforceable against the Pledgor in accordance with its
terms except to the extent that such enforceability is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance and moratorium laws and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors  rights generally,
or the availability of equitable remedies, which are subject to the discretion of the court before which an action may be brought;  

(d)
The Pledged Interests have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and the Pledged Interests
listed on  Exhibit A  constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of the Pledge
Entities;  

(e)
No consent, approval or authorization of or designation or filing with any governmental or regulatory authority on the part of
the Pledgor is required in connection with the pledge and security interest granted under this Agreement;  

(f)
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not violate any provision of any applicable law or regulation or
of any order, judgment, writ, award or decree of any court, arbitrator or governmental authority, which are applicable to the
Pledgor, or of the articles or certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws or any other similar organizational
documents of the Pledgor or any Pledge Entity or of any securities issued by the Pledgor or any Pledge Entity or of any mortgage,
indenture, lease, contract, or other agreement, instrument or undertaking to which the Pledgor or any Pledge Entity is a party
or which is binding upon the Pledgor or any Pledge Entity or upon any of the assets of the Pledgor or any Pledge Entity, and will
not result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance on or security interest in any of the assets of the
Pledgor or any Pledge Entity, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement;  

(g)
The pledge, assignment and delivery of the Pledged Interests and the other Pledged Collateral pursuant to this Agreement creates
a valid first lien on and perfected first priority security interest in such Pledged Interests and Pledged Collateral and the
proceeds thereof in favor of Pledgee, subject to no prior pledge, lien, mortgage, hypothecation, security interest, charge, option
or encumbrance or to any agreement purporting to grant to any third party a security interest in the property or assets of Pledgor
which would include the Pledged Interests or any other Pledged Collateral. Until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
11 hereof, the Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will defend, for the benefit of Pledgee, Pledgee s right, title and
security interest in and to the Pledged Interests, the other Pledged Collateral and the proceeds thereof against the claims and
demands of all other persons or entities; and  

(h)
Neither the Pledgor nor any Pledged Entity (i) will become a person whose property or interests in property are blocked or subject
to blocking pursuant to Section 1 of Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions
with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit or Support Terrorism (66 Fed. Reg. 49079(2001), (ii) will engage in any dealings or
transactions prohibited by Section 2 of such executive order, or (iii) will otherwise become a person on the list of Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons or subject to the limitations or prohibitions under any other Office of Foreign Asset
Control regulation or executive order.  

4.
 Dividends, Distributions, Etc.  If, prior to irrevocable repayment in full in cash of the Obligations, the Pledgor shall
receive any certificate (including, without limitation, any certificate representing a dividend or a distribution in connection
with any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital, or issued in connection with any reorganization, merger or consolidation),
or any options or rights, whether as an addition to, in substitution for, or in exchange for any of the Pledged Interests or otherwise,
such Pledgor agrees, in each case, to accept the same as Pledgee s agent and to hold the same in trust for Pledgee, and
to deliver the same promptly (but in any event within five days) to Pledgee in the exact form received, with the endorsement of
such Pledgor when necessary and/or with appropriate undated assignments separate from certificates or stock powers duly executed
in blank, to be held by Pledgee subject to the terms hereof, as additional Pledged Collateral. The Pledgor shall promptly deliver
to Pledgee (i) a Pledge Addendum with respect to such additional certificates, and (ii) any financing statements or amendments
to financing statements as requested by Pledgee. The Pledgor hereby authorizes Pledgee to attach each such Pledge Addendum to
this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 5(b) below, all sums of money and property so paid or distributed in respect of
the Pledged Interests which are received by the Pledgor shall, until paid or delivered to Pledgee, be held by Pledgor in trust
as additional Pledged Collateral.  

5.
 Voting Rights; Dividends; Certificates .  

(a)
So long as no Event of Default (as defined in the Notes) has occurred and is continuing, the Pledgor shall be entitled (subject
to the other provisions hereof, including, without limitation, Section 8 below) to exercise its voting and other consensual rights
with respect to the Pledged Interests and otherwise exercise the incidents of ownership thereof in any manner not inconsistent
with this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and/or any of the other Transaction Documents. The Pledgor hereby grants to Pledgee
or its nominee, an irrevocable proxy to exercise all voting, corporate and limited liability company rights relating to the Pledged
Interests in any instance, which proxy shall be effective, at the discretion of Pledgee, upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default. Upon the request of Pledgee at any time, The Pledgor agrees to deliver to Pledgee such further evidence
of such irrevocable proxy or such further irrevocable proxies to vote the Pledged Interests as Pledgee may request.  

(b)
So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgor shall be entitled to receive cash dividends
or other distributions made in respect of the Pledged Interests, to the extent permitted to be made pursuant to the terms of the
Notes and the Purchase Agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in the event that the
Pledgor, as record and beneficial owner of the Pledged Interests, shall have received or shall have become entitled to receive,
any cash dividends or other distributions in the ordinary course, such Pledgor shall deliver to Pledgee, and Pledgee shall be
entitled to receive and retain, for the benefit of Pledgee and the Purchasers, all such cash or other distributions as additional
security for the Obligations.  

(c)
Subject to any sale or other disposition by Pledgee of the Pledged Interests, any other Pledged Collateral or other property pursuant
to this Agreement, upon the indefeasible full payment in cash, satisfaction and termination of all of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11 hereof and of the liens and security interests hereby granted, the Pledged
Interests, the other Pledged Collateral and any other property then held as part of the Pledged Collateral in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement shall be returned to the Pledgor or to such other persons or entities as shall be legally entitled
thereto.  

(d)
The Pledgor shall cause all Pledged Interests (other than the Pledged Interests consisting of limited liability company interests)
to be certificated at all times while this Agreement is in effect.  

6.
 Rights of Pledgee . Pledgee shall not be liable for failure to collect or realize upon the Obligations or any collateral
security or guaranty therefor, or any part thereof, or for any delay in so doing, nor shall Pledgee be under any obligation to
take any action whatsoever with regard thereto. Any or all of the Pledged Interests held by Pledgee hereunder may, if an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, without notice, be registered in the name of Pledgee or its nominee, and Pledgee or
its nominee may thereafter without notice exercise all voting and corporate rights at any meeting with respect to any Pledge Entity
and exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to
any of the Pledged Interests as if it were the absolute owner thereof, including, without limitation, the right to vote in favor
of, and to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Pledged Interests upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization
or other readjustment with respect to any Pledge Entity or upon the exercise by any Pledge Entity, the Pledgor or Pledgee of any
right, privilege or option pertaining to any of the Pledged Interests, and in connection therewith, to deposit and deliver any
and all of the Pledged Interests with any committee, depository, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such
terms and conditions as Pledgee may reasonably determine, all without liability except to account for property actually received
by Pledgee, but Pledgee shall have no duty to exercise any of the aforesaid rights, privileges or options and shall not be responsible
for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.  

7.
 Remedies . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Pledgee may exercise in respect of the
Pledged Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights
and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) of the jurisdiction applicable to the affected
Pledged Collateral from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, Pledgee may, without demand of performance or other demand,
advertisement or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon
the Pledgor or any other person or entity (all and each of which demands, advertisements and/or notices are hereby expressly waived),
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon
the Pledged Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith date and otherwise fill in the blanks on any assignments separate
from certificates or stock power or otherwise sell, assign, give an option or options to purchase, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of and deliver said Pledged Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more portions at one or more public or private
sales or dispositions, at any exchange or broker s board or at any of Pledgee s offices or elsewhere upon such terms
and conditions as Pledgee may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for any combination of cash and/or securities
or other property or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, with the right to Pledgee upon any
such sale, public or private, to purchase the whole or any part of said Pledged Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity
of redemption in Pledgor, which right or equity is hereby expressly waived or released. Pledgee shall apply the net proceeds of
any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization, sale or disposition, after deducting all costs and expenses
of every kind incurred therein or incidental to the safekeeping of any and all of the Pledged Collateral or in any way relating
to the rights of Pledgee hereunder, including reasonable attorneys  fees and legal expenses, to the payment, in whole or
in part, of the Obligations, in such order as Pledgee may elect. The Pledgor shall remain liable for any deficiency remaining
unpaid after such application. Only after so paying over such net proceeds and after the payment by Pledgee of any other amount
required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-608 of the UCC, need Pledgee account for the surplus,
if any, to the Pledgor. The Pledgor agrees that Pledgee need not give more than ten (10) days  notice of the time and place
of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale or other intended disposition is to take place and that such notice
is reasonable notification of such matters. No notification need be given to the Pledgor if it has signed after default a statement
renouncing or modifying any right to notification of sale or other intended disposition. Notwithstanding any provision in any
operating agreement or shareholder agreement of any issuer of the Pledged Collateral or the Delaware Limited Liability Company
Act or any applicable laws to the contrary, the undersigned constituting all of the members and/or shareholders of each issuer
hereby acknowledge that such member and/or shareholder, as applicable, may pledge to the Agent all of such member s and/or
shareholder s right, title and interest in such issuer, and upon foreclosure the successful bidder (which may include the
Agent) will be deemed admitted as a member and/or shareholder, as applicable, of such issuer, and will automatically succeed to
all of such pledged right, title and interest, including without limitation such members  and/or shareholder s limited
liability company and equity interests, right to vote and participate in the management and business affairs of the issuer, right
to a share of the profits and losses of the issuer and right to receive distributions from the issuer.  

8.
 No Disposition, Etc.  Until the irrevocable payment in full, satisfaction or expiration of the Notes, the Pledgor agrees
that it will not sell, assign, transfer, exchange, or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, the Pledged Interests
or any other Pledged Collateral, nor will the Pledgor create, incur or permit to exist any pledge, lien, mortgage, hypothecation,
security interest, charge, option or any other encumbrance with respect to any of the Pledged Interests or any other Pledged Collateral,
or any interest therein, or any proceeds thereof, except for the lien and security interest of Pledgee provided for by this Agreement
and the Security Agreement and Permitted Encumbrance, as defined in the Purchase Agreement.  

9.
 Sale of Pledged Interests .  

(a)
The Pledgor recognizes that Pledgee may be unable to effect a public sale or disposition (including, without limitation, any disposition
in connection with a merger of a Pledge Entity) of any or all the Pledged Interests by reason of certain prohibitions contained
in the Securities Act, and applicable state securities laws, but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales or dispositions
thereof to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their
own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that
any such private sale or disposition may result in prices and other terms (including the terms of any securities or other property
received in connection therewith) less favorable to the seller than if such sale or disposition were a public sale or disposition
and the Pledgor agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for Pledgee to engage in any such private sales or dispositions
under such circumstances. Pledgee shall be under no obligation to delay a sale or disposition of any of the Pledged Interests
in order to permit the Pledgor or a Pledge Entity to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under
applicable state securities laws, even if such Pledgor or a Pledge Entity would agree to do so.  

(b)
The Pledgor further agrees to do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary to make such
sales or dispositions of the Pledged Interests valid and binding and in compliance with any and all applicable laws, regulations,
orders, writs, injunctions, decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators or governmental instrumentalities, domestic or
foreign, having jurisdiction over any such sales or dispositions, all at such Pledgor s expense; provided that the Pledgor
shall have any obligation to register the Pledged Interests as securities under the Securities Act or the applicable state securities
laws solely by virtue of this Section 9(b). The Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in Sections
4, 5(a), 5(b), 8, 9 and 24 will cause irreparable injury to Pledgee and that Pledgee has no adequate remedy at law in respect
of such breach and, as a consequence, agrees, without limiting the right of Pledgee to seek and obtain specific performance of
other obligations of the Pledgor contained in this Agreement, that each and every covenant referenced above shall be specifically
enforceable against the Pledgor, and the Pledgor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific
performance of such covenants.  

(c)
The Pledgor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers, Pledgee and their respective successors and assigns,
their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and any person or entity in control of any thereof, from
and against any loss, liability, claim, damage and expense, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses (in this paragraph
collectively called the  Indemnified Liabilities ), under federal and state securities laws or otherwise insofar as
such Indemnified Liability (i) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any registration statement, prospectus or offering memorandum or in any preliminary prospectus or preliminary offering
memorandum or in any amendment or supplement to any thereof or in any other writing prepared by the Pledgor in connection with
the offer, sale or resale of all or any portion of the Pledged Collateral unless such untrue statement of material fact was provided
by Pledgee, in writing, specifically for inclusion therein, or (ii) arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, such indemnification
to remain operative regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Pledgee or any successor thereof, or any person or
entity in control of any thereof. In connection with a public sale or other distribution, the Pledgor will provide customary indemnification
to any underwriters, their successors and assigns, officers and directors and each person or entity who controls any such underwriter
(within the meaning of the Securities Act). If and to the extent that the foregoing undertakings in this paragraph may be unenforceable
for any reason, the Pledgor agrees to jointly and severally make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each
of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. The obligations of the Pledgor under this  paragraph
(c)  shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  

(d)
The Pledgor further agrees not to exercise any and all rights of subrogation it may have against a Pledge Entity upon the sale
or disposition of all or any portion of the Pledged Collateral by Pledgee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 11 below.  

10.
 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies . Pledgee shall not by any act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any
of its remedies hereunder, and no waiver by Pledgee shall be valid unless in writing and signed by Pledgee, and then only to the
extent therein set forth. A waiver by Pledgee of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a
bar to any right or remedy which Pledgee would otherwise have on any further occasion. No course of dealing between the Pledgor
and Pledgee and no failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising on the part of Pledgee or the Purchasers of, any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents shall impair such right or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and may be exercised
singly or concurrently, and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or in the Purchase Agreement.  

11.
 Termination . This Agreement and the liens and security interests granted hereunder shall terminate and Pledgee, at the
Pledgor s sole cost and expense, shall return any Pledged Interests or other Pledged Collateral then held by Pledgee in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement to Pledgor upon the full and complete performance and indefeasible satisfaction
of all of the Notes (including, without limitation, the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all obligations under such Notes)
and (ii) with respect to which claims have been asserted by Pledgee and/or Purchasers.  

12.
 Possession of Collateral . Beyond the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Pledged Interests in
the physical possession of Pledgee pursuant hereto, neither Pledgee, nor any nominee of Pledgee, shall have any duty or liability
to collect any sums due in respect thereof or to protect, preserve or exercise any rights pertaining thereto (including any duty
to ascertain or take action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to the
Pledged Collateral and any duty to take any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to the Pledged
Collateral), and shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Pledged Collateral upon surrendering them to the Pledgor. The
Pledgor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the financial condition of a Pledge Entity and of
all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of non-payment of the Obligations, and Pledgee shall have no duty to advise the
Pledgor of information known to Pledgee regarding such condition or any such circumstance. Pledgee shall have no duty to inquire
into the powers of a Pledge Entity or its officers, directors, managers, members, partners or agents thereof acting or purporting
to act on its behalf.  

13.
 Taxes and Expenses . The Pledgor will jointly and severally pay to Pledgee within the Applicable Time Frame (as hereafter
defined) (a) any taxes (excluding income taxes, franchise taxes or other taxes levied on gross earnings, profits or the like of
Pledgee) payable or ruled payable by any Governmental Authority (as defined in the Security Agreement) in respect of this Agreement,
together with interest and penalties, if any, and (b) all expenses, including the fees and expenses of counsel for Pledgee and
of any experts and agents that Pledgee may incur in connection with (i) the administration, modification or amendment of this
Agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Pledged
Collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Pledgee hereunder, or (iv) the failure of Pledgor to perform
or observe any of the provisions hereof. For purposes hereof, the term  Applicable Time Frame  means the earlier of
(a) ten (10) days after Pledgee s written demand for such payment and (b) the date set forth in Pledgee s written
demand for such payment if such payment is required to be made by Pledgee prior to the ten (10) day period referred to in the
foregoing clause  (a).   

14.
 Pledgee Appointed Attorney-In-Fact . The Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints Pledgee as such Pledgor s attorney-in-fact,
with full authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor or otherwise, from time to time in
Pledgee s discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument that Pledgee deems reasonably necessary or advisable
to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, to receive, endorse and collect all instruments made
payable to such Pledgor representing any dividend, interest payment or other distribution in respect of the Pledged Collateral
or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same, when and to the extent permitted by this Agreement; provided that
the power of attorney granted hereunder shall only be exercised by Pledgee after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default.  

15.
 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Jury Trial . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation
of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder
or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any
such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served
in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing by registered or certified mail a copy thereof to such party at the address
for such notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process
and notice thereof five (5) business days after the mailing thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any
way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pledgee may enforce its rights
and remedies in any other jurisdiction applicable to the Pledged Collateral. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ARISING
OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.  

16.
 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which together shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other
party; provided that a facsimile, .pdf or similar electronically transmitted signature shall be considered due execution and shall
be binding upon the signatory thereto with the same force and effect as if the signature were an original signature.  

17.
 Headings . The headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation
of, this Agreement.  

18.
 Severability . If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity
or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or
the validity or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.  

19.

ORAL OR WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PLEDGOR, PLEDGEE, THEIR AFFILIATES AND PERSONS ACTING ON THEIR BEHALF WITH RESPECT TO THE

NOW,
THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and in order to induce Purchasers to make the Loans, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally
agrees as follows:  

1.  Definitions : Capitalized
terms used herein without definition and defined in the Purchase Agreement are used herein as defined therein. In addition, as
used herein:  

Bankruptcy
Code  shall mean the Federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C.  101,  et seq. ), as amended and in effect
from time to time thereunder.  

Obligations 
shall mean (i) all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of every nature of each Company from time to time owed or owing to
the Purchasers and Agent arising under, out of or in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Notes, the Loans and the other
Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the principal amount of all debts, claims and indebtedness, accrued and
unpaid interest and all fees, taxes, indemnities, costs and expenses, whether primary, secondary, direct, contingent, fixed or
otherwise, heretofore, now and/or from time to time hereafter owing, due or payable, whether before or after the filing of a bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceeding under applicable federal, state, foreign or other law and whether or not an allowed claim in
any such proceeding, and (ii) all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of every nature of any subsequent Guarantor from time
to time owed or owing to the Purchasers and/or Agent, under or in respect of this Guaranty, the Pledge Agreement, the Security
Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, the Notes, the Loans and the other Transaction Documents, as the case may be, including, without

hereafter owing, due or payable, whether before or after the filing of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding under applicable
federal, state, foreign or other law and whether or not an allowed claim in any such proceeding.  

2.    Guaranty of Payment   

(a)
Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment and
performance to Purchasers and Agent, on behalf of itself and in its capacity as agent for the benefit of Purchasers, when
due, upon demand, at maturity or by reason of acceleration or otherwise and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the
Obligations.  

(b)
Each Guarantor acknowledges that valuable consideration supports this Guaranty, including, without limitation, the
consideration set forth in the recitals above, as well as any commitment to lend, extension of credit or other financial
accommodation, whether heretofore or hereafter made by Purchasers to any Company; any extension, renewal or replacement of
any of the Obligations; any forbearance with respect to any of the Obligations or otherwise; any cancellation of an existing
guaranty; any purchase of any Company s assets by any Purchaser or Agent; or any other valuable
consideration.  

(c)
Each Guarantor agrees that all payments under this Guaranty shall be made in United States currency and in the same manner as
provided for the Obligations.  

(d)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, it is intended that this Guaranty, and any interests, liens
and security interests granted by Guarantors as security for this Guaranty, not constitute a  Fraudulent
Conveyance  (as defined below) in the event that this Guaranty or such interest is subject to the Bankruptcy Code or
any applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of any state. Consequently, Guarantors, Agent
and Purchasers agree that if this Guaranty, or any such interests, liens or security interests securing this Guaranty, would,
but for the application of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, this Guaranty and each such lien and security
interest shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause this Guaranty or such interest, lien
or security interest to constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, and this Guaranty shall automatically be deemed to have been
amended accordingly at all relevant times. For purposes hereof,  Fraudulent Conveyance  means a fraudulent
conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the provisions of
any applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of any state, as in effect from time to
time.  

3.  Costs
and Expenses . Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agrees to pay on demand, all reasonable costs and expenses of every
kind incurred by any Purchaser or Agent: (a) in enforcing this Guaranty, (b) in collecting any of the Obligations from any Company
or any Guarantor, (c) in realizing upon or protecting or preserving any collateral for this Guaranty or for payment of any of
the Obligations, and (d) in connection with any amendment of, modification to, waiver or forbearance granted under, or enforcement
or administration of any Transaction Document or for any other purpose in connection with any Transaction Document, in each case,
to the extent Purchaser or Agent may take such action pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Costs and
expenses  as used in the preceding sentence shall include, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees incurred
by any Purchaser or Agent in retaining legal counsel for advice, suit, appeal, any insolvency or other proceedings under the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise, or for any purpose specified in the preceding.  

4.  Nature
of Guaranty: Continuing, Absolute and Unconditional .  

(a) This
Guaranty is and is intended to be a continuing guaranty of payment of the Obligations, and not of collectability, and is intended
to be independent of and in addition to any other guaranty, endorsement, collateral or other agreement held by Purchasers or Agent
therefor or with respect thereto, whether or not furnished by a Guarantor. None of Purchasers and Agent shall be required to prosecute
collection, enforcement or other remedies against any Company, any other Guarantor or guarantor of the Obligations or any other
person or entity, or to enforce or resort to any of the Collateral or other rights or remedies pertaining thereto, before calling
on a Guarantor for payment. The obligations of each Guarantor to repay the Obligations hereunder shall be unconditional. Guarantor
shall have no right to exercise any right of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim
which it may now or hereafter have against any Company in connection with this Guaranty until the termination of this Guaranty
in accordance with Section 8 below, and hereby waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral
given to Purchasers to secure payment of the Obligations, and each Guarantor agrees that it will not take any action to enforce
any obligations of any Company to such Guarantor prior to the Obligations being finally and irrevocably paid in full in cash,
 provided  that, in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of any Company, to the extent the Obligations have not been
finally and irrevocably paid in full in cash, Agent, for the benefit of itself and Purchasers, and Purchasers shall be entitled
notwithstanding the foregoing, to file in the name of any Guarantor or in its own name a claim for any and all indebtedness owing
to a Guarantor by such Company (exclusive of this Guaranty), vote such claim and to apply the proceeds of any such claim to the
Obligations.  

(b) For
the further security of Purchasers and without in any way diminishing the liability of the Guarantors, following the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all debts and liabilities, present or future, of the Companies to the Guarantors,
and all monies received from any Company or for its account by the Guarantors in respect thereof shall be received in trust for
Purchasers and Agent and promptly following receipt shall be paid over to Agent, for its benefit and in its capacity as Agent
for the benefit of Purchasers, until all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. This assignment and postponement is
independent of and severable from this Guaranty and shall remain in full effect whether or not any Guarantor is liable for any
amount under this Guaranty.  

(c) This
Guaranty is absolute and unconditional and shall not be changed or affected by any representation, oral agreement, act or thing
whatsoever, except as herein provided. This Guaranty is intended by the Guarantors to be the final, complete and exclusive expression
of the guaranty agreement among the Companies (as limited by the express terms of this Guaranty), the Guarantors, the Agent and
Purchasers. No modification or amendment of any provision of this Guaranty shall be effective against any party hereto unless
in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of such party. This Guaranty, together with the other Transaction Documents,
supersedes all other prior oral or written agreements between each Purchaser, the Guarantors, the Agent, their Affiliates and
Persons acting on their behalf with respect to the matters discussed herein, and this Guaranty, together with the other Transaction
Documents and the other instruments referenced herein and therein, contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect
to the matters covered herein and therein and, except as specifically set forth herein or therein, neither any Guarantor, the
Agent nor any Purchaser makes any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking with respect to such matters. As of the date
of this Guaranty, there are no unwritten agreement between the parties with respect to the matters discussed herein. No provision
of this Guaranty may be amended, modified or supplemented other than by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.  

(d) Each
Guarantor hereby releases each Company from all, and agrees not to assert or enforce (whether by or in a legal or equitable proceeding
or otherwise) any,  claims  (as defined in Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code), whether arising under any law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, order, policy or other requirement of any domestic or foreign Governmental Authority or any instrumentality
or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of its business or assets or otherwise, to which the Guarantors are or
would at any time be entitled by virtue of its obligations hereunder, any payment made pursuant hereto or the exercise by any
Purchaser or Agent of its rights with respect to the Collateral, including any such claims to which such Guarantors may be entitled
as a result of any right of subrogation, exoneration or reimbursement.  

5.  Certain
Rights and Obligations.   

(a) Each
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that Purchasers and Agent, for its benefit and as agent for the benefit of Purchasers, may,

who has given any security interest in any collateral as security for the payment of the Obligations or any part thereof, or any
other person or entity in any way obligated to pay the Obligations or any part thereof, and enforce or refrain from enforcing,
or compromise or modify, the terms of any obligation of any such endorser, guarantor, or person or entity;  

(iv) dispose
of any and all collateral securing the Obligations in its reasonable discretion, as it may deem appropriate, and direct the order

part thereof as Agent in its reasonable discretion may determine;  

(v) subject
to the terms of the Notes, determine the manner, amount and time of application of payments and credits, if any, to be made on
all or any part of any component or components of the Obligations (whether principal, interest, fees, costs, and expenses, or
otherwise), including, without limitation, the application of payments received from any source to the payment of indebtedness
other than the Obligations even though Purchasers might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to the Obligations or to
amounts which are not covered by this Guaranty; and  

(vi) take
advantage or refrain from taking advantage of any security or accept or make or refrain from accepting or making any compositions
or arrangements when and in such manner as Agent, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate;  

and
generally do or refrain from doing any act or thing which might otherwise, at law or in equity, release the liability of such
Guarantor as a guarantor or surety in whole or in part, and in no case shall Purchasers or Agent be responsible or shall any Guarantor
be released either in whole or in part for any act or omission in connection with Purchasers or Agent having sold any security
at less than its value.

(i) without
deduction by reason of any setoff, defense (other than payment) or counterclaim of any Company or any other Guarantor;  

(ii) without
requiring presentment, protest or notice of nonpayment or notice of default to any Guarantor, to any Company or to any other person
or entity;  

(iii) without
demand for payment or proof of such demand or filing of claims with a court in the event of receivership, bankruptcy or reorganization
of any Company or any other Guarantor;  

(iv) without
requiring Purchasers or Agent to resort first to any Company (this being a guaranty of payment and not of collection), to any
other Guarantor, or to any other guaranty or any collateral which Purchasers or Agent may hold;  

(v) without
requiring notice of acceptance hereof or assent hereto by any Purchaser or Agent; and  

(vi) without

upon this Guaranty;  

all
of which each Guarantor hereby waives.

Guarantor s obligation hereunder shall not be affected by any of the following, all of which such Guarantor hereby waives:

(ix) any
change in, or the imposition of, any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in
any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the Obligations;  

(x) the
existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which the Guarantor, any Company, any other Guarantor or guarantor of the Obligations
or any other person or entity may have at any time against any Purchaser, Agent or any Company in connection herewith or any unrelated

from its obligations hereunder, all whether or not such Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xiv) of this Section 5(c).  

6.  Representations
and Warranties.  Each Guarantor further represents and warrants to Purchasers and Agent that: (a) such Guarantor is a corporation
or other entity duly incorporated or organized, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or formation, as applicable, and has full power, authority and legal right to own its property and assets
and to transact the business in which it is presently engaged; (b) such Guarantor has full power, authority and legal right to
execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, this Guaranty, and has taken all necessary action to authorize the
guarantee hereunder on the terms and conditions of this Guaranty and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Guaranty; (c) this Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by such Guarantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforceability

application affecting enforcement of creditors  rights generally, or the availability of equitable remedies, which are subject
to the discretion of the court before which an action may be brought; and (d) the execution, delivery and performance by each

the organizational documents of any Guarantor, (iii) any judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon
it, or (iv) any agreement binding upon it.  

7.  Negative
Covenants.  Each Guarantor covenants with Purchasers and Agent that such Guarantor shall not grant any security interest
in or permit any lien, claim or encumbrance upon any of its assets in favor of any person or entity other than liens and security
interests in favor of Purchasers and Agent and Permitted Encumbrances. Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not take any action
or engage in any transaction that such Guarantor is prohibited from taking or engaging in pursuant to the terms of the Purchase
Agreement. In addition, each Guarantor agrees to comply with the terms of the Purchase Agreement to the same extent that the Company
is required to cause the Guarantors to comply with such terms of the Purchase Agreement. Each Company, by its signature hereto,
hereby acknowledges and agrees that any breach by a Guarantor of any term or provision of this Guaranty or the Security Agreement,
which is not cured to the Agent s reasonable satisfaction within any applicable cure or grace period, shall constitute an
 Event of Default  under the Note.  

8.  Termination.  This
Guaranty shall not terminate until such time, if any, as (i) all Obligations shall be finally and irrevocably paid in full in
cash, (ii) no Notes shall remain outstanding, (iii) all commitments to lend under the Purchase Agreement shall have terminated
and (iv) there shall exist no other outstanding payment or reimbursement obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations
for which no claims shall have been asserted) of the Borrower or the Guarantors to the Agent under any of the Transaction Documents.
Thereafter, but subject to the following, Agent, on its behalf and as agent for Purchasers, shall take such action and execute
such documents as the Guarantors may request (and at the Guarantors  cost and expense) in order to evidence the termination
of this Guaranty. Payment of all of the Obligations owing from time to time shall not operate as a discontinuance of this Guaranty.
Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent that any Company makes a payment or payments to Purchasers or Agent on the Obligations,
or Purchasers or Agent receive any proceeds of collateral securing the Obligations or any other payments with respect to the Obligations,
which payment or receipt of proceeds or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be returned or repaid to any Company, its estate, trustee, receiver, debtor in possession or any other
person or entity, including, without limitation, the Guarantors, under any insolvency or bankruptcy law, state or federal law,
common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment, return or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which has
been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the date when
such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred, and this Guaranty shall continue in full force notwithstanding any contrary
action which may have been taken by any Purchaser or Agent in reliance upon such payment, and any such contrary action so taken
shall be without prejudice to any Purchaser s or Agent s rights under this Guaranty and shall be deemed to have been
conditioned upon such payment having become final and irrevocable.  

9.  Guaranty
of Performance.  Each Guarantor also guarantees the full, prompt and unconditional performance of all obligations and agreements
of every kind owed or hereafter to be owed by the Companies and the Guarantors to Purchasers and Agent under the Purchase Agreement,
the Notes, and the other Transaction Documents. Every provision for the benefit of Purchasers and Agent contained in this Guaranty
shall apply to the guaranty of performance given in this paragraph.  

10.  Assumption
of Liens and Obligations.  To the extent that a Guarantor has received or shall hereafter receive distributions or transfers
from any Company of property or cash that are subject, at the time of such contribution, to liens and security interests in favor
of Purchasers and/or the Agent in accordance with the Notes, the Security Agreement or any other Transaction Document, such Guarantor
hereby expressly agrees that (i) it shall hold such assets subject to such liens and security interests, and (ii) it shall be
liable for the payment of the Obligations secured thereby. Each Guarantor s obligations under this Section 10 shall be in
addition to its obligations as set forth in other sections of this Guaranty and not in substitution therefor or in lieu thereof.  

11.  Miscellaneous.   

(a) The
terms  Company  and  Guarantor  as used in this Guaranty shall include: (i) any successor individual or
individuals, association, partnership, limited liability company or corporation to which all or substantially all of the business
or assets of such Company or such Guarantor shall have been transferred and (ii) any other association, partnership, limited liability
company, corporation or entity into or with which such Company or such Guarantor shall have been merged, consolidated, reorganized,
or absorbed.  

(b) Without
limiting any other right of any Purchaser or Agent, whenever any Purchaser or Agent has the right to declare any of the Obligations
to be immediately due and payable (whether or not it has been so declared), Agent, on its behalf and in its capacity as agent
for the benefit of Purchasers, at its sole election without notice to the undersigned may appropriate and set off against the
Obligations:  

(i) any
and all indebtedness or other moneys due or to become due to any Guarantor by any Purchaser or Agent in any capacity; and  

(ii) any
credits or other property belonging to any Guarantor (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether
or not collected or available) at any time held by or coming into the possession of any Purchaser or Agent, or any affiliate of
any Purchaser or Agent, whether for deposit or otherwise;  

whether
or not the Obligations or the obligation to pay such moneys owed by any Purchaser or Agent is then due, and the applicable Purchaser
or Agent shall be deemed to have exercised such right of set off immediately at the time of such election even though any charge
therefor is made or entered on such Purchaser s or Agent s records subsequent thereto. Agent agrees to notify such
Guarantor in a reasonably practicable time of any such set-off; however, failure to so notify such Guarantor shall not affect
the validity of any set-off.  

(c) Each
Guarantor s obligation hereunder is to pay the Obligations in full in cash when due according to the Notes, the other Transaction
Documents, this Guaranty and the other agreements, documents and instruments governing the Obligations to the extent provided
herein, and shall not be affected by any stay or extension of time for payment by any Company or any other Guarantor resulting
from any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law.  

(d) No
course of dealing between any Company or any Guarantor and Purchasers or Agent and no act, delay or omission by Purchasers or
Agent in exercising any right or remedy hereunder or with respect to any of the Obligations shall operate as a waiver thereof
or of any other right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any Purchaser or Agent may remedy any default by any Company under any agreement
with any Company or with respect to any of the Obligations in any reasonable manner without waiving the default remedied and without
waiving any other prior or subsequent default by any Company. All rights and remedies of Purchasers and Agent hereunder are cumulative.  

(e) This
Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  

(f) Agent
may assign its rights hereunder without the consent of Guarantors, in which event such assignee shall be deemed to be Agent hereunder
with respect to such assigned rights.  

(g) Captions
of the sections of this Guaranty are solely for the convenience of the parties hereto, and are not an aid in the interpretation
of this Guaranty and do not constitute part of the agreement of the parties set forth herein.  

(h) If
any provision of this Guaranty is unenforceable in whole or in part for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to
be effective.  

(i) All
questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Guaranty shall be governed by the internal
laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of New York. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in
the City of New York, borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any
transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action
or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably
waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing by registered
or certified mail a copy thereof to such party at the address for such notices to it under this Guaranty and agrees that such
service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof as of the date that is five (5) business days
after the mailing thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner
permitted by law.  

12.  Notices .
All notices, approvals, requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be delivered or made in the manner set forth
in, and shall be effective in accordance with the terms of, the Purchase Agreement or, in the case of communications to the Agent,
directed to the notice address set forth in the Security Agreement; provided, that any communication shall be effective as to
any Guarantor if made or sent to OBMP in accordance with the foregoing.

THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT, EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO NOTICE AND HEARING OF ANY KIND PRIOR
TO THE EXERCISE BY ANY PURCHASER OR AGENT, ON ITS BEHALF AND IN ITS CAPACITY AS AGENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF PURCHASERS, OF ITS RIGHTS
TO REPOSSESS THE COLLATERAL WITHOUT JUDICIAL PROCESS OR TO REPLEVY, ATTACH OR LEVY UPON THE COLLATERAL WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR
HEARING. EACH GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN ADVISED BY COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE WITH RESPECT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND THIS
GUARANTY.  

(c) EACH

(a)  Definitions .
In this Section 15:  

(i)  Excluded
Taxes  means, with respect to the Agent or the Purchasers, or any other recipient of any payment to be made by or on account
of any obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, or under any other Security Document, income or franchise taxes imposed
on (or measured by) its net income by the United States of America or such other jurisdiction under the laws of which such recipient
is organized or in which its principal office is located.  

(ii)  Governmental
Authority  means the government of the United States of America or any other nation, or any political subdivision thereof,
whether state or local, or any agency, authority, instrumentality, regulatory body, court, central bank or other entity exercising
executive, legislative, judicial, taxing, regulatory or administrative powers or functions of or pertaining to government over
any of the Companies, or any of their respective properties, assets or undertakings.  

(iii)  Indemnified
Taxes  means Taxes other than Excluded Taxes.  

(iv)  Taxes 
means any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any Governmental
Authority.  

(b) Any
and all payments by or on account of the Obligations of any of the Guarantors under this Guaranty or any other Transaction Document
shall be made without any set-off, counterclaim or deduction and free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes;
provided that if any Guarantor shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 15(b)), the Agent or Purchasers, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  

16.  Indemnification
by the Guarantors . Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Agent and the Purchasers, within ten (10) days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes paid by the Agent or Purchasers, as applicable, on or with respect to any
payment by or on account of any obligation of such Guarantor under this Guaranty and the other Transaction Documents (including
Indemnified Taxes or imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 16) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate of the Agent or any Purchaser as to the amount of such
payment or liability under this Section 16 shall be delivered to such Guarantor and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  

17.  Counterparts;
 Headings. This Guaranty may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which together shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to each other
party; provided that a facsimile, .pdf or similar electronically transmitted signature shall be considered due execution and shall
be binding upon the signatory thereto with the same force and effect as if the signature were an original signature. The headings
in this Guaranty are for convenience of reference only and shall not alter or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.  

18.  Rights
of Contribution . The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor shall make an Excess Payment (as
defined below), such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor s
Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 18 shall
be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Obligations until such time as the Obligations have been paid in full in
cash and all commitments to lend under the Purchase Agreement have expired or terminated, and none of the Guarantors shall exercise
any right or remedy under this Section 18 against any other Guarantor until such Obligations have been paid in full in cash and
all commitments to lend under the Purchase Agreement have expired or terminated. For purposes of this Section 18, (a)  Excess
Payment  shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Ratable Share of any Obligations; (b)  Ratable
Share  shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any payment of Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as
of the date of such payment of Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets
and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate
present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of the Companies and the Guarantors exceeds the amount of all of
the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations
of the Guarantors hereunder) of the Companies and the Guarantors, provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Ratable
Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date
of any such payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and the financial information for such
Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such payment;
and (c)  Contribution Share  shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor,
the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair
salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including
contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the Obligations) of the Companies and the Guarantors
other than the maker of such Excess Payment; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the
Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment
shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as
of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment. This
Section 18 shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor
may have under law against any Company in respect of any payment of Obligations.
