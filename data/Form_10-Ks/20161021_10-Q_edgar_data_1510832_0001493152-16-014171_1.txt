Note
1 Basis of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain
information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive
presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is our opinion, however, that the accompanying unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary
for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.  

The accompanying unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November
30, 2015 as filed with the SEC, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with Management s
Discussion and Analysis, for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014. The financial information as of November 30, 2015
is derived from the audited financial statements presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30,
2015. The interim results for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the year ending November 30, 2016 or for any future interim periods. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

BioPower
evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as
embedded derivatives. The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued
expenses and loans. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity
or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.  

For
derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its
fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity,
is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of
the balance sheet date.  

Financial
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our balance sheets are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established
by GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into the following levels:  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Level
1  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  

Level
2  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and
liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data.  

Level
3  Inputs reflecting management s best estimates and assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing
assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation of the
instruments.  

A
financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.  

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below for the year ended November 30, 2015

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below for the quarter ended August 31, 2016  

The
following table presents details of the Company s level 3 derivative liabilities as of August 31, 2016 and November 30,
2015  

Revenue
Recognition Policy    

The
Company recognizes revenues from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of
direct labor and material costs to date to estimated total direct labor and material costs for each contract. This method is used
because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. Because of the inherent
uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change in the near term.  

Contract
costs include all direct labor and material cost and those indirect costs related to contract performance. General and administrative
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which
such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to
cost and income, which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.  

The
asset, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenues recognized in excess of
amounts billed. The liability, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, represents billing in excess of revenues recognized.
Revenues generated from services and consulting agreements are recognized when the services have been performed, all significant
contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting fees is reasonably assured.  

Reclassification
of Prior Year Presentation   

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on the reported results of operations.  

Note
2 Going Concern    

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,797,349 and net cash used in
operations of $360,617 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,531,665
and a stockholders  deficit of $3,801,830 at August 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Management s plans, which include potential asset
acquisitions, mergers or business combinations with other entities, further implementation of its business plan and continuing
to raise funds through debt and/or equity financings. The Company will likely rely upon related party debt and/or equity financing
in order to ensure the continuing existence of the business.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

with ASC 470,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The loan was deemed to have a beneficial conversion feature
because the fair value of the stock exceeded the effective conversion price embedded in the loan on the commitment date. Accordingly,
the Company recorded the value of the beneficial conversion feature, which was determined to be $8,333 as a discount to the loan
and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital.

7. Derivative Liabilities    

On
July 23, 2015, the Company entered into a convertible loan agreement with a third party investor who became The Company s
Chief Operating Officer. The Company received a total of $50,000 which bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on December 30,
2016. Interest shall accrue from the advancement date and shall be payable on December 30, 2016. Any portion of the loan and unpaid
interest are convertible at any time at the option of the lender into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price
of $0.15 per share. If an equity transaction occurs at a price below $0.15, then the conversion price will adjust to such price.  

On
this date of issuance, the Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $50,000 in connection with the initial valuation
of the derivative liability of the note to be amortized utilizing the effective interest method of accretion over the term of
the note. Further, the Company recognized a derivative liability of $111,074 and initial loss on derivative liability of $61,074
based on the Black Scholes pricing model. As of August 31, 2016, $38,497 of the debt discount has been amortized. The fair value
of the derivative liability at August 31, 2016 is $15,828 resulting in a gain on the change in fair value of the derivative of
$44,528. The Note is shown net of a derivative debt discount of $11,503 at August 31, 2016.  

Since
equity classification is not available for the conversion feature, we were required to bifurcate the embedded conversion feature
and carry it as a derivative liability, at fair value. Derivative financial instrument is carried initially and subsequently at
its fair values.  

We
estimated the fair value of the derivative on the inception date, and subsequently, using the Black-Scholes valuation technique,
adjusted for the effect of dilution, because that technique embodies all of the assumptions (including, volatility, expected terms,
and risk free rates) that are necessary to fair value complex derivate instruments.  

As
a result of the application of ASC No. 815 in period ended August 31, 2016 the fair value of the conversion feature is summarized
as follows:  

The
fair value at the commitment and re-measurement dates for the Company s derivative liabilities were based upon the following

Overview   

From
inception (September 13, 2010) to November 30, 2014, the Company focused on growing biomass crops coupled with the project development
of processing and/or conversion facilities to produce oils, biofuels, electricity and other biomass products. We also intended
to utilize licensed patented technology to convert biomass wastes into products and reduce the amount of waste going to landfills.
We are organized as a holding company. On October 24, 2014, the Company executed a Share Exchange Agreement with Green3Power Holdings
Company ( G3P ) to acquire G3P and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Green3Power Operations Inc., a Delaware corporation
( G3P OPS ) and Green3Power International Company, a Nevis Corporation ( G3PI ), which are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Company. This transaction was a stock for stock exchange, (See Share exchange Agreement). We conduct all of
our operations through Green3Power Holdings Company and their subsidiaries which are primarily engaged in the development of Renewable
Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Facilities using their unique turnkey exclusive global license to the gasification technology to convert
wastes into electricity and ultra-low sulfur renewable fuels. G3P intends to design, permit, procure equipment, manage construction
and provide operations and maintenance of the intended facilities. We intend to hold equity interests in the waste-to-energy facilities
on a global basis.  

We
will also provide waste remediation services on a global basis. Remediation waste is defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 260.10 as  all solid and hazardous wastes, and all media (including groundwater, surface water, soils, and sediments)
and debris, that are managed for implementing cleanup.   

On
August 4, 2015 the St. Lucie County Commissioners approved the contract and its revisions with G3P to build a $175 Million Renewable
Energy Facility on the St. Lucie County, Florida landfill using the G3P Gasification Technology. The contract provides for a 20
year waste stream of 1,000 tons per day of municipal solid waste, construction and demolition waste, green waste and tires. The
facility will convert the waste into approximately 60,000 gallons per day of ultra-low sulfur renewable synthetic fuel and 20,000
gallons of Naptha. Vanderweil Engineers and G3P have completed the Site Plan and are putting together the necessary documentation
for permit applications. There can be no assurance that G3P will successfully fund the $175 Million facility.  

Strategy     

Our
mission is to provide waste and energy solutions on a global basis. We intend to do this through a variety of service offerings,
including partially owning and operating and maintaining facilities for the conversion of waste to energy (known as  Waste-to-Energy 
or  WtE ). Waste-to-Energy serves two key markets as both an on-going waste management solution that is environmentally
superior to landfilling and as a source of clean energy that reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions.  

We
intend to use the following key strategies:  

Our
    exclusively licensed gasification technology can convert a variety of wastes into electricity or ultra-low sulfur, renewable
    synthetic fuel. The technology is modular and built to handle approximately 300 to 400 tons per day of waste per line of equipment.
    We can only use up to twelve (12) lines of equipment at a facility location because of the constraints of truck traffic per
    location. Because our licensed gasification is built in a series of lines, we are able to service and maintain the lines and
    systems while operating the facilities continuously.   

The
    Company intends to earn revenues from design, engineering, permitting, operations and maintenance fees and may also earn procurement
    fees from WtE projects.   

We
    have strategically aligned with Vanderweil Engineers to develop WtE facilities in the United States and internationally. Vanderweil
    has been in business since 1950 and its Power Engineering group is expert at developing, designing, engineering and permitting
    power generation facilities worldwide.   

The
    Company intends to maintain an equity interest of between twenty percent (20%) to one hundred percent (100%) in each of its
    developed projects.   

We
    have partnered and will partner with project development groups globally who have been in different stages of development
    of WtE projects.   

We
    intend to maximize the long-term value of WtE facilities by adding waste and off-take energy contracts, seeking incremental
    revenue opportunities and deploying new or improved technologies, systems and processes targeted at increasing revenue and
    reducing costs.   

We
    seek to grow primarily through the development of new facilities selected in markets where we believe that the tipping fees
    and off-take agreements will enable us to secure funding for the projects. We believe that our approach to these opportunities
    is highly-disciplined, both with regard to our required rates of return, necessary contract elements, regulatory issues and
    the manner in which potential new projects will be structured and financed.   

We
    intend to provide waste remediation services on a global basis by working with local contractors.   

Our
corporate headquarters are located at 1000 Corporate Drive, Suite 200, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33334 and our phone number is
(954) 202-6660. Our website can be found at www.biopowercorp.com. The information on our website is not incorporated in this report.  

Our
Business    

Our
Waste-to-Energy Business   

The
WtE facilities we intend to build may earn revenue from the following potential revenue streams:  

Prior
to the start-up of the facility:  

Design
    fees   

Engineering
    fees   

Permitting
    fees   

Procurement
    of equipment fees (usually 10% of the cost of equipment)   

Management
    of construction fees   

We
will always have an Operations and Maintenance Agreement to operate and maintain the facility for a minimum of fifteen years,
for each facility using our technology, with or without ownership in the facility.   

After
the start-up of a facility if we are an equity owner in the facility, we may earn:  

Tipping
    fees from the disposal and processing of each ton of waste   Waste Agreement usually twenty to thirty years; and   

Sale
    of electricity   Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) usually twenty to thirty years; or   

Sale
    of ultra-low sulfur renewable synthetic fuel (usually one year renewable to fifteen year);   

Recyclables
    recovered during the WtE process;   

Carbon
    credits, if available;   

RINS
      Renewable Identification Number under the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, good until 2022 and in California to 2033.   

In
order to finance projects through traditional project finance, long-term contracts (off-take agreements) need to be executed for
the sale of electricity or fuels in combination with a waste contract. There can be no assurance we will ever fund a facility,
bring the development of a WtE facility into operation, partially own a WtE facility or operate and maintain a WtE facility.  

We
have generated minimal revenues from business operations. Therefore, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means
there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months unless we obtain additional
capital to pay our bills. We have not generated enough revenues from operations combined with the revenues anticipated until we
finance our first waste-to-energy facility. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than revenues generated such as
from the proceeds of loans, sale of common shares and advances or loans from related parties.  

Licensed
Technologies   

Green 3 Power
Holdings Company   Licensed gasification technology for Waste-to-Energy Conversion    

G 3 P
has an exclusive global License for the use of the technologies and processes for building gasification facilities to convert
wastes into electricity and synthetic fuels. Once the royalties paid for the use of these technologies equal $10,000,000, G 3
P will then own 100% of the technologies and processes without any further license fees. The initial license fees are paid based
upon gross revenues of the facilities and their waste conversion operations using the gasification technologies and processes.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
response to financial reporting release FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, from
the SEC, we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used
in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on
the our financial condition. The accounting estimates involve certain assumptions that, if incorrect, could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our more significant accounting policies can be found Note 1 of our
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended November 30, 2015, as filed with the SEC. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during
the period covered by this report.  

Results
of Operations   

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
unable to continue in operation. We expect that we will require additional capital to meet our operating requirements. We expect
to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity and/or debt securities.  

Three
and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2015     

The
following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, results of operations information from our unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements:  

Revenues.
  During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $188,827 and $0, respectively; in gross
revenues relating to construction management. During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $0
and $11,827, respectively; in gross revenues relating to consulting. During the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recognized $428,610 and $0, respectively; in gross revenues relating to construction management. During the nine months
ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $31,460 and $29,190, respectively; in gross revenues relating to consulting.  

General
and Administrative Expenses.   Our general and administrative expenses are mainly comprised of compensation expense, corporate
overhead, development costs, and financial and administrative contracted services for professional services including legal and
accounting, SEC filing fees, and insurance. The decrease in our general and administrative expenses during the three months ended
August 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily attributable to the decreased compensation expense (see Note
8   Commitments and Contingencies). The increase in our general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended
August 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to the addition of the four G3P officers and stock based
compensation.  

Interest
Income.   Interest income on for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was $932 and $0, respectively.  

Interest
Expense.   Interest expense for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents the accretion
of debt discount to interest expense on our outstanding debt, as well as contractual interest expense on our notes payable and
convertible debt.  

Gain
(loss) on Derivatives.   The Company reported $21,659 and $12,269 losses on derivatives during the three months ended August
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company reported $27,669 gain on derivatives and $12,269 loss on derivatives during the nine
months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Financial Condition   

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities was $360,617 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared with $244,294 for the comparable
period in 2015. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 is mainly attributable to our
net loss of $1,797,349, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and stock based compensation. Net cash
used in operating activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 is mainly attributable to our net loss of $1,631,365, offset
by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and stock based compensation.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities    

We
have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the nine months
ended August 31, 2016 cash flows provided by financing activities was $433,500, compared to $281,650 for the comparable period
in 2015. We received $649,939 in proceeds from convertible debt and notes payable with third parties and related parties during
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $290,000 in proceeds from convertible debt and notes payable and the issuance
of equity with third parties during the nine months ended August 31, 2015. Management is seeking, and expects to continue to seek
to raise additional capital through equity and/or debt financings, including through one or more equity or debt financings to
fund its operations, and pay amounts due to its creditors and employees. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to raise such additional equity or debt financing or obtain such bank borrowings on terms satisfactory to the Company
or at all.  

The
Company does not currently have sufficient resources to cover on-going expenses and expansion. As of August 31, 2016, the Company
had cash of $20,332 and current liabilities of $1,796,702. Our current liabilities include accounts payable and accrued expenses
to related parties of $572,959. We have historically financed our operations primarily through private placements of common stock,
loans from third parties and loans from one of our Officers. We also plan on raising additional funds from investors to implement
our business model. In the event we are unsuccessful at raising additional funds from investors, this will have a negative impact
on our operations.  

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $1,797,349 and
net cash used in operations of $360,617 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016; and a working capital deficit of $1,531,665
at August 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Management s plans, which includes developing and
raising funds for WtE facilities and continuing to raise funds through debt and/or equity financings. The Company will likely
rely upon related party debt and/or equity financing in order to ensure the continuing existence of the business. The financial
statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets
and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Accounting Pronouncements

Note 3 to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.  

Off-Balance

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
