NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1   THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Financial Statement Presentation           The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for NABUFIT Global, Inc. ("NABUFIT Global") and its wholly-owned subsidiary NABUFIT Global ApS ("NABUFIT Denmark") (collectively "NABUFIT," "we", or "the Company") are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Nature of Operations     The Company designs, manufactures and markets the NABUFIT virtual training and fitness products and services, a state-of-the-art online fitness portal ("NABUFIT" or, the "Product") with the option of connecting existing and future monitoring devices (wearables, etc.) to the portal. The Product incorporates interaction and input through Microsoft  Kinect  and other technologies and the option for personal data collection, coaching and teaching through mentor services. 

Customers obtain access to the Product portal through the purchase of monthly or annual memberships and the downloading of the software or mobile device application.  The Product provides custom designed training plans, diet plans and access to mentors and coaching.

Through Microsoft  Kinect , the NABUFIT technology collects data and measures each exercise relatively to a set standard and past performances.  Based on the data collection and registration in the Kinect  module the user will receive immediate feedback, e.g. as a percentage, a graphic or an emoticon depending on how well the exercise has been performed. This provides a unique quality assurance ensuring maximum effect of the training. The quick feedback will also reduce the risk of injuries and streamline time spent on training.  Users can access training data, statistics and results online or through mobile device applications.

Membership of the portal is divided into two levels   a basic membership and a VIP membership.  The VIP membership was not available as of September 30, 2016 but is expected to be an option starting December 2016.  The difference between the levels of membership will be primarily based upon the access to features and to mentors.

The portal also offers a social forum for its users, where users can interact with like-minded members and train with them virtually. Some people will experience increased motivation by being part of a group. The member can allow others to see all or part of his profile. The personal profiles of the members can be matched, so the portal will suggest network and training mates, and thereby helping to ensure the optimum composition. It will be possible to do real-time training with training mates by sharing the screen in a videoconference on the portal.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Interim Financial Information        The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Accordingly, they are condensed and do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal recurring nature.  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the Registration Statement on Form S-1 ( No. 333-210325) . The accounting policies set forth in those annual financial statements are the same as the accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements, except as modified for appropriate interim financial statement presentation.

Principles of Consolidation     The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include operations and balances of NABUFIT Global, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary NABUFIT Global, ApS, ("NABUFIT Denmark").  NABUFIT Denmark is a Danish company organized June 26, 2015 in Denmark.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value    The fair values of the Company's financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts at the reporting date.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations    The functional currency of NABUFIT Denmark  is the Danish Krone (DKK), while the functional currency of NABUFIT Global and the reporting currency is U.S. dollars (USD).  The Company translates the assets and liabilities of NABUFIT Denmark from the functional currency to U.S. dollars at the appropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet date. Equity balances are translated using historical exchange rates. Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in spot rates are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate during the period. 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency must first be re-measured from the applicable currency to the functional currency. The effect of this re-measurement process is recognized translation adjustments in our statement of comprehensive loss.

The Company had no foreign currency transaction gains or losses during the period from June 26, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2016.

Business Condition     The Company's Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 (File No. 333-210325) was declared effective on June 13, 2016, which Registration Statement registered for the offering and sale of up to 5,000,0000 shares of common stock at $1.75 per share.   On July 15, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of 1,504,050 shares of its common stock pursuant to subscription agreements dated on or about June 29, 2016.  The Shares were sold at a price of $0.92 per share and were offered pursuant to the Registration Statement.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an additional 613,664 shares of its common stock at $0.92 per share for $564,571 in cash ($235,200 has yet to be received) and 747,038 shares of its common stock at $0.92 per share for $687,275 in services.  The proceeds from this offering are expected to provide the liquidity necessary for the operations of the Company in the foreseeable future. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the success of that plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern (see Note 3 Going Concern). 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Cash and Cash Equivalents     The balance in cash and cash equivalents consists of cash reserves held in bank accounts. The Company maintains cash balances in bank accounts that, at times, exceed federally insured limits.  The Company has not experienced any losses in these accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk with respect to cash. 

Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, performance of the service has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Revenue is net of taxes and discounts and is recorded on an accrual basis.

Software Development Costs    The Company expenses software development costs until the Company has a working business model for the software.

Income Taxes    The Company accounts for income  taxes pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes.  We recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. 

All allowances against deferred income tax assets are recorded in whole or in part, when it is more likely than not those deferred income tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

A valuation allowance is required to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC 740 also requires reporting of taxes based on tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not standard and are measured at the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Differences between financial and tax reporting which do not meet this threshold are required to be recorded as unrecognized tax benefits.

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share    Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period giving effect to potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding.

New Accounting Pronouncements    The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.

NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,342,013 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and has an accumulated deficit of $2,714,409 as of September 30, 2016.  The Company also used cash in operating activities of $2,190,993 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In order for the Company to continue as a going concern, the Company expects to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing.  The Company is  regularly and continually seeking additional funding from investors and from time to time is in various stages of negotiations.  Nonetheless, to date the Company has not accomplished a financing of the size needed to put the Company on a stable operating basis.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing, that it will be able to attain positive cash flow operations, or that, if it is successful in any of those actions, those actions will produce adequate cash flow to enable it to meet our future obligations. All of our existing financing arrangements are short-term. If the Company is unable to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing, it may be required to significantly reduce or cease operations.

NOTE 4   MARKETING AGREEMENTS

The Company signs marketing agreements with professional trainers and athletes to help promote the Company's products and services.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a three-year marketing agreement with Neymar Jr, a professional soccer player out of Brazil.  Under the marketing agreement, the Company is required to pay 2,500,000 EUR in semiannual payments of 500,000 EUR (approximately $536,000) plus 2% royalty payments.  The Company also agreed to issue 418,825 shares to Neymar Jr. during the contract period.  The Company recorded the full amount of the agreement, including the issuance of shares, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company amortized $103,583 and had a remaining prepaid of approximately $3,100,000.

NOTE 5   LEASES

On December 1, 2015, the Company signed a new lease on their office in Fredericia Denmark, which replaced the prior lease and allowed the Company to move to larger office space (159 square meters) within the same building.  The new rent is DKK 13,184 per month ($1,975) and the security deposit increased to DKK 80,685 ($12,135).  The lease can be terminated with a six month notice, but not before December 1, 2017.  Rent will increase annually on January 1 based on the consumer price index, with a minimum increase of 2% per year.

Effective March 1, 2016, the Company signed Appendix 1 to the Fredericia lease agreement moving the office to a 190 square meter office located on the first floor of the building.  The rent and security deposit were not changed by the Appendix.  Once the Company utilizes the additional 31 square meters, the rent will increase proportionately.

NOTE 6    SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 

We have authorized capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock and 400,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock.

As of September 30, 2016, $279,371 was classified on the balance sheet as subscriptions receivable and $235,200 was classified as common stock subscribed.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition.  Our condensed financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.

Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements 

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "  may  ", "  should  ", "  expects  ", "  plans  ", "  anticipates  ", "  believes  ", "  estimates  ", "  predicts  ", "  potential  " or "  continue  " or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.   Such statements are based on currently available financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations.  Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements as such statements speak only as of the date on which they are made.   These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Such factors include, but are not limited to, market factors, market prices and marketing activity, future revenues and costs, unsettled political conditions, civil unrest and governmental actions, foreign currency fluctuations, and environmental and labor laws and other factors detailed herein and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") filings.    Additional factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include without limitation: 

our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms and conditions;

our ability to identify and acquire a viable operating business;

our ability to attract and retain management, and to integrate and maintain technical information and management information systems;

the intensity of competition; and

general economic conditions.

Forward-looking statements are predictions and not guarantees of future performance or events.  Forward-looking statements are based on current industry, financial and economic information, which we have assessed but which by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly abrupt changes.  Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business.  We hereby qualify all our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of their dates and should not be unduly relied upon.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise (other than pursuant to reporting obligations imposed on registrants pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)  to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Given the uncertainties that surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

Executive Summary

To date, the Company's focus has been on the development of its website portal and products.  The Company has had no income generated from operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Certain accounting policies are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements.  Their application requires significant management judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  A summary of critical accounting policies can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 ( No. 333-210325) .  For all of these policies, management cautions that future results rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require modification.

Results of Operations

The Company's consolidated operations include the operations of NABUFIT Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary NABUFIT Denmark for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from June 26, 2015 (effectively July 1, 2015) through September 30, 2015.  The Company's historical financial statements began with the inception of NABUFIT Denmark on June 26, 2015 (effectively July 1, 2015).

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,003,383 compared to a net loss of $109,213 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was mainly due to expenses related to the engagement of brand ambassadors, trainers and the talent acquisition of sports stars of $103,583 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the increase in the number of employees and general ramp up of the business.  The 2015 period was the first three months after the formation of the Company so operations were minimal.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $2,342,013 compared to a net loss of $109,213 for the period from inception (June 26, 2015) through September 30, 2015.  The increase was mainly due to expenses related to the engagement of brand ambassadors, professional trainers and sports stars of $103,583 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the increase in the number of employees and general ramp up of the business.  The 2015 period was only three months and the first three months after the formation of the Company so operations were minimal.

Operating expenses consist mainly of employee salaries and benefits, consulting fees related to the development of the app and website, costs related to the acquisition of brand ambassadors, professional trainers and sports stars, stock based compensation and professional fees.  We expect operating expenses to be at similar levels the rest of the year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since NABUFIT Denmark's inception in June 2015, it has incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $2,342,013. At September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,714,409.

At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $413,072. To date, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of NABUFIT Denmark's common stock and the sale of the Company's common stock. On October 8, 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately USD $1,795,000 (DKK 11.9 million) from the issuance of shares of NABUFIT Denmark's common stock.

The Company also issued 747,038 shares of its common stock at $0.92 per share for $687,275 in services pursuant to the Registration Statement. As of September 30, 2016, $279,371 was classified on the balance sheet as subscriptions receivable and $235,200 was classified as common stock subscribed.

We could potentially use our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect, and we may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, although we anticipate being able to obtain additional financing through non-dilutive means, we may be unable to do so. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section titled "Risk Factors" noted in the previously filed 10-K and in the Registration Statement  No. 333-210325  on Form S-1.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 ( No. 333-210325)  registering the public offering of up to 5,000,0000 additional shares of common stock at an offering price of $0.92 per share.  The proceeds from this offering are expected to provide the liquidity necessary for the foreseeable future.

Number of Employees

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 15 employees . 

Disclosure of Contractual Obligations

On September 1, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement with NR Sports/LX Sports Marketing relating to certain brand promotion and other services.  This agreement obligates the Company to provide payments of 2,500,000 EUR paid in 500,000 EUR increments every six months, additional guaranteed payments of up to 500,000 EUR, 2% of subscriptions, 2% of turnover and 50% of workouts purchased.  This contractual obligation could have a negative effect on the ability of the Company to achieve profitability and continue as a going concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

The Company had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

General

The Company's Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue, if any, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.

Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our President, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act."))  and based upon this evaluation, and the engagement of a qualified outside third party to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
