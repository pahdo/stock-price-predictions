  Notes 1- GENERAL  
   
  Business Overview   
 We design, build, and market clean energy products focused on energy efficiency and environmentally sustainable technologies and we perform electronics manufacturing services for third parties.  Our principal products are based upon the Clean Cycle    heat recovery system, offered by our wholly owned subsidiary Clean Energy HRS LLC.  Our Clean Cycle    captures waste heat from a variety of sources and turns it into electricity that users can use, store, or export, such as to an external or utility power grid.  The proven, cutting-edge Clean Cycle    technology allows commercial and industrial heat generators or sources to boost their overall energy efficiency with no additional fuel, no pollutants, and virtually no maintenance.  The engineering and manufacturing resources from our electronics manufacturing services business support our heat recovery solutions business.  We intend also to leverage these capabilities to identify and exploit other clean energy technologies and opportunities. 
 The Clean Cycle    heat recovery solution is an Organic Rankine Cycle, or ORC, system.  An ORC system is a closed-loop heat recovery steam generator system, sometimes referred to as an HRS or an HRSG, that utilizes heat from a heat source, such as an existing power generation system, to heat a fluid to produce steam.  The steam then passes through a turbine generator, and turbine generator converts the kinetic energy in the steam to produce electrical energy, which can be used, stored, or exported.  The ORC cycle then recycles and further cools the fluid medium to again use heat from the external heat source to continue the power-generation cycle.    
 The technology at the heart of the Clean Cycle    is a magnetic levitation bearing generator, which requires no oil or other lubricants and has no gear box.  The turbine generator and related power management electronics are what convert the kinetic energy in the steam cycle into electrical energy.  There are over 100 Clean Cycle    HRS units installed globally with more than one million fleet operating hours in diesel, gas, and biomass applications.   
 The magnetic levitation bearing generator technology was originally developed by Calnetix, Inc.  General Electric International, Inc. acquired the rights to the technology in certain applications from Calnetix in 2010.  In September 2015, our CE HRS subsidiary acquired General Electric   s rights to the technology in those applications, together with General Electric   s related HRS technology and improvements, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement with General Electric International, Inc. and General Electric Company that was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company   s Current Report on Form 8K dated September 11, 2015 and a concurrent Transaction Completion and Financing Agreement with ETI Partners IV, LLC.  CE HRS made an initial purchase price payment of $300,000 at closing and issued a three-year $1.2 million promissory note to GEII with respect to payment of the balance of the cash portion of the purchase price.  CE HRS also assumed certain liabilities of GEII related to the acquired assets.  In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into various ancillary agreements customary for asset acquisition transactions of this type.  Pursuant to the companion Transaction Completion and Financing Agreement facilitating our acquisition of the GE HRS assets, we issued 100,910,321 restricted shares of our common stock to ETI Partners IV, LLC (representing approximately 70% of the post-acquisition outstanding common stock).  Concurrently, we entered into a Loan, Guarantee, and Collateral Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with ETI Partners IV, LLC to provide a framework for further financing in the Company.   
 Pursuant to our license agreement with Calnetix (which General Electric assigned to us in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement), we market and sell our Clean Cycle    products world-wide to ORC-based application where heat is sourced from reciprocating combustion engines, of any type (other than those employed on transiting marine vessels), gas or steam turbine systems used for power generation, and biomass boiler systems.  Our rights in these applications are exclusive.  We also market our Clean Cycle    products world-wide on a non-exclusive basis in the following applications, whether or not ORC-based:  reciprocating combustion engines, of any type (except those employed on transiting marine vessels or in the automotive application for cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles); gas or steam turbine systems with an ISO rated power  

Page 11 of 35 
 output above one megawatt (1 MW); and applications that use biomass as a source of heat.  We have also periodically negotiated to obtain additional non-exclusive marketing rights to the technology from Calnetix as commercial opportunities have arisen that are not in conflict with other licensees of Calnetix.    
 Our growth strategy is to scale up our business by focusing on the significant installed base of power generation and biomass boiler systems ideally suited to ORC-based heat recovery systems, exploiting market segments and regions where there are significantly high electricity prices, and identifying and exploiting incentive markets as they are available.  We sell equipment and complete heat recovery systems globally directly to end customers and also through distributors.  We also commercialize our heat recovery systems through lease and energy-based programs where appropriate.   We are also developing technology co-ventures with owners of compatible power generation technology to develop integrated energy production systems to exploit additional potential customers.  
 The GE HRS asset acquisition and related financing transactions resulted in a change of control of the Company according to FASB No. 2014-17 Business Combinations (Topic 805).  As a result, the transactions qualify as a business combination.  In accordance with Topic 805, the Company elected to apply pushdown accounting, using the valuation date of September 30, 2015.  As a result we recognized $747,976 in goodwill. 

Following completion of the acquisition and integration of the GE HRS into our business, on November 13, 2015 we changed our name to    Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.    to better reflect the focus of our new business and business strategies.  
 Previously, in March 2013, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Trident Manufacturing, Inc., a Utah corporation engaged in electronics manufacturing services focused on industrial, aerospace, military, instrumentation, and medical markets, in exchange for 1,600,000 restricted shares of our common stock.  As of the Trident acquisition, we recognized $420,673 in goodwill.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we impaired the goodwill in the amount of $420,673.

  Going Concern  
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder   s deficit of $2,269,746 and a working capital deficit of $3,034,231 as of September 30, 2016. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $6,087,415 as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach a profitable operating stand and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations. 
  Plan of Operation  
 Management is taking the following steps to sustain profitability and growth: (i) pursuing increased sales through existing global distribution channels and utilization of direct sales; (ii) pursuing lease and energy-based contracts with customers, including targeted island or isolated locations where the economics, energy production, and emissions reduction profiles are attractive; (iii) pursuing stable and higher-margin electronics manufacturing services contracts where the terms are favorable to the Company; (iv) arranging financing partnerships and relationships to facilitate increased lease and energy-based commercialization of our HRS products; (v) leveraging core competencies to acquire or integrate other technologies and entertain equity opportunities; and (vi) pursuing licenses of our patented technology and proprietary processes and developing cogeneration and OEM opportunities. 
 Our future success is likely dependent on our ability to sustain profitable growth and attain additional capital to support growth. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any such financing, or that it will be able to generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations.  The successful outcome of these or any future activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute its business plans. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.    
  Our Products and Services   
 Our main product, the Clean Cycle    HRS system, converts heat from variety of heat sources into clean, affordable electricity. Our heat recovery solution system generates electricity from heat with zero additional fuel required, zero additional emissions produced, and low maintenance.  The Clean Cycle    HRS system is also re-deployable with continuous 24x7 operation. 
  Sales and Marketing   
 Our marketing approach is to position the Company, our products and our services under our new    Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.    and    CETY    identity and brand.  We intend to market our Heat Recovery Solutions products specifically using the market-recognized Clean Cycle    brand name.  We also intend to utilize our relationships to identify new market segments and regions in which we can expand the commercialization of our products.  We intend to offer our products for sale and also to commercialize them under leases, energy-based contracts and other financing structures to accelerate customer adoption and increase market penetration.  We also intend to explore licensing opportunities for our patented and other proprietary technologies. We utilize both direct sales force and global distributors with expertise in clean energy.  
  Corporate Information   
 We were originally incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc.  We reincorporated in Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc.  In November 2015, following our acquisition of heat recovery solutions assets from General Electric, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.  Our principal executive offices are located at 2990 Redhill Avenue, Costa Mesa, CA 92626.  Our telephone number is (949) 273-4990.

  NOTE 2     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  
 The summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (formerly Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company's financial statements.  The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company   s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. 
 The Company follows the accounting guidance outlined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification guidelines.  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10Q.  They may not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company   s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10K.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, which unless otherwise disclosed herein, consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
  Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
 We maintain the majority of our cash accounts at a commercial bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (   FDIC   ) up to $250,000 per commercial bank. For purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents. 
  Accounts Receivable  
 We grant credit to our customers located within the United States of America; and do not require collateral. Our ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us.  Reserves for un-collectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts.  Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts of $7,000.  Five (5) customers accounted for approximately 93% of accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and one customer accounted for 28% and no other customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables.  Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant. 
  Inventory  
 Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional  

Page 14 of 35 
 provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a reserve for potentially obsolete inventory of $250,000.   
  Property and Equipment   
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets.  The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets: 
   
                 Furniture and fixtures                                                          3 to 7 years 
                 Equipment                                                                           7 to 10 years 
  Long    Lived Assets  
 Our management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of long lived assets over their remaining lives can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of long-lived asset impairment if any, is measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which long-lived assets impairment is determined by management. There can be no assurance however, that market conditions will not change or demand for our services will continue, which could result in impairment of long-lived assets in the future. 
  Revenue Recognition  
 Revenue from product and services are recognized at the time goods are shipped or services are provided to the customer, with an appropriate provision for returns and allowances. Terms are generally FOB origination with the right of inspection and acceptance. We have not experienced a material amount of rejected or damaged product. 
 The Company provides services for its customers that range from contract design to original product design to repair services. The Company recognizes service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  
  Other Comprehensive Income  
 We have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. 
  Net Profit (Loss) per Common Share     
    Basic profit / (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding common shares of 143,478,083 used in the calculation of basic earnings per share.  Basic Weighted average common shares and equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 140,347,605 and 32,667,452 respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 750,000 additional common shares and options to purchase 2,625,122 additional common shares. Fully diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were 143,794,838 and 32,847,574 for the same period in 2015, however were withheld from the calculation, as they were considered anti-dilutive.  
  Research and Development  
 Research and development costs incurred in association with the alternative fuels technology development (which include salaries and equipment) were expensed as incurred.  We had no amounts of research and development R D during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
  Segment Disclosure        
 FASB Codification Topic 280,  Segment Reporting , establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise   s reportable segments.   The Company has   two   reportable     

Page 15 of 35 
 segments: Clean Energy HRS(HRS) and the legacy electronic manufacturing services division. The segments are determined based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. Refer to note 1 for a description of the various product categories manufactured under each of these segments. Prior to March 31, 2016 we only had one reporting segment. 
 An operating segment's performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net. 
  Selected Financial Data : 

Share-Based Compensation     
 The Company has adopted the use of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,    Share-Based Payment    (SFAS No. 123R) (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation ), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,    Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,    and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use Opinion 25   s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The  

Page 16 of 35 
 Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility; however, due to the thinly traded nature of our stock, we have chosen to use an average of the annual volatility of like companies in our industry. For the    risk-free interest rate,    we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90-day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the Company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20-trading-day average. At the time of grant, the share-based compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly.  It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares.  The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates.  
 We re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award   the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we had $101,347 and $73,450 respectively, in share based expense, due to the issuance of common stock.  As of September 30, 2016 we had no further non-vested expense to be recognized.   
  Income Taxes  
 The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109 (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes), which requires the asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when differences are expected to reverse. As of September 30, 2016, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(6,087,415) and a deferred tax asset of approximately $2,069,721 using the statutory rate of 34%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years.  However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked valuation allowance of $(2,069,721).  FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  At September 30, 2016 the Company had not taken any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740. 

On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a Transaction Completion and Financing Agreement  with ETI Partners IV LLC, and Company agreed to issue to ETI 100,910,321 shares of restricted common stock, representing 70% of the fully diluted common stock of the Company.  This resulted in a change in control.  We are in the process of analyzing the effect on the deferred tax asset and the numbers above may change as a result, however the Deferred Tax Asset (net) will remain unchanged. 
 We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the states of California and Utah. Further, the Company currently has no open tax years    subject to audit prior to December 31, 2013.  The Company is current on its federal and state tax returns.

As a result of the acquisition, Trident has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result, we recognized $420,673 in goodwill.  On January 2, 2016 we closed the Trident facility in Utah and as for the year ended December 31, 2015 we booked an impairment of the goodwill in the amount of $420,673.

Accordingly, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the plan.

 repurchases of Company common stock to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The timing and number of any shares repurchased will depend on the terms and conditions of the plan and no assurance can be given that any specific amount of common stock will be repurchased.

  Common Stock    
 Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of September 30, 2016 there were 143,478,083 shares of common stock outstanding.  All outstanding shares of common stock are, and the common stock to be issued will be, fully paid and non-assessable.  Each share of our common stock has identical rights and privileges in every respect. The holders of our common stock are entitled to vote upon all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. There are no cumulative voting rights.  
 The holders of our common stock are entitled to share equally in dividends and other distributions that our Board of Directors may declare from time to time out of funds legally available for that purpose, if any, after the satisfaction of any prior rights and preferences of any outstanding preferred stock. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of common stock shares will be entitled to share ratably in the distribution of all of our assets remaining available for distribution after satisfaction of all our liabilities and our obligations to holders of our outstanding preferred stock. 
  Preferred Stock  
 Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.  Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and fix for each series, the designation of and number of shares to be included in each such series. Our Board of Directors is also authorized to set the powers, privileges, preferences, and relative participating, optional or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each such series. 
 Unless our Board of Directors provides otherwise, the shares of all series of preferred stock will rank on parity with respect to the payment of dividends and to the distribution of assets upon liquidation. Any issuance by us of shares of our preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of our control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. 
 We previously authorized 440 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 20,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and 15,000 shares Series C Convertible Preferred Stock.  As of August 20, 2006, all series A, B, and C preferred had been converted into common stock.  
 Effective August 7, 2013, our Board of Directors designated a series of our preferred stock as Series D Preferred Stock, authorizing 15,000 shares.  Our Series D Preferred Stock offering terms authorized us to raise up to $1,000,000 with an over-allotment of $500,000 in multiple closings over the course of six months.  We received an aggregate of $750,000 in financing in subscription for Series D Preferred Stock, or 7,500 shares.   
 The following are primary terms of the Series D Preferred Stock.  The Series D Preferred holders were initially entitled to be paid a special monthly divided at the rate of 17.5% per annum.  Initially, the Series D Preferred Stock was also entitled to be paid special dividends in the event cash dividends were not paid when scheduled.  If the Company does not pay the dividend within five (5) business days from the end of the calendar month for which the payment of such dividend to owed, the Company will pay the investor a special dividend of an additional 3.5%. Any unpaid or accrued special dividends will be paid upon a liquidation or redemption.  For any other dividends or distributions, the Series D Preferred Stock participates with common stock on an as-converted basis.  The Series D Preferred holders may elect to convert the Series D Preferred Stock, in their sole discretion, at any time after a one year (1) year holding period, by sending the Company a notice to convert.  The conversion rate is equal to the greater of $0.08 or a 20% discount to the average of the three (3) lowest closing market prices of the common stock during the ten (10) trading day period prior to conversion.  The Series D Preferred Stock is redeemable from funds legally available for distribution at the option of the individual holders of the Series D Preferred Stock commencing any time after the one (1) year period from the offering closing at a price equal to the initial purchase price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, provided, that if the Company gave notice to the investors that it was not in a financial position to redeem the Series D Preferred, the Company and the Series D Preferred holders are obligated to negotiate in good faith for an extension of the redemption period.  The Company timely notified the investors that it was not in a financial position to redeem the Series D Preferred and the Company and the investors have engaged  

Page 25 of 35 
 in ongoing negotiations to determine an appropriate extension period.  The Company may elect to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock any time at a price equal to initial purchase price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, subject to the investors    right to convert, by providing written notice about its intent to redeem.  Each investor has the right to convert the Series D Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to such redemption by the Company.

 On August 21, 2014, a holder holding 5,000 shares of Preferred Series D Preferred agreed to lower the dividend rate to 13% on its Series D Preferred.  In September 2015, all holders of Series D Preferred signed and delivered estoppel agreements, whereby the holders agreed, among other things, that the Series D Preferred was not in default and to reduce (effective as of September 30, 2015) the dividend rate on the Series D Preferred Stock to six percent per annum and to terminate the 3.5% penalty in respect of unpaid dividends accruing on or after such date. 
   Warrants   
   Series E     Common stock warrants

  Item 2. Management   s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (unaudited)  
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking statements.  You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms or other variations on these words or comparable terminology.  These statements are only present statements about possible future events and are not predictions.  In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, including the Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 3015 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although we believe that the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.  Except as required by applicable laws, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. 
   OVERVIEW    
  Going Concern  
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder   s deficit of $2,269,746 and a working capital deficit of $3,034,231 as of September 30, 2016. The Company also had an accumulated deficit of $6,087,415 as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach a profitable operating stand and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations. 
   
  Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the same periods in 2015.  
   Net Sales     
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue was $280,299 compared to $235,838 for the same period in 2015.  Our revenue increased by $44,461 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to the shut down and relocation of our facility in the third quarter of 2015.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue was $1,687,656 compared to $1,848,854 for the same period in 2015.  Our revenue decreased by $161,198 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Our revenue decrease was mainly due to the relocation of our operating facility and the corresponding shut down in operations from April through June, 2016.   
  Major Customers  
 Our top five customers accounted for approximately 98% of our net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 85%, for the same period in 2015. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 80% of our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 81%, for the same period in 2015. 
 We believe that our ability to grow our core business depends on increasing sales to existing customers, and on successfully attracting new customers. Customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be  

Page 29 of 35 
 changed or delayed based on our customer   s performance and the end users    markets they serve which we have no control over. The timely replacement of delayed, canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be ensured.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Capital Requirements for long-term Obligations   

Critical Accounting Policies    
  Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense  s during the reporting periods.  
  We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.  
   Future Financing   
  We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares and the issuance of debt securities or establishment of other credit facilities to continue to fund our business operations.  Issuances of additional shares or securities convertible or exchangeable for shares may result in dilution to existing stockholders.  There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our business operations.  
  Off-balance Sheet Arrangement  
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.

  Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange Act   ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC   s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the fact that none of our present directors qualifies as a    financial expert    as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements.  Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (as filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016) for a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures. 
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and have added four independent members to our Board of Directors, there have been no other significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.  
 The Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

rights granted under this Agreement.  Upon the written request of Investments and/or Buyer made within thirty (30) days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by Investments and/or Buyer and the intended method of disposition thereof), the Company shall, at its sole cost and expense, use its best efforts to effect the registration of all Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by Investments and/or Buyer, to the extent requisite to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods of disposition) of the Registrable Securities by Investments and/or Buyer, by inclusion of such Registrable Securities in the Registration Statement which covers the securities which the Company proposes to register; provided, that if the Company is unable to register the full amount of Registrable Securities in an    at the market offering    under SEC rules and regulations due to the high percentage of the Company   s Common Stock the Registrable Securities represents (giving effect to all other securities being registered in the Registration Statement), then the Company may reduce, on a pro rata basis, the amount of Registrable Securities subject to the Registration Statement to a lesser amount which equals the maximum number of Registrable Securities that the Company is permitted to register in an    at the market offering   and provided, further, that if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any Registrable Securities and prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason either not to register or to delay registration of such Registrable Securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to Investments and/or the Buyer and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the expenses of registration in connection therewith), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering such Registrable Securities, shall be permitted to delay registering any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities.  If Buyer shall have transferred all or part of its Registrable Securities, then for purposes of this Section, the term    Buyer    shall reference Buyer and/or such transferee(s).   
   
 d.  Securities Filings.   The Company undertakes and agrees to make all necessary filings (including, without limitation, a Form D) in connection with the sale of the Securities to the Buyer required under any United States laws and regulations applicable to the Company (including without limitation state    blue sky    laws), or by any domestic securities exchange or trading market, and to provide a copy thereof to the Buyer promptly after such filing. 
   
 e.  Reporting Status; Public Trading Market; DTC Eligibility.   So long as the Buyer and/or Investments beneficially own any Securities, (i) the Company shall timely file, prior to or on the date when due, all reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the Company had securities registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act; (ii) the Company shall not be operated as, or report, to the SEC or any other Person, that the Company is a    shell company    or indicate to the contrary to the SEC or any other Person; (iii) the Company shall take all other action under its control necessary to ensure the availability of Rule 144 under the 1933 Act for the sale of Shares by the Buyer at the earliest possible date; and (iv) the Company shall at all times while any Securities are outstanding maintain its engagement of an independent registered public

If, so long as the Buyer and/or Investments beneficially own any of the Securities, the Company receives any written notice from the OTCM, FINRA, or the SEC with respect to either any alleged deficiency in the Company   s compliance with applicable rules and regulations (including without limitation any comments from the SEC on any of the Company   s documents filed (or the failure to have made any such filing) under the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act) (each, a    Regulatory Notice   ), then the Company shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) business days, provide copies of the Regulatory Notice to the Buyer, and shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) business days of receipt of the Regulatory Notice (a    Regulatory Response   ), respond in writing to the OTCM, FIRNA and/or SEC (as the case may be), setting forth the Company   s explanation and/or response to the issues raised in the Regulatory Notice, with a view towards maintaining and/or regaining full compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the OTCM, FIRNA and/or SEC and maintaining or regaining good standing of the Company with the OTCM, FINRA and/or SEC, as the case may be, the intent being to ensure that the Company maintain its reporting company status with the SEC and that its Common Stock be and remain available for trading on the OTCQB or OTCQX (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the bottom-tier OTC Pink (or,    pink sheets   ).  Further, at all times while any Securities are outstanding, the Common Stock shall be DWAC Operational, and the Common Stock shall not be subject to any DTC    chill    designation or similar restriction on the clearing of the Common Stock through DTC.   
   
 f.  Use of Proceeds.    The Company shall use the proceeds from the sale of the Debentures for working capital purposes only and will be subject to customary restrictions.

 g.  Available Shares.   Commencing on the date of execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall have and maintain authorized and reserved for issuance, free from preemptive rights, that number of shares equal to Five Hundred percent (500%) of the number of shares of Common Stock (1) issuable based upon the conversion of the then-outstanding Debentures (including accrued interest thereon) as may be required to satisfy the conversion rights of the Buyer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Debenture (without giving effect to the 4.99% limitation on ownership or One Hundred Eighty (180) day delay in  

14 

convertibility, as set forth in the Debentures),  provided, however  that for purposes of the foregoing calculation, the full indebtedness under the Debentures shall be deemed immediately convertible and (2) issuable to the Buyer on future Closing Dates, based upon the lowest closing bid price per share of the Common Stock on the date before the most recent Closing Date (as reported by Bloomberg LP). The Company shall monitor its compliance with the foregoing requirements on an ongoing basis.  If at any time the Company does not have available an amount of authorized and non-issued Shares required to be reserved pursuant to this Section, then the Company shall, without notice or demand by the Buyer, call within thirty (30) days of such occurrence and hold within sixty (60) days of such occurrence a special meeting of shareholders, for the sole purpose of increasing the number of shares authorized.  Management of the Company shall recommend to shareholders to vote in favor of increasing the number of Common Stock authorized at the meeting.  Members of the Company   s management shall also vote all of their own shares in favor of increasing the number of Common Stock authorized at the meeting.  If the increase in authorized shares is approved by the stockholders at the meeting, the Company shall implement the increase in authorized shares within one (1) business day following approval at such meeting.  Alternatively, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in lieu of calling and holding a meeting as described above, the Company may, within thirty (30) days of the date when the Company does not have available an amount of authorized and non-issued Shares required to be reserved as described above, procure the written consent of stockholders to increase the number of shares authorized, and provide the stockholders with notice thereof as may be required under applicable law (including without limitation Section 14(c) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 14C thereunder).  Upon obtaining stockholder approval as aforesaid, the Company shall cause the appropriate increase in its authorized shares of Common Stock within one (1) business day (or as soon thereafter as permitted by applicable law). Company   s failure to comply with these provisions will be an Event of Default (as defined in the Debentures).  
   
 h.  Reimbursement.   If (i) Buyer and/or Investments becomes a party defendant in any capacity in any action or proceeding brought by any stockholder of the Company, in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, or if the Buyer and/or Investments is impleaded in any such action, proceeding or investigation by any Person, or (ii) the Buyer and/or Investments, other than by reason of its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of law (as adjudicated by a court of law having proper jurisdiction and such adjudication is not subject to appeal), becomes a party defendant in any capacity in any action or proceeding brought by the SEC against or involving the Company or in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, or if the Buyer or Investments is impleaded in any such action, proceeding or investigation by any Person, then in any such case, the Company shall promptly reimburse the Buyer and/or Investments for its or their reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith. The reimbursement obligations of the Company under this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to any affiliates of the Buyer and/or Investments who are actually named in such action, proceeding or investigation, and partners, directors, agents, employees and controlling Persons (if any), as the case may be, of the Buyer, Investments and any such Affiliate, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and  

personal representatives of the Company, the Buyer, Investments and any such Affiliate and any such Person.  Except as otherwise set forth in the Transaction Documents, the Company also agrees that neither any Buyer, Investments nor any such Affiliate, partners, directors, agents, employees or controlling Persons shall have any liability to the Company or any Person asserting claims on behalf of or in right of the Company in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the Transaction Documents. 
   
 i. The Company shall provide the Transfer Agent and/or the Buyer, Investments or their respective brokerage and/or clearing firm with all relevant legal opinions and other documentation requested by the Buyer or Investments in connection with the issuance of the Conversion Shares or the Restricted Stock, or the sale thereof, to confirm the share issuance(s) such that the Conversion Shares and/or Restricted Stock may be deposited with the applicable brokerage and/or clearing firm. 
 j.  No Payments to Affiliates or Related Parties.   So long as any of the Debentures remain outstanding, if the Debentures are in default, the Company shall not, absent the prior written consent of the holders of all Debentures then outstanding, make any payments to any of the Company   s or the Subsidiaries    respective affiliates or related parties, including without limitation payments or prepayments of principal or interest accrued on any indebtedness or obligation in favor of affiliates or related parties.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of this Section 4(j) shall not apply to payments to the Subsidiaries, or other businesses in which affiliates have an interest, made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice as disclosed in the SEC Documents. 
   
 k.  Notice of Material Adverse Effect.   The Company shall notify the Buyer (and any subsequent holder of the Debentures), as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) business days of the Company   s knowledge of any Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  For purposes of the foregoing,    knowledge    means the earlier of the Company   s actual knowledge or the Company   s constructive knowledge upon due inquiry. 
   
 l.  Public Disclosure.   Except to the extent required by applicable law, absent the Buyer   s prior written consent, the Company shall not reference the name of the Buyer in any press release, securities disclosure, business plan, marketing or funding proposal. 
   
 m.  Nature of Transaction; Savings Clause.   It is the parties    express understanding and agreement that the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents constitute an investment and not a loan.  If nonetheless such transactions are deemed to be a loan (as adjudicated by a court of law having proper jurisdiction and such adjudication is not subject to appeal), the Company shall not be obligated or required to pay interest at a rate that could subject Buyer to either civil or criminal liability as a result of such rate exceeding the maximum rate that the Buyer is permitted to charge under applicable law, and the Company   s obligations under the Transaction Documents shall not be void or voidable on the basis of the Buyer   s lack of any license or registration as a lender with any governmental authority.   It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that neither the amounts payable pursuant to Section 12, any redemption premium, remedy upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Debentures) or any Acceleration Amount (as defined in the Debentures), original issue discount nor any investment returns of the Buyer on the sale of the Debentures or the sale of any Conversion  

16 

Shares (whether unrealized or realized) shall be construed as interest.  If, by the terms of the Debentures, any other Transaction Document or any other instrument, Buyer is at any time required or obligated to pay interest at a rate exceeding such maximum rate, interest payable under the Debenture and/or such other Transaction Documents or other instrument shall be computed (or recomputed) at such maximum rate, and the portion of all prior interest payments (if any) exceeding such maximum shall be applied to payment of the outstanding principal of the Debentures.   
   
 4.  TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS.  
   
 a.  Transfer Agent Instruction Letter.   On or before the Signing Closing Date, the Company shall irrevocably instruct its Transfer Agent in writing using the letter substantially in the form of  Exhibit B  annexed hereto, with only such modifications as the Buyer agrees to, executed by the Company, the Buyer and the Transfer Agent (the    Transfer Agent Instruction Letter   ), to (i) reserve that number of shares of Common Stock as is required under Section 4(g) hereof, and (ii) issue Common Stock from time to time upon conversion of the Debentures in such amounts as specified from time to time by the Buyer to the Transfer Agent in a Notice of Conversion, in such denominations to be specified by the Buyer in connection with each conversion of the Debentures.   The Transfer Agent shall not be restricted from issuing shares from only the allotment reserved hereunder for the Conversion Amount (as defined in the Debentures), but instead may, to the extent necessary to satisfy the amount of shares issuable upon conversion, issue shares above and beyond the amount reserved on account of the Conversion Amount, without any additional instructions or authorization from the Company, and the Company shall not provide the Transfer Agent with any instructions or documentation contrary to the foregoing.  As of the date of this Agreement, the Transfer Agent is Colonial Stock Transfer Company, Inc.  The Company shall at all times while any Debentures are outstanding engage a Transfer Agent which is a party to the Transfer Agent Instruction Letter.  The Company shall not terminate the Transfer Agent or otherwise change Transfer Agents without at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the Buyer and with the Buyer   s prior written consent to such change, which the Buyer may grant or withhold in its sole discretion.  The Company shall continuously monitor its compliance with the share reservation requirements and, if and to the extent necessary to increase the number of reserved shares to remain and be at least Five Hundred percent (500%) of the Conversion Amount to account for any decrease in the Market Price of the Common Stock, the Company shall immediately (and in any event within two (2) business days) notify the Transfer Agent in writing of the reservation of such additional shares,  provided  that in the event that the number of shares reserved for conversion of the Debentures is less than Five Hundred percent (500%) of the Conversion Amount, the Buyer may also directly instruct the Transfer Agent to increase the reserved shares as necessary to satisfy the minimum reserved share requirement, and the Transfer Agent shall act accordingly,  provided, further,  that the Company shall within two (2) business days provide any written confirmation, assent or documentation thereof as the Transfer Agent may request to act upon a share increase instruction delivered by the Buyer.  The Company shall provide the Buyer with a copy of all written instructions to the Company   s Transfer Agent with respect to the reservation of shares simultaneously with the issuance of such instructions to the Transfer Agent.  The Company covenants that no instruction other than such instructions referred to in this Section 5 and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 4(a) hereof prior to registration and sale of the  

Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act will be given by the Company to the Transfer Agent and that the Conversion Shares shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and applicable law.  If the Buyer provides the Company and/or the Transfer Agent with an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that registration of a resale by the Buyer of any of the Securities in accordance with clause (1)(B) of Section 4(a) of this Agreement is not required under the 1933 Act, the Company shall (except as provided in clause (2) of Section 4(a) of this Agreement) permit the de-legending or transfer of the Securities and, in the case of the Conversion Shares, instruct the Company   s Transfer Agent to issue one or more certificates for Common Stock without legend in such name and in such denominations as specified by the Buyer.   
 b.  Conversion.   (i) The Company shall permit the Buyer to exercise the right to convert the Debentures by faxing, emailing or delivering overnight an executed and completed Notice of Conversion to the Company or the Transfer Agent.  If so requested by the Buyer or the Transfer Agent, the Company shall within one (1) business day respond with its endorsement so as to confirm the outstanding principal amount of any Debenture submitted for conversion or shall reconcile any difference with the Buyer promptly after receiving such Notice of Conversion. 
   
 (i) The term    Conversion Date    means, with respect to any conversion elected by the holder of the Debentures, the date specified in the Notice of Conversion, provided the copy of the Notice of Conversion is given either via mail or facsimile to or otherwise delivered to the Transfer Agent and/or the Company in accordance with the provisions hereof so that it is received by the Transfer Agent and/or the Company on or before such specified date.  
   
 (i) The Company shall deliver (or will cause the Transfer Agent to deliver) the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion (i) if the Company is then DWAC Operational, in electronic form by DWAC pursuant to the Buyer   s instructions, or (ii) if the Company is not then DWAC Operational, then in certificated form to the Buyer at the address specified in the Notice of Conversion (which may be the Buyer   s address for notices as contemplated by Section 10 hereof or a different address) via express courier, by electronic transfer or otherwise, within two (2) business days (the    Delivery Date   ) after (A) the business day on which the Buyer delivered the Notice of Conversion to the Company or Transfer Agent (by facsimile, email or other delivery) or (B) the date on which payment of interest and principal on the Debentures, which the Company has elected to pay by the issuance of Common Stock, as contemplated by the Debentures, was due, as the case may be. 
   
 a.  Failure to Timely Issue Conversion Shares or De-Legended Shares.     The Company   s failure to issue and deliver Conversion Shares to the Buyer (either by DWAC or in certificated form, as required by Section 5(b)) on or before the Delivery Date shall be considered an Event of Default, which shall entitle the Buyer to certain remedies set forth in the Debentures and provided by applicable law .   Similarly, the Company   s failure to issue and deliver Common Stock in unrestricted form without a restrictive legend when required under the Transaction Documents shall entitle the Buyer to damages for the diminution in value (if any) of the relevant shares between the date delivery was due versus the date ultimately delivered in unrestricted form.  The Company acknowledges that its failure to timely honor a Notice of Conversion (or the occurrence of any other Event of Default) shall cause definable financial hardship on the  

18 

Buyer(s) and that the remedies set forth herein and in the Debentures are reasonable and appropriate.  
   
 b.  Duties of Company; Authorization.   The Company shall inform the Transfer Agent of the reservation of shares contemplated by Section 4(g) and this Section 5, and shall keep current in its payment obligations to the Transfer Agent such that the Transfer Agent will continue to process share transfers and the initial issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Debentures.  The Company hereby authorizes and agrees to authorize the Transfer Agent to correspond and otherwise communicate with the Buyer or their representatives in connection with the foregoing and other matters related to the Common Stock.  Further, the Company hereby authorizes the Buyer or its representative to provide instructions to the Transfer Agent that are consistent with the foregoing and instructs the Transfer Agent to honor any such instructions.  Should the Company fail for any reason to keep current in its payment obligations to the Transfer Agent, the Buyer and/or Investments may pay such amounts as are necessary to compensate the Transfer Agent for performing its duties with respect to share reservation, issuance of Conversion Shares and/or de-legending certificates representing Restricted Stock, and all amounts so paid shall be promptly reimbursed by the Company.  If not so reimbursed within thirty (30) days, such amounts shall, at the option of the Buyer and without prior notice to or consent of the Company, be added to the principal amount due under the Debenture(s) held by the Buyer, whereupon interest will begin to accrue on such amounts at the rate specified in the Debentures. 
   
 c.  Effect of Bankruptcy.   The Buyer shall be entitled to exercise its conversion privilege with respect to the Debentures notwithstanding the commencement of any case under 11 U.S.C.  101  et seq.  (the    Bankruptcy Code   ).  In the event the Company is a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted, any rights to relief it may have under 11 U.S.C.  362 in respect of the Buyer   s conversion privilege.  The Company hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted, any rights to relief it may have under 11 U.S.C.  362 in respect of the conversion of the Debentures.  The Company agrees, without cost or expense to the Buyer, to take or to consent to any and all action necessary to effectuate relief under 11 U.S.C.  362.

  a) 
 Investment     Purpose.  Purchaser     is     acquiring     the     Securities     for     its  own 
 account  and  not  with  a  view  towards,    or  for  resale  in  connection  with,  the  public  sale  or 
 distribution thereof in    violation of applicable    securities    laws; provided,    however,    by    making    the 
 representations    herein,    Purchaser    does    not    agree,    or    make    any    representation    or    warranty,    to 
 hold    any    of    the    Securities    for    any    minimum    or    other    specific    term    and    reserves    the    right    to

 or an exemption under    the    1933    Act.     The    Purchaser    is acquiring    the Securities    hereunder    in the 
 ordinary  course  of  its  business.     The  Purchaser     does  not  presently  have  any  agreement  or 
 understanding,  directly    or  indirectly,  with  any  person    to  distribute  any    of    the  Securities  in 
 violation of applicable securities laws. 
  b) 
 Accredited    Investor    Status.    The    Purchaser    is    an       accredited    investor       as 
    that term is defined      in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D (an    Accredited Investor   ).  
  c) 
 Reliance on Exemptions. The Purchaser understands that the Securities are 
 being     offered     and     sold     to     it     in     reliance     upon     specific     exemptions     from     the     registration 
 requirements    of United    States    federal    and    state    securities    laws    and    that    the    Company    is    relying 
 upon  the  truth  and  accuracy  of,  and  the  Purchaser   s  compliance  with,  the  representations, 
 warranties,    agreements,    acknowledgments    and    understandings    of    the    Purchaser    set    forth    herein 
 in    order    to    determine    the    availability    of    such    exemptions    and    the    eligibility    of    the    Purchaser    to 
 acquire the Securities. 
  d) 
 Information.    The    Purchaser    and    its    advisors,    if    any,    have    been,    and    for    so 
 long  as  the  Securities  remain  outstanding  will  continue  to  be,  furnished  with  all  materials 
 relating    to    the    business,    finances    and    operations    of    the    Company    and    materials    relating    to    the 
 offer    and    sale    of    the    Securities    which    have    been    reasonably    requested    by    the    Purchaser    or    its 
 advisors, provided    that    the Purchaser    has not    been    furnished with, and    the Company shall not    in 
 the  future    deliver    to    the    Purchaser    without  its    consent,    any    material    non-public  information 
 concerning    the    Company.    The    Purchaser    and    its    advisors,    if    any,    have    been,    and    for    so    long    as 
 the    Securities    remain    outstanding    will    continue    to    be,    afforded    the    opportunity to    ask    questions 
 of the    Company.    Neither    such    inquiries    nor    any    other    due    diligence    investigation    conducted    by 
 Purchaser    or    any    of    its    advisors    or    representatives    shall    modify,    amend    or    affect    Purchaser   s 
    right      to      rely    on      the      Company   s      representations      and      warranties      contained      in      Section      3      below.

 risk.

 federal    or    state    agency    or    any    other    government    or    governmental    agency    has    passed    upon    or 
 made any   recommendation or endorsement of the Securities. 
  f) 
 Transfer    or    Re-sale.    The    Purchaser    understands    that    (i)    the    sale    or    re-sale 
 of the    Securities    has    not    been    and    is    not    being    registered    under    the    1933    Act    or    any    applicable 
 state    securities    laws,    and    the    Securities    may    not    be    transferred    unless    (a)    the    Securities    are    sold

 delivered    to    the    Company    an    opinion    of    counsel    that    shall    be  in    form,    substance    and    scope 
 customary    for    opinions    of counsel    in    comparable    transactions    to    the    effect    that    the    securities    to 
 be     sold     or     transferred     may     be     sold     or     transferred     pursuant     to     an     exemption     from     such 
 registration, which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,    (c) the Securities are 
    sold      or      transferred      to      an         affiliate         (as defined      in      Rule      144      promulgated      under      the      1933      Act      (or  
    a      successor      rule)      (   Rule      144   )      of      the      Purchaser      who      agrees      to      sell    or      otherwise      transfer      the

 Regulation S; (ii) any sale of such Securities made    in reliance on Rule 144    may be made only in

 made)    may be deemed to be an underwriter (as that term is defined    in the 1933 Act) may require 
 compliance    with    some    other    exemption    under    the    1933    Act    or    the    rules    and    regulations    of    the 
 SEC    thereunder;    and    (iii)    neither    the    Company    nor    any    other    person    is    under    any    obligation    to 
 register    such    Securities    under    the    1933    Act    or    any    state    securities    laws    or    to    comply    with    the 
 terms     and     conditions     of     any     exemption     thereunder     (in     each     case).     Notwithstanding     the 
 foregoing    or    anything    else    contained    herein    to    the    contrary,    the    Securities    may    be    pledged    as

 (corporate and    other) to    own,    lease, use and operate    its properties and to    carry on its business as 
 and    where    now    owned,    leased,    used,    operated    and    conducted.    Schedule    3(a)    sets    forth    a    list    of 
 all    of    the    Subsidiaries    of    the    Company    and    the    jurisdiction    in    which    each    is    incorporated.    The 
 Company    and    each    of    its    Subsidiaries    is    duly    qualified    as    a    foreign    corporation    to    do    business 
 and    is    in    good    standing    in    every    jurisdiction    in    which    its    ownership    or    use    of    property    or    the 
 nature    of    the    business    conducted    by    it  makes    such    qualification    necessary    except    where    the

       Material Adverse Effect         means any material adverse effect      on the business, operations, assets,  
 financial condition or    prospects of the    Company or    its Subsidiaries,    if    any,    taken    as    a whole,    or 
 on    the    transactions    contemplated    hereby    or    by    the    agreements    or    instruments    to    be    entered    into 
 in    connection    herewith.      Subsidiaries       means    any    corporation    or    other    organization,    whether 
 incorporated    or    unincorporated,    in    which    the    Company    owns,    directly    or    indirectly,    any    equity

 the    Company    and    the    consummation    by    it    of    the    transactions    contemplated    hereby    and    thereby 
 (including    without  limitation,    the  issuance    of    the    Note  and    the  issuance    and    reservation    for 
 issuance    of    the    Conversion    Shares    issuable    upon    conversion    and    exercise    thereof)    have    been 
    duly authorized      by the Company   s Board of Directors and no      further consent      or authorization of  
 the    Company,    its    Board    of    Directors,    or    its    shareholders    is    required,    (iii)    this    Agreement    has 
 been    duly    executed    and    delivered    by    the    Company    by    its    authorized    representative,    and    such 
 authorized  representative     is  the  true  and  official  representative     with  authority  to     sign  this 
 Agreement    and    the    other    documents    executed    in    connection    herewith    and    bind    the    Company

 exercisable    for,    or    convertible    into    or    exchangeable    for    shares    of    Common    Stock.    All    of    such 
 outstanding    shares of capital stock are, or upon issuance will be, duly authorized,    validly issued, 
 fully  paid  and     non-assessable.     No     shares  of  capital  stock  of  the     Company  are  subject     to 
 preemptive    rights or    any other    similar    rights of the shareholders of the Company or    any liens or 
 encumbrances    imposed    through the    actions or    failure to    act    of the Company.    As    of the effective 
 date  of  this  Agreement,  and  except  as  disclosed  in  the     SEC  Documents,  (i)  there  are     no 
 outstanding    options,    warrants,    scrip,    rights    to    subscribe    for,    puts,    calls,    rights    of    first    refusal, 
 agreements,    understandings,    claims or other    commitments or    rights of any character    whatsoever 
 relating    to,    or    securities,  notes    or    rights    convertible  into  or    exchangeable  for    any    shares    of 
 capital stock of the    Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or arrangements by which the Company 
 or    any of    its    Subsidiaries    is    or    may    become    bound    to    issue    additional    shares    of capital    stock    of 
 the    Company    or    any    of    its    Subsidiaries,    (ii)    there    are    no    agreements    or    arrangements    under 
 which    the    Company    or    any    of    its    Subsidiaries    is    obligated    to    register    the    sale    of    any    of    its    or 
 their  securities  under  the  1933  Act  and  (iii)  there  are  no  anti-dilution  or  price  adjustment 
 provisions    contained    in    any    security    issued    by    the    Company    (or    in    any    agreement    providing 
 rights    to    security    holders)    that    will    be    triggered    by    the    issuance    of    any    of    the    Securities.    The 
 Company has furnished to the Purchaser true and correct    copies of the Company   s Certificate of 
    Incorporation      as      in      effect      on      the      date      hereof      (   Certificate      of      Incorporation   ),      the      Company   s  
 By-laws,     as     in     effect     on  the  date     hereof  (the        By-laws   ),     and  the  terms  of  all  securities 
 convertible    into or exercisable    for Common Stock of the Company and the material rights of the 
 holders thereof in respect thereto. 
  d) 
 Issuance     of     Shares.     The     Conversion     Shares     are     duly     authorized     and 
 reserved    for    issuance    and,    upon    conversion    of the    Note,    as the case    may    be,    in    accordance    with 
 their    respective    terms,    will    be    validly    issued,    fully    paid    and    non-assessable,    and    free    from    all 
 taxes,    liens,    claims    and    encumbrances    with    respect    to    the    issue    thereof    and    shall    not    be    subject 
 to    preemptive    rights or other    similar    rights of shareholders of the Company and    will    not    impose 
 personal liability upon the holder thereof. 
  e) 
 Acknowledgment     of     Dilution.     The     Company   s     executive     officers     and 
 directors  understand  the     nature  of    the  Securities  being  sold  hereby  and  recognize  that  the 
 issuance    of    the    Securities    will    have    a    potential    dilutive    effect    on    the    equity    holdings    of    other 
    holders      of      the      Company   s      equity      or      rights      to      receive      equity      of      the      Company.       The      board      of  
 directors of the Company has concluded,    in its good faith business judgment    that the issuance of 
 the    Securities    is    in    the    best    interests of the    Company.     The    Company    specifically acknowledges 
 that    its    obligation    to    issue    the    Conversion    Shares    upon    conversion    of the    Notes    is    binding    upon 
 the     Company     and     enforceable     regardless     of     the     dilution     such     issuance     may     have     on  the 
 ownership    interests of other stockholders of the Company or parties entitled to    receive equity of 
 the Company.

 SEC    Document    or    other    document    filed    with    the    SEC,    or    (iii)    result    in    a    violation    of    any    law, 
 rule,  regulation,  order,  judgment  or  decree  (including  federal    and  state  securities  laws  and 
 regulations    and    regulations    of    any    self-regulatory    organizations    to    which    the    Company    or    its 
 securities    are    subject)    applicable    to    the    Company    or    any    of    its    Subsidiaries    or    by    which    any 
 property   or asset    of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected (except    for such 
 conflicts,  defaults,  terminations,  amendments,  accelerations,  cancellations  and  violations  as 
 would  not,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect).  Neither  the 
 Company    nor    any    of    its    Subsidiaries    is    in    violation    of    its    Certificate    of    Incorporation,    By-laws 
 or    other    organizational    documents    and    neither    the    Company    nor    any    of    its    Subsidiaries    is    in 
 default    (and    no    event    has    occurred    which    with    notice    or    lapse    of    time    or    both    could    put    the 
 Company    or    any    of    its    Subsidiaries    in    default)    under,    and    neither    the    Company    nor    any    of    its 
 Subsidiaries    has    taken    any    action    or    failed    to    take    any    action    that    would    give    to    others    any 
 rights    of    termination,    amendment,    acceleration    or    cancellation    of,    any    agreement,    indenture    or 
 instrument    to    which the    Company or    any of its Subsidiaries    is a party or    by which    any property 
 or    assets    of    the    Company    or    any    of    its    Subsidiaries    is    bound    or    affected,    except    for    possible 
 defaults    as    would    not,    individually    or    in    the    aggregate,    have    a    Material    Adverse    Effect.    The 
 businesses    of    the    Company    and    its    Subsidiaries,    if    any,    are    not    being    conducted,    and    shall    not

 ordinance    or    regulation of any governmental entity.    Except    as specifically    contemplated    by this

 registration   with,      any   court,   governmental   agency,      regulatory   agency,      self   regulatory 
 organization or    stock    market    or    any third    party in    order    for    it    to    execute,    deliver    or    perform any 
 of    its    obligations    under    this    Agreement    and    the    Note    in    accordance    with    the    terms    hereof    or

 the    Company    is    required    to    obtain    pursuant    to    the    preceding    sentence    have    been    obtained    or 
 effected     on  or     prior     to     the     date     hereof.     The     Company     is     not     in     violation     of     the     listing 
 requirements of the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (the    OTCBB   ), or OTCQB, or OTC Pink 
 and    does    not    reasonably    anticipate    that    the    Common    Stock    will    be    delisted    by    the    OTCBB,    or 
 OTCQB, or    OTC    Pink    in the    foreseeable    future.    The Company and    its Subsidiaries are unaware 
 of any facts or circumstances which might    give rise to any   of the foregoing.

 requirements    of    the    Securities    Exchange    Act    of    1934,    as    amended    (   1934    Act       or       Exchange

 statements    as    have    been    amended    or    updated    in    subsequent    filings    prior    the    date    hereof).    As    of 
 their    respective    dates,    the    financial statements of the    Company    included    in    the    SEC Documents 
 complied    as    to    form    in    all    material    respects    with    applicable    accounting    requirements    and    the 
 published    rules    and    regulations    of the    SEC    with    respect    thereto.    Such    financial    statements    have 
 been  prepared     in  accordance     with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles, 
 consistently    applied,    during    the    periods    involved    and    fairly    present    in    all    material    respects    the 
 consolidated    financial position    of the    Company and    its consolidated    Subsidiaries as of the    dates 
 thereof    and    the    consolidated    results    of    their    operations    and    cash    flows    for    the    periods    then 
 ended  (subject,  in    the  case    of    unaudited    statements,    to  normal    year-end    audit  adjustments). 
 Except    as set    forth    in the    financial    statements of the    Company    included    in    the    SEC Documents, 
 the    Company    has    no    liabilities,    contingent    or    otherwise,    other    than    (i)    liabilities    incurred    in    the 
 ordinary    course    of    business,    and    (ii)    obligations    under    contracts    and    commitments    incurred    in 
 the    ordinary course    of business and    not    required    under    generally accepted    accounting    principles 
 to    be    reflected    in    such    financial    statements,    which,    individually    or    in    the    aggregate,    are    not 
 material to the    financial condition or    operating results of the Company. The Company    is subject 
 to the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act. 
  h) 
 Absence    of    Certain    Changes.    Since    March    31,    2016,    there    has    been    no

 directors    in    their    capacity    as    such,    that    could    have    a    Material    Adverse    Effect.    Schedule    3(i)

 Subsidiaries    are    unaware    of    any    facts    or    circumstances    which    might    give    rise    to    any    of    the

 respect  to  any  Intellectual  Property  necessary  to  enable  it  to  conduct  its  business  as  now 
 operated  (and,  as  presently  contemplated  to  be  operated  in  the  future);  to  the  best  of  the

 give  rise  to  any  of  the  foregoing.  The  Company  and  each  of  its  Subsidiaries  have  taken 
 reasonable     security     measures     to   protect   the     secrecy,     confidentiality     and   value     of     their 
 Intellectual   Property. 
  k)

 by    any    jurisdiction    to    which    it    is    subject    (unless    and    only    to    the    extent    that    the    Company    and 
 each  of  its  Subsidiaries  has  set  aside  on  its  books  provisions  reasonably  adequate  for  the

 the    periods    to    which    such    returns,    reports    or    declarations    apply.    There    are    no    unpaid    taxes    in 
 any    material    amount  claimed    to  be    due    by    the    taxing    authority    of    any    jurisdiction,    and    the 
 officers of the    Company know    of no    basis    for    any    such claim.    The Company    has    not    executed    a 
 waiver    with    respect    to    the    statute    of    limitations    relating    to    the    assessment    or    collection    of    any

 Subsidiaries,    in    each    case    free    and    clear    of all    liens,    encumbrances and    defects except    such as 
 are    described    in    Schedule    3(t)    or    such    as    would    not    have    a    Material    Adverse    Effect.    Any real

 but    not    limited    to,    directors and    officers    insurance coverage    with coverage amounts    that    are at 
 least    equal to    the    aggregate    Purchase Price.     Neither the Company nor    any Subsidiary has any 
 reason to    believe    that    it    will    not    be    able to    renew    its existing    insurance coverage as and    when 
 such coverage expires or to obtain similar    coverage from similar    insurers as may be necessary 
 to continue    its business without    a significant    increase in cost.

 the    Company    and    each    of    its    Subsidiaries    maintain    a    system    of    internal    accounting    controls 
      sufficient,     in  the     judgment     of  the     Company   s     board     of  directors,     to     provide     reasonable 
 assurance  that  (i)  transactions  are  executed     in  accordance  with  management   s  general  or 
 specific    authorizations,    (ii)    transactions    are    recorded    as    necessary    to    permit    preparation    of 
 financial  statements     in     conformity  with  generally  accepted     accounting     principles     and     to 
 maintain  asset  accountability,     (iii)  access  to  assets  is  permitted  only  in  accordance  with 
      management   s general or    specific    authorization and    (iv)    the recorded    accountability    for    assets 
 is    compared    with    the    existing    assets    at    reasonable    intervals    and    appropriate    action    is    taken 
 with respect to    any   differences. 
  w) 
 Foreign   Corrupt      Practices.      Neither      the   Company,      nor      any   of   its 
 Subsidiaries,    nor    any director, officer,    agent,    employee or other    person acting    on behalf of the

 Company, used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment    or other 
 unlawful    expenses    relating    to    political activity;    made    any    direct    or    indirect    unlawful    payment

 amended,    or    made    any    bribe,    rebate,    payoff,    influence    payment,    kickback    or    other    unlawful

 existing  debts    as    they  become  absolute  and  matured)  and  currently    the  Company  has  no 
 information    that  would  lead  it  to  reasonably    conclude    that  the    Company    would  not,  after 
 giving    effect    to    the    transaction    contemplated    by    this    Agreement,    have    the    ability    to,    nor    does 
 it    intend    to    take    any    action    that    would    impair    its    ability    to,    pay    its    debts    from    time    to    time 
 incurred    in connection therewith as such debts mature. 
  y)

 form)    any    certificate    for    Conversion    Shares    to    be    issued    to    the    Purchaser    upon    conversion    of 
 or    otherwise    pursuant    to    the    Note    as    and    when    required    by    the    Note    and    this    Agreement;    and 
 (iii)    it    will not    fail   to remove (or direct    its transfer agent    not to    remove or impair, delay, and/or

 the    Note    and    this    Agreement.    Nothing    in    this    Section    shall    affect    in    any    way    the    Purchaser   s 
 obligations  and  agreement  set  forth  in  Section  2(g)  hereof    to  comply  with    all  applicable 
 prospectus  delivery  requirements,  if  any,  upon  re-sale  of    the  Securities.  If    the  Purchaser 
 provides the    Company with (i)    an opinion of counsel    in    form,    substance and    scope customary 
 for    opinions    in    comparable    transactions,    to    the    effect    that    a    public    sale    or    transfer    of    such 
 Securities    may    be    made    without    registration    under    the    1933    Act    and    such    sale    or    transfer    is 
 effected    or    (ii)    the    Purchaser    provides    reasonable    assurances    that    the    Securities    can    be    sold 
 pursuant     to     Rule     144,     the     Company     shall     permit     the     transfer,     and,     in     the     case     of     the 
 Conversion    Shares,    promptly    instruct    its    transfer    agent    to    issue    one    or    more    certificates,    free 
 from     restrictive     legend,     in     such     name     and     in     such     denominations     as     specified     by     the 
 Purchaser.    The    Company    acknowledges    that    a    breach    by    it    of    its    obligations    hereunder    will 
 cause    irreparable    harm to the    Purchaser,    by vitiating    the    intent    and    purpose of the transactions 
 contemplated    hereby.    Accordingly,    the    Company    acknowledges    that    the    remedy    at    law    for    a 
 breach    of    its    obligations    under    this    Section    5    may    be    inadequate    and    agrees,    in    the    event    of a 
 breach  or  threatened  breach  by  the  Company  of  the  provisions  of  this  Section,  that  the 
 Purchaser     shall  be  entitled,     in  addition  to     all  other  available  remedies,     to     an  injunction 
 restraining    any    breach    and    requiring    immediate    transfer,    without    the    necessity    of    showing 
 economic    loss and without any bond or other security being required. 
 6.   Injunction Posting    of    Bond.     In    the    event    the    Purchaser    shall    elect    to    convert    the 
 Note    or    any    parts    thereof,    the    Company    may    not    refuse    conversion    or    exercise    based    on    any 
 claim    that    Purchaser    or    anyone    associated    or    affiliated    with    Purchaser    has    been    engaged    in 
 any    violation    of    law,    or    for    any    other    reason.      In    connection    with    any    injunction    sought    or 
 attempted    by the    Company,    the    Company shall    be required    to    post    a bond    at    least    equal to    the 
 greater of either:    (i)    the    outstanding    principal amount    of the Note; and    (ii)    the    market    value    of 
 the    Conversion Shares sought    to    be converted,    exercised    or    issued,    based    on the sale price    per 
 share of Common Stock on   the principal market    on which it    is    traded. 
 7.   Delivery   of Unlegended Shares.

             Unlegended          Shares          Delivery  Date      )      after      the      business      day      on      which      the      Company      has  
 15 
 SPA          CETY, T1, 2016-06-06 

received     (i)     a     notice  that     Conversion  Shares,     or  any  other  Common  Stock  held     by  the 
 Purchaser    has    been    sold    pursuant    to    a    registration    statement    or    Rule    144    under    the    1933    Act, 
 (ii)    a    representation    that    the    prospectus    delivery    requirements,    or    the    requirements    of    Rule 
 144,  as  applicable  and  if    required,  have  been    satisfied,  (iii)  the  original    share  certificates 
 representing    the    shares    of    Common    Stock    that    have    been    sold,    and    (iv)    in    the    case    of    sales 
 under Rule 144, customary   representation letters of the    Purchaser and,    if required,    Purchaser   s 
 broker    regarding    compliance    with    the    requirements    of Rule    144,    the    Company    at    its    expense, 
 (y)    shall    deliver,    and    shall    cause  legal    counsel    selected    by    the  Company    to  deliver    to  its 
 transfer  agent  (with  copies  to     Purchaser)  an  appropriate  instruction  and  opinion  of  such 
 counsel,    directing    the    delivery of shares    of Common    Stock    without    any    legends    including    the 
       legend       set       forth       in       Section       4(h)       above       (the             Unlegended           Shares      );       and       (z)       cause       the  
 transmission    of    the    certificates    representing    the    Unlegended    Shares    together    with    a    legended 
 certificate    representing    the    balance    of    the    submitted    Common    Stock    certificate,    if    any,    to    the 
 Purchaser  at    the    address    specified  in    the  notice  of    sale,    via    express    courier,    by    electronic 
 transfer or otherwise on or before the Unlegended    Shares Delivery   Date. 
  b) 
 The    Company    understands    that    a    delay    in    the    delivery    of    the    Unlegended 
 Shares    later    than    the    Unlegended    Shares    Delivery    Date    could    result    in    economic    loss    to    the 
 Purchaser.    As    compensation    to  Purchaser  for    such    loss,    the    Company    agrees    to  pay    late 
 payment    fees (as liquidated damages and    not    as a penalty) to the    Purchaser    for    late delivery of 
 Unlegended    Shares    in    the    amount    of $1,000.00    per    business    day    after    the    Unlegended    Shares 
 Delivery    Date.    If    during    any    three    hundred    and    sixty    (360)    day    period,    the    Company    fails    to 
 deliver    Unlegended    Shares    as    required    by    this    Section    for    an    aggregate    of    thirty    (30)    days, 
 then  Purchaser  or  assignee  holding  Securities  subject  to  such  default  may,  at  its  option, 
 require    the    Company    to    redeem    all    or    any    portion    of    the    shares    subject    to    such    default    at    a 
 price  per  share  equal    to  the  greater  of    (i)  200%  of    the  most  recent  closing  price  of    the 
 Common    Stock    or    (ii)    a    fraction    in    which    the    numerator    is    the    highest    closing    price    of    the 
 Common Stock during the aforedescribed thirty   (30) day   period and the denominator of which 
 is the    lowest    conversion price during such thirty (30) day period,    multiplied    by the    conversion 
 price  or  exercise  price,  as    the  case  may  be  (    Unlegended  Redemption  Amount    ).    The 
 Company    shall    pay    any    payments    incurred    under    this    Section    in    immediately    available    funds 
 upon demand.

 permitted    but    subject    to    volume    limitations    or    further    restrictions    on    resale    as    a    result    of    the 
 unavailability    to    Subscriber    of    Rule    144(b)(1)(i)    under    the    1933    Act    or    any    successor    rule    (a

 hereunder    at    Closing,    which    offset    shall    constitute    partial    payment    of    such    Purchase    Price    in 
 an amount    equal to    such offset.     Except    as expressly set    forth in this    Agreement    or the Note to

 not    to    insist    upon    or    plead    or    in    any    manner    whatsoever    claim,    and    will    resist    any    and    all 
 efforts to    be    compelled    to    take the    benefit    or    advantage of,    usury laws wherever    enacted,    now 
 or    at    any time    hereafter    in    force,    in    connection    with    any claim,    action    or    proceeding    that    may 
 be     brought     by     the     Purchaser     in  order     to     enforce     any  right     or     remedy  under     the     Note. 
 Notwithstanding    any    provision    to    the    contrary    contained    in  herein    or    under    the    Note,    it    is 
 expressly    agreed  and    provided  that  the    total    liability    of    the  Company    under  the  Note    for

       applicable      law      (the         Maximum      Rate   ),      and,      without      limiting      the      foregoing,      in      no      event      shall  
 any    rate    of    interest    or    default    interest,    or    both    of them,    when    aggregated    with    any    other    sums

 by  law  and     applicable     to  the     Note  is     increased  or  decreased     by  statute  or  any  official 
 governmental action subsequent    to    the date hereof, the new    maximum contract    rate of interest 
 allowed    by    law    will    be    the    Maximum    Rate    applicable    to    the    Note    from    the    effective    date 
 forward,    unless    such    application    is    precluded    by    applicable    law.     If    under    any    circumstances 
 whatsoever,    interest    in    excess of the    Maximum Rate is paid    by the    Company to    the    Purchaser 
 with    respect  to  indebtedness    evidenced  by    the  Note,  such    excess    shall  be  applied  by  the 
 Purchaser    to    the    unpaid    principal    balance    of    any    such    indebtedness    or    be    refunded    to    the

                    CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE

      FOR  VALUE  RECEIVED,  CLEAN  ENERGY  TECHNOLOGIES,  INC.,  a  Nevada
corporation   (hereinafter   called   the   "Borrower"),   hereby   promises
to   pay   to   the   order   of
AUCTUS   FUND,   LLC,   a   Delaware   limited   liability   company,   or
registered   assigns   (the
"Holder")  the  sum  of  US$77,750  together  with  any  interest  as  set
forth  herein,  on  April  6,  2017
(the "Maturity Date"), and to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance
hereof at the rate of ten
percent  (10%)  (the  "Interest  Rate")  per  annum  from  the  date  hereof
(the  "Issue  Date")  until  the
same  becomes  due  and  payable,  whether  at  maturity  or  upon  acceleration
or  by  prepayment  or
otherwise.   This  Note  may  not  be  prepaid  in  whole  or  in  part  except
as  otherwise  explicitly  set
forth  herein  with  the  written  consent  of  the  Holder  which  may  be
withheld  for  any  reason  or  for
no reason. Any amount of principal or interest on this Note which is not paid
when due shall bear
interest  at  the  rate  of  twenty-four  percent  (24%)  per  annum  from  the
due  date  thereof  until  the
same is paid (the "Default Interest").   Interest shall commence accruing on the
date that the Note
is  fully  paid  and  shall  be  computed  on  the  basis  of  a  360-day  year
and  the  actual  number  of  days
elapsed.  All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common
stock, $0.001 par
value  per  share  (the  "Common  Stock")  in  accordance  with  the  terms
hereof)  shall  be  made  in
lawful  money  of  the  United  States  of  America.   All  payments  shall  be
made  at  such  address  as
the  Holder  shall  hereafter  give  to  the  Borrower  by  written  notice
made  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of  this  Note.   Whenever  any  amount  expressed  to  be  due  by
the  terms  of  this  Note  is
due on any day which is not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the
next succeeding
day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which
is not the date on
which  this  Note  is  paid  in  full,  the  extension  of  the  due  date
thereof  shall  not  be  taken  into
account  for  purposes  of  determining  the  amount  of  interest  due  on
such  date.   As  used  in  this
Note,  the  term  "business  day"  shall  mean  any  day  other  than  a
Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  day  on
which  commercial  banks  in  the  city  of  New  York,  New  York  are
authorized  or  required  by  law

or  executive  order  to  remain  closed.    Each  capitalized  term  used
herein,  and  not  otherwise
defined,  shall  have  the  meaning  ascribed  thereto  in  that  certain
Securities  Purchase  Agreement
dated   the   date   hereof,   pursuant   to   which   this   Note   was
originally   issued   (the   "Purchase
Agreement").

      This  Note  is  free  from  all  taxes,  liens,  claims  and  encumbrances
with  respect  to  the  issue
thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other similar rights of
shareholders of the
Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof.

      The following terms shall apply to this Note:

                      ARTICLE I.  CONVERSION RIGHTS

           1.1 Conversion  Right.   The  Holder  shall  have  the  right  from
time  to  time,  and  at
any  time  following  one  hundred  eighty  (180)  days  after  the  date  of
this  Note  and  ending  on  the
later  of  (i)  the  Maturity  Date  and  (ii)  the  date  of  payment  of  the
Default  Amount  (as  defined  in
Article  III)  pursuant  to  Section  1.6(a)  or  Article  III,  each  in
respect  of  the  remaining  outstanding
principal  amount  of  this  Note  to  convert  all  or  any  part  of  the
outstanding  and  unpaid  principal
amount  of  this  Note  into  fully  paid  and  non-assessable  shares  of
Common  Stock,  as  such
Common  Stock  exists  on  the  Issue  Date,  or  any  shares  of  capital
stock  or  other  securities  of  the
Borrower  into  which  such  Common  Stock  shall  hereafter  be  changed  or
reclassified  at  the
Conversion  Price  (as  defined  below)  determined  as  provided  herein  (a
"Conversion");  provided,
however,  that  in  no  event  shall  the  Holder  be  entitled  to  convert
any  portion  of  this  Note  in
excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the
number of shares
of  Common  Stock  beneficially  owned  by  the  Holder  and  its  affiliates
(other  than  shares  of
Common   Stock   which   may   be   deemed   beneficially   owned   through
the   ownership   of   the
unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of
any other security
of  the  Borrower  subject  to  a  limitation  on  conversion  or  exercise
analogous  to  the  limitations
contained  herein)  and  (2)  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
issuable  upon  the  conversion
of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this
proviso is being made,
would  result  in  beneficial  ownership  by  the  Holder  and  its  affiliates
of  more  than  4.99%  of  the
outstanding shares of Common Stock.   For purposes of the proviso to the
immediately preceding
sentence,  beneficial  ownership  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with
Section  13(d)  of  the
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  "Exchange  Act"),  and
Regulations  13D-G
thereunder,   except   as   otherwise   provided   in   clause   (1)   of   such
proviso,   provided,   further,
however, that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at
the election of
the  Holder,  not  less  than  61  days'  prior  notice  to  the  Borrower,  and
the  provisions  of  the
conversion   limitation   shall   continue   to   apply   until   such   61st
day   (or   such   later   date,   as
determined  by  the  Holder,  as  may  be  specified  in  such  notice  of
waiver).   The  number  of  shares
of  Common  Stock  to  be  issued  upon  each  conversion  of  this  Note  shall
be  determined  by
dividing  the  Conversion  Amount  (as  defined  below)  by  the  applicable
Conversion  Price  then  in
effect  on  the  date  specified  in  the  notice  of  conversion,  in  the
form  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A
(the  "Notice  of  Conversion"),  delivered  to  the  Borrower  by  the  Holder
in  accordance  with
Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by
facsimile or e-mail (or
by  other  means  resulting  in,  or  reasonably  expected  to  result  in,
notice)  to  the  Borrower  before
6:00  p.m.,  New  York,  New  York  time  on  such  conversion  date  (the
"Conversion  Date").   The

2

term  "Conversion  Amount"  means,  with  respect  to  any  conversion  of  this
Note,  the  sum  of  (1)
the  principal  amount  of  this  Note  to  be  converted  in  such  conversion
plus  (2)  at  the  Holder's
option,  accrued  and  unpaid  interest,  if  any,  on  such  principal  amount
at  the  interest  rates
provided  in  this  Note  to  the  Conversion  Date,  provided  however,  that
the  Borrower  shall  have
the  right  to  pay  any  or  all  interest  in  cash  plus  (3)  at  the
Holder's  option,  Default  Interest,  if  any,
on  the  amounts  referred  to  in  the  immediately  preceding  clauses  (1)
and/or  (2)  plus  (4)  at  the
Holder's option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and
1.4(g) hereof.

           1.2 Conversion Price.

                 (a)  Calculation  of  Conversion  Price.   Subject  to  the
adjustments  described
herein,  and  provided  that  no  Event  of  Default  (as  defined  in  Article
III)  has  occurred,  the
conversion  price  (the  "Conversion  Price")  shall  equal  the  lesser  of
(i)  55%  multiplied  by  the
lowest  Trading  Price  (as  defined  below)  (representing  a  discount  rate
of  45%)  during  the
previous  twenty  (20)  Trading  Day  period  ending  on  the  latest  complete
Trading  Day  prior  to  the
date  of  this  Note  and  (ii)  the  Variable  Conversion  Price  (as  defined
herein)  (subject  to  equitable
adjustments  for  stock  splits,  stock  dividends  or  rights  offerings  by
the  Borrower  relating  to  the
Borrower's   securities   or   the   securities   of   any   subsidiary   of
the   Borrower,   combinations,
recapitalization,  reclassifications,  extraordinary  distributions  and
similar  events).   The  "Variable
Conversion   Price"   shall   mean   55%   multiplied   by   the   Market
Price   (as   defined   herein)
(representing  a  discount  rate  of  45%).    "Market  Price"  means  the
lowest  Trading  Price  (as
defined  below)  for  the  Common  Stock  during  the  twenty  (20)  Trading
Day  period  ending  on  the
latest  complete  Trading  Day  prior  to  the  Conversion  Date.    "Trading
Price"  means,  for  any
security  as  of  any  date,  the  lesser  of:  (i)  the  lowest  trade  price
on  the  Over-the-Counter  Bulletin
Board  (the  "OTCBB"),  OTCQB  or  applicable  trading  market  as  reported  by
a  reliable  reporting
service  ("Reporting  Service")  designated  by  the  Holder  or,  if  the
OTCBB  is  not  the  principal
trading  market  for  such  security,  the  trading  price  of  such  security
on  the  principal  securities
exchange  or  trading  market  where  such  security  is  listed  or  traded
or,  if  no  trading  price  of  such
security  is  available  in  any  of  the  foregoing  manners,  the  average  of
the  trading  prices  of  any
market  makers  for  such  security  that  are  listed  in  the  "pink  sheets"
by  the  OTC  Markets  Group,
Inc.,  or  (ii)  the  closing  bid  price  on  the  OTCBB,  OTCQB  or
applicable  trading  market  as
reported  by  a  Reporting  Service  designated  by  the  Holder  or,  if  the
OTCBB  is  not  the  principal
trading  market  for  such  security,  the  closing  bid  price  of  such
security  on  the  principal  securities
exchange  or  trading  market  where  such  security  is  listed  or  traded
or,  if  no  closing  bid  price  of
such  security  is  available  in  any  of  the  foregoing  manners,  the
average  of  the  closing  bid  prices
of  any  market  makers  for  such  security  that  are  listed  in  the  "pink
sheets"  by  the  OTC  Markets
Group,  Inc.   To  the  extent  the  Conversion  Price  of  the  Borrower's
Common  Stock  closes  below
the  par  value  per  share,  the  Borrower  will  take  all  steps  necessary
to  solicit  the  consent  of  the
stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The
Borrower agrees
to  honor  all  conversions  submitted  pending  this  adjustment.
Furthermore,  the  Conversion  Price
may  be  adjusted  downward  if,  within  three  (3)  business  days  of  the
transmittal  of  the  Notice  of
Conversion to the Borrower, the Common Stock has a closing bid which is 5% or
lower than that
set  forth  in  the  Notice  of  Conversion.  If  the  shares  of  the
Borrower's  Common  Stock  have  not
been  delivered  within  three  (3)  business  days  to  the  Borrower,  the
Notice  of  Conversion  may  be
rescinded.   At  any  time  after  the  Closing  Date,  if  in  the  case  that
the  Borrower's  Common  Stock
is  not  deliverable  by  DWAC  (including  if  the  Borrower's  transfer  agent
has  a  policy  prohibiting

3

or   limiting   delivery   of   shares   of   the   Borrower's   Common   Stock
specified   in   a   Notice   of
Conversion), an additional 10% discount will apply for all future conversions
under all Notes.   If
in  the  case  that  the  Borrower's  Common  Stock  is  "chilled"  for  deposit
into  the  DTC  system  and
only   eligible   for   clearing   deposit,   an   additional   15%   discount
shall   apply   for   all   future
conversions  under  all  Notes  while  the  "chill"  is  in  effect.   If  in
the  case  of  both  of  the  above,  an
additional  cumulative  25%  discount  shall  apply.   Additionally,  if  the
Company  ceases  to  be  a
reporting  company  pursuant  to  the  1934  Act  or  if  the  Note  cannot  be
converted  into  free  trading
shares  after  one  hundred  eighty-one  (181)  days  from  the  Issue  Date,
an  additional  15%  discount
will  be  attributed  to  the  Conversion  Price.   If  the  Trading  Price
cannot  be  calculated  for  such
security  on  such  date  in  the  manner  provided  above,  the  Trading  Price
shall  be  the  fair  market
value  as  mutually  determined  by  the  Borrower  and  the  holders  of  a
majority  in  interest  of  the
Notes  being  converted  for  which  the  calculation  of  the  Trading  Price
is  required  in  order  to
determine  the  Conversion  Price  of  such  Notes.   "Trading  Day"  shall
mean  any  day  on  which  the
Common  Stock  is  tradable  for  any  period  on  the  OTCBB,  OTCQB  or  on
the  principal  securities
exchange  or  other  securities  market  on  which  the  Common  Stock  is  then
being  traded.    The
Borrower  shall  be  responsible  for  the  fees  of  its  transfer  agent  and
all  DTC  fees  associated  with
any such issuance.

                 (b)  Conversion  Price  During  Major  Announcements.
Notwithstanding
anything contained in Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower
(i) makes a public
announcement  that  it  intends  to  consolidate  or  merge  with  any  other
corporation  (other  than  a
merger  in  which  the  Borrower  is  the  surviving  or  continuing
corporation  and  its  capital  stock  is
unchanged)  or  sell  or  transfer  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets
of  the  Borrower  or  (ii)  any
person,  group  or  entity  (including  the  Borrower)  publicly  announces  a
tender  offer  to  purchase
50%  or  more  of  the  Borrower's  Common  Stock  (or  any  other  takeover
scheme)  (the  date  of  the
announcement  referred  to  in  clause  (i)  or  (ii)  is  hereinafter  referred
to  as  the   "Announcement
Date"),  then  the  Conversion  Price  shall,  effective  upon  the
Announcement  Date  and  continuing
through  the  Adjusted  Conversion  Price  Termination  Date  (as  defined
below),  be  equal  to  the
lower  of  (x)  the  Conversion  Price  which  would  have  been  applicable
for  a  Conversion  occurring
on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in
effect. From
and   after   the   Adjusted   Conversion   Price   Termination   Date,   the
Conversion   Price   shall   be
determined  as  set  forth  in  this  Section  1.2(a).   For  purposes  hereof,
"Adjusted  Conversion  Price
Termination  Date"  shall  mean,  with  respect  to  any  proposed  transaction
or  tender  offer  (or
takeover  scheme)  for  which  a  public  announcement  as  contemplated  by
this  Section  1.2(b)  has
been  made,  the  date  upon  which  the  Borrower  (in  the  case  of  clause
(i)  above)  or  the  person,
group  or  entity  (in  the  case  of  clause  (ii)  above)  consummates  or
publicly  announces  the
termination  or  abandonment  of  the  proposed  transaction  or  tender  offer
(or  takeover  scheme)
which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.

                 (c)   Pro  Rata  Conversion;  Disputes.  In  the  event  of  a
dispute  as  to  the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a
conversion of this
Note,  the  Borrower  shall  issue  to  the  Holder  the  number  of  shares  of
Common  Stock  not  in
dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 4.13.

           1.3 Authorized   Shares.     The   Borrower   covenants   that
during   the   period   the
conversion  right  exists,  the  Borrower  will  reserve  from  its  authorized
and  unissued  Common

4

Stock  a  sufficient  number  of  shares,  free  from  preemptive  rights,  to
provide  for  the  issuance  of
Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement.
The  Borrower  is  required  at  all  times  to  have  authorized  and  reserved
seven  times  the  number  of
shares  that  is  actually  issuable  upon  full  conversion  of  the  Note
(based  on  the  Conversion  Price
of  the  Notes  in  effect  from  time  to  time)  (the  "Reserved  Amount").
The  Reserved  Amount  shall
be increased from time to time in accordance with the Borrower's obligations
pursuant to Section
3(d)  of  the  Purchase  Agreement.   The  Borrower  represents  that  upon
issuance,  such  shares  will
be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.  In addition, if the
Borrower shall issue
any  securities  or  make  any  change  to  its  capital  structure  which
would  change  the  number  of
shares   of   Common   Stock   into   which   the   Notes   shall   be
convertible   at   the   then   current
Conversion  Price,  the  Borrower  shall  at  the  same  time  make  proper
provision  so  that  thereafter
there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and
reserved, free from
preemptive  rights,  for  conversion  of  the  outstanding  Notes.   The
Borrower  (i)  acknowledges  that
it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the
Common Stock issuable
upon  conversion  of  this  Note,  and  (ii) agrees  that  its  issuance  of
this  Note  shall  constitute  full
authority  to  its  officers  and  agents  who  are  charged  with  the  duty
of  executing  stock  certificates
to  execute  and  issue  the  necessary  certificates  for  shares  of  Common
Stock  in  accordance  with
the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Note.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
in  no  event  shall  the
Reserved   Amount   be   lower   than   the   initial   Reserved   Amount,
regardless   of   any   prior
conversions.

           If,  at  any  time  the  Borrower  does  not  maintain  or  replenish
the  Reserved  Amount
within three (3) business days of the request of the Holder, the principal
amount of the Note shall
increase  by  Five  Thousand  and  No/100  United  States  Dollars  ($5,000)
(under  Holder's  and
Borrower's  expectation  that  any  principal  amount  increase  will  tack
back  to  the  Issue  Date)  per
occurrence.

           1.4 Method of Conversion.

                 (a)  Mechanics  of  Conversion.   Subject  to  Section  1.1,
this  Note  may  be
converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after
the Issue Date, by
(A) submitting  to  the  Borrower  a  Notice  of  Conversion  (by  facsimile,
e-mail  or  other  reasonable
means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York, New
York  time)  and  (B) subject  to  Section  1.4(b),  surrendering  this  Note
at  the  principal  office  of  the
Borrower.

                 (b)  Surrender  of  Note  Upon  Conversion.   Notwithstanding
anything  to  the
contrary  set  forth  herein,  upon  conversion  of  this  Note  in  accordance
with  the  terms  hereof,  the
Holder  shall  not  be  required  to  physically  surrender  this  Note  to  the
Borrower  unless  the  entire
unpaid  principal  amount  of  this  Note  is  so  converted.    The  Holder
and  the  Borrower  shall
maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such
conversions or
shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the
Borrower, so  as  not to
require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion.  In the event
of any dispute or
discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall, prima facie, be controlling and
determinative in
the  absence  of  manifest  error.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any
portion  of  this  Note  is
converted  as  aforesaid,  the  Holder  may  not  transfer  this  Note  unless
the  Holder  first  physically

5

surrenders  this  Note  to  the  Borrower,  whereupon  the  Borrower  will
forthwith  issue  and  deliver
upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder
(upon payment by
the  Holder  of  any  applicable  transfer  taxes)  may  request,  representing
in  the  aggregate  the
remaining unpaid principal amount of  this  Note.   The Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of
this  Note,  acknowledge  and  agree  that,  by  reason  of  the  provisions  of
this  paragraph,  following
conversion  of  a  portion  of  this  Note,  the  unpaid  and  unconverted
principal  amount  of  this  Note
represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.

                 (c)  Payment  of  Taxes.   The  Borrower  shall  not  be
required  to  pay  any  tax
which  may  be  payable  in  respect  of  any  transfer  involved  in  the
issue  and  delivery  of  shares  of
Common  Stock  or  other  securities  or  property  on  conversion  of  this
Note  in  a  name  other  than
that  of  the  Holder  (or  in  street  name),  and  the  Borrower  shall  not
be  required  to  issue  or  deliver
any  such  shares  or  other  securities  or  property  unless  and  until  the
person  or  persons  (other  than
the  Holder  or  the  custodian  in  whose  street  name  such  shares  are  to
be  held  for  the  Holder's
account)  requesting  the  issuance  thereof  shall  have  paid  to  the
Borrower  the  amount  of  any  such
tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax
has been paid.

                 (d)  Delivery  of  Common  Stock  Upon  Conversion.    Upon
receipt  by  the
Borrower  from  the  Holder  of  a  facsimile  transmission  or  e-mail  (or
other  reasonable  means  of
communication)  of  a  Notice  of  Conversion  meeting  the  requirements  for
conversion  as  provided
in  this  Section  1.4,  the  Borrower  shall  issue  and  deliver  or  cause
to  be  issued  and  delivered  to  or
upon  the  order  of  the  Holder  certificates  for  the  Common  Stock
issuable  upon  such  conversion
within  three  (3)  business  days  after  such  receipt  (the  "Deadline")
(and,  solely  in  the  case  of
conversion  of  the  entire  unpaid  principal  amount  hereof,  surrender  of
this  Note)  in  accordance
with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.

                 (e)  Obligation  of  Borrower  to  Deliver  Common  Stock.
Upon  receipt  by
the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the
holder of record of
the  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  such  conversion,  the  outstanding
principal  amount  and  the
amount  of  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  on  this  Note  shall  be  reduced
to  reflect  such  conversion,
and,  unless  the  Borrower  defaults  on  its  obligations  under  this
Article  I,  all  rights  with  respect  to
the  portion  of  this  Note  being  so  converted  shall  forthwith  terminate
except  the  right  to  receive
the   Common   Stock   or   other   securities,   cash   or   other   assets,
as   herein   provided,   on   such
conversion.    If  the  Holder  shall  have  given  a  Notice  of  Conversion
as  provided  herein,  the
Borrower's  obligation  to  issue  and  deliver  the  certificates  for  Common
Stock  shall  be  absolute
and  unconditional,  irrespective  of  the  absence  of  any  action  by  the
Holder  to  enforce  the  same,
any  waiver  or  consent  with  respect  to  any  provision  thereof,  the
recovery  of  any  judgment
against  any  person  or  any  action  to  enforce  the  same,  any  failure  or
delay  in  the  enforcement  of
any  other  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to  the  holder  of  record,  or  any
setoff,  counterclaim,
recoupment,  limitation  or  termination,  or  any  breach  or  alleged  breach
by  the  Holder  of  any
obligation  to  the  Borrower,  and  irrespective  of  any  other  circumstance
which  might  otherwise
limit  such  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to  the  Holder  in  connection
with  such  conversion.   The
Conversion  Date  specified  in  the  Notice  of  Conversion  shall  be  the
Conversion  Date  so  long  as
the  Notice  of  Conversion  is  received  by  the  Borrower  before  5:00
p.m.,  New  York,  New  York
time, on such date.

(f)  Delivery   of   Common   Stock   by   Electronic
Transfer.     In   lieu   of
delivering   physical   certificates   representing   the   Common   Stock
issuable   upon   conversion,
provided   the   Borrower   is   participating   in   the   Depository   Trust
Company   ("DTC")   Fast
Automated   Securities   Transfer   ("FAST")   program,   upon   request   of
the   Holder   and   its
compliance  with  the  provisions  contained  in  Section  1.1  and  in  this
Section  1.4,  the  Borrower
shall  use  its  commercially  reasonable  best  efforts  to  cause  its
transfer  agent  to  electronically
transmit  the  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  to  the  Holder  by
crediting  the  account  of
Holder's  Prime  Broker  with  DTC  through  its  Deposit  Withdrawal  At
Custodian  ("DWAC")
system.

                 (g)   DTC  Eligibility  &  Sub-Penny.  If  the  Borrower  fails
to  maintain  its
status  as  "DTC  Eligible"  for  any  reason,  or,  if  the  Conversion  Price
is  less  than  $0.01,  the
principal  amount  of  the  Note  shall  increase  by  Fifteen  Thousand  and
No/100  United  States
Dollars   ($15,000)   (under   Holder's   and   Borrower's   expectation   that
any   principal   amount
increase  will  tack  back  to  the  Issue  Date).   In  addition,  the
Variable  Conversion  Price  shall  be
redefined  to  mean  forty  percent  (40%)  multiplied  by  the  Market  Price,
subject  to  adjustment  as
provided in this Note.

                 (h)  Failure   to   Deliver   Common   Stock   Prior   to
Delivery   Deadline.
Without  in  any  way  limiting  the  Holder's  right  to  pursue  other
remedies,  including  actual
damages  and/or  equitable  relief,  the  parties  agree  that  if  delivery  of
the  Common  Stock  issuable
upon  conversion  of  this  Note  is  not  delivered  by  the  Deadline  (other
than  a  failure  due  to  the
circumstances  described  in  Section  1.3  above,  which  failure  shall  be
governed  by  such  Section)
the  Borrower  shall  pay  to  the  Holder  $2,000  per  day  in  cash,  for
each  day  beyond  the  Deadline
that  the  Borrower  fails  to  deliver  such  Common  Stock  until  the
Borrower  issues  and  delivers  a
certificate  to  the  Holder  or  credit  the  Holder's  balance  account  with
OTC  for  the  number  of
shares  of  Common  Stock  to  which  the  Holder  is  entitled  upon  such
Holder's  conversion  of  any
Conversion Amount (under Holder's and Borrower's expectation that any damages
will tack back
to  the  Issue  Date)..   Such  cash  amount  shall  be  paid  to  Holder  by
the  fifth  day  of  the  month
following  the  month  in  which  it  has  accrued  or,  at  the  option  of
the  Holder  (by  written  notice  to
the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has
accrued), shall be
added  to  the  principal  amount  of  this  Note,  in  which  event  interest
shall  accrue  thereon  in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Note  and  such  additional  principal
amount  shall  be  convertible
into  Common  Stock  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Note.   The
Borrower  agrees  that  the
right  to  convert  is  a  valuable  right  to  the  Holder.   The  damages
resulting  from  a  failure,  attempt
to  frustrate,  interference  with  such  conversion  right  are  difficult  if
not  impossible  to  qualify.
Accordingly  the  parties  acknowledge  that  the  liquidated  damages
provision  contained  in  this
Section 1.4(h) are justified.

                 (i)   Rescindment  of  a  Notice  of  Conversion.   If  (i)
the  Borrower  fails
to  respond  to  Holder  within  one  (1)  business  day  from  the  Conversion
Date  confirming  the
details  of  Notice  of  Conversion,  (ii)  the  Borrower  fails  to  provide
any  of  the  shares  of  the
Borrower's Common Stock requested in the Notice of Conversion within three (3)
business days
from  the  date  of  receipt  of  the  Note  of  Conversion,  (iii)  the  Holder
is  unable  to  procure  a  legal
opinion  required  to  have  the  shares  of  the  Borrower's  Common  Stock
issued  unrestricted  and/or
deposited  to  sell  for  any  reason  related  to  the  Borrower's  standing,
(iv)  the  Holder  is  unable  to

7

deposit  the  shares  of  the  Borrower's  Common  Stock  requested  in  the
Notice  of  Conversion  for
any  reason  related  to  the  Borrower's  standing,  (v)  at  any  time  after
a  missed  Deadline,  at  the
Holder's  sole  discretion,  or  (vi)  if  OTC  Markets  changes  the
Borrower's  designation  to  `Limited
Information'  (Yield),  `No  Information'  (Stop  Sign),  `Caveat  Emptor'
(Skull  &  Crossbones),
`OTC',  `Other  OTC'  or  `Grey  Market'  (Exclamation  Mark  Sign)  or  other
trading  restriction  on
the  day  of  or  any  day  after  the  Conversion  Date,  the  Holder
maintains  the  option  and  sole
discretion to rescind the Notice of Conversion ("Rescindment") with a "Notice of
Rescindment."

           1.5 Concerning   the   Shares.      The   shares   of   Common
Stock   issuable   upon
conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless   (i) such shares
are sold pursuant to
an  effective  registration  statement  under  the  Act  or  (ii)  the  Borrower
or  its  transfer  agent  shall
have  been  furnished  with  an  opinion  of   counsel  (which  opinion  shall
be  in  form,  substance  and
scope  customary  for  opinions  of  counsel  in  comparable  transactions)  to
the  effect  that  the  shares
to  be  sold  or  transferred  may  be  sold  or  transferred  pursuant  to  an
exemption  from  such
registration  or  (iii) such  shares  are  sold  or  transferred  pursuant  to
Rule  144  under  the  Act  (or  a
successor  rule)  ("Rule  144")  or  (iv)  such  shares  are  transferred  to
an  "affiliate"  (as  defined  in
Rule 144)  of  the Borrower  who  agrees  to  sell or  otherwise transfer  the
shares  only  in  accordance
with  this  Section  1.5  and  who  is  an  Accredited  Investor  (as  defined
in  the  Purchase  Agreement).
Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  the  Purchase  Agreement  (and  subject  to
the  removal  provisions
set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this
Note  have  been  registered  under  the  Act  or  otherwise  may  be  sold
pursuant  to  Rule  144  without
any  restriction  as  to  the  number  of  securities  as  of  a  particular
date  that  can  then  be  immediately
sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
this Note that has
not  been  so  included  in  an  effective  registration  statement  or  that
has  not  been  sold  pursuant  to
an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the
legend, shall bear
a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate:

"NEITHER      THE      ISSUANCE      AND      SALE      OF      THE
SECURITIES
      REPRESENTED   BY   THIS   CERTIFICATE   NOR   THE   SECURITIES   INTO
      WHICH      THESE      SECURITIES      ARE      EXERCISABLE      HAVE
BEEN
      REGISTERED  UNDER  THE  SECURITIES  ACT  OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED,  OR
      APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS.   THE  SECURITIES  MAY  NOT  BE
      OFFERED   FOR   SALE,   SOLD,   TRANSFERRED   OR   ASSIGNED   (I)   IN
THE
      ABSENCE  OF  (A)  AN  EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION  STATEMENT  FOR  THE
      SECURITIES  UNDER  THE  SECURITIES  ACT  OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED,  OR  (B)
      AN  OPINION  OF  COUNSEL  (WHICH  COUNSEL  SHALL  BE  SELECTED  BY
      THE     HOLDER),     IN     A     GENERALLY     ACCEPTABLE     FORM,
THAT
      REGISTRATION   IS   NOT   REQUIRED   UNDER   SAID   ACT   OR   (II)
UNLESS
      SOLD   PURSUANT   TO   RULE   144   OR   RULE   144A   UNDER   SAID   ACT.
      NOTWITHSTANDING    THE    FOREGOING,    THE    SECURITIES    MAY    BE
      PLEDGED  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  A  BONA  FIDE  MARGIN  ACCOUNT  OR
      OTHER    LOAN    OR    FINANCING    ARRANGEMENT    SECURED    BY    THE
      SECURITIES."

           The  legend  set  forth  above  shall  be  removed  and  the
Borrower  shall  issue  to  the
Holder  a  new  certificate  therefore  free  of  any  transfer  legend  if  (i)
the  Borrower  or  its  transfer
agent  shall  have  received  an  opinion  of  counsel,  in  form,  substance
and  scope  customary  for
opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale
or transfer of such

8

Common   Stock   may   be   made   without   registration   under   the   Act,
which   opinion   shall   be
reasonably  accepted  by  the  Borrower  so  that  the  sale  or  transfer  is
effected  or  (ii)  in  the  case  of
the  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  this  Note,  such  security
is  registered  for  sale  by
the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or
otherwise may be sold
pursuant  to  Rule  144  without  any  restriction  as  to  the  number  of
securities  as  of  a  particular  date
that  can  then  be  immediately  sold.  In  the  event  that  the  Borrower
does  not  accept  the  opinion  of
counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities
pursuant to an exemption
from  registration,  such  as  Rule  144  or  Regulation  S,  at  the  Deadline,
it  will  be  considered  an
Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note.

           1.6 Effect of Certain Events.

                 (a)  Effect  of  Merger,  Consolidation,  Etc.   At  the
option  of  the  Holder,  the
sale,  conveyance  or  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the
assets  of  the  Borrower,  the
effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions
in which more than
50%  of  the  voting  power  of  the  Borrower  is  disposed  of,  or  the
consolidation,  merger  or  other
business  combination  of  the  Borrower  with  or  into  any  other  Person
(as  defined  below)  or
Persons  when  the  Borrower  is  not  the  survivor  shall  either:  (i)  be
deemed  to  be  an  Event  of
Default  (as  defined  in  Article  III)  pursuant  to  which  the  Borrower
shall  be  required  to  pay  to  the
Holder  upon  the  consummation  of  and  as  a  condition  to  such
transaction  an  amount  equal  to  the
Default  Amount  (as  defined  in  Article  III)  or  (ii)  be  treated
pursuant  to  Section  1.6(b)  hereof.
"Person"   shall   mean   any   individual,   corporation,   limited   liability
company,   partnership,
association, trust or other entity or organization.

                 (b)  Adjustment  Due  to  Merger,  Consolidation,  Etc.   If,
at  any  time  when
this  Note  is  issued  and  outstanding  and  prior  to  conversion  of  all
of  the  Notes,  there  shall  be  any
merger,   consolidation,   exchange   of   shares,   recapitalization,
reorganization,   or   other   similar
event,  as  a  result  of  which  shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the  Borrower
shall  be  changed  into  the
same  or  a  different  number  of  shares  of  another  class  or  classes  of
stock  or  securities  of  the
Borrower  or  another  entity,  or  in  case  of  any  sale  or  conveyance  of
all  or  substantially  all  of  the
assets  of  the  Borrower  other  than  in  connection  with  a  plan  of
complete  liquidation  of  the
Borrower,  then  the  Holder  of  this  Note  shall  thereafter  have  the
right  to  receive  upon  conversion
of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein
and in lieu of the
shares   of   Common   Stock   immediately   theretofore   issuable   upon
conversion,   such   stock,
securities  or  assets  which  the  Holder  would  have  been  entitled  to
receive  in  such  transaction  had
this  Note  been  converted  in  full  immediately  prior  to  such  transaction
(without  regard  to  any
limitations  on  conversion  set  forth  herein),  and  in  any  such  case
appropriate  provisions  shall  be
made  with  respect  to  the  rights  and  interests  of  the  Holder  of  this
Note  to  the  end  that  the
provisions  hereof  (including,  without  limitation,  provisions  for
adjustment  of  the  Conversion
Price  and  of  the  number  of  shares  issuable  upon  conversion  of  the
Note)  shall  thereafter  be
applicable,  as  nearly  as  may  be  practicable  in  relation  to  any
securities  or  assets  thereafter
deliverable  upon  the  conversion  hereof.   The  Borrower  shall  not  affect
any  transaction  described
in  this  Section  1.6(b)  unless  (a)  it  first  gives,  to  the  extent
practicable,  thirty  (30)  days  prior
written  notice  (but  in  any  event  at  least  fifteen  (15)  days  prior
written  notice)  of  the  record  date
of  the  special  meeting  of  shareholders  to  approve,  or  if  there  is  no
such  record  date,  the
consummation    of,    such    merger,    consolidation,    exchange    of
shares,    recapitalization,

9

reorganization  or  other  similar  event  or  sale  of  assets  (during  which
time  the  Holder  shall  be
entitled  to  convert  this  Note)  and  (b)  the  resulting  successor  or
acquiring  entity  (if  not  the
Borrower)  assumes  by  written  instrument  the  obligations  of  this  Section
1.6(b).    The  above
provisions  shall  similarly  apply  to  successive  consolidations,  mergers,
sales,  transfers  or  share
exchanges.

                 (c)  Adjustment Due to Distribution.  If the Borrower shall
declare or make
any  distribution  of  its  assets  (or  rights  to  acquire  its  assets)  to
holders  of  Common  Stock  as  a
dividend,  stock  repurchase,  by  way  of  return  of  capital  or  otherwise
(including  any  dividend  or
distribution  to  the  Borrower's  shareholders  in  cash  or  shares  (or
rights  to  acquire  shares)  of
capital  stock  of  a  subsidiary  (i.e.,  a  spin-off))  (a  "Distribution"),
then  the  Holder  of  this  Note
shall  be  entitled,  upon  any  conversion  of  this  Note  after  the  date
of  record  for  determining
shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets
which would have
been  payable  to  the  Holder  with  respect  to  the  shares  of  Common
Stock  issuable  upon  such
conversion  had  such  Holder  been  the  holder  of  such  shares  of  Common
Stock  on  the  record  date
for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.

                 (d)  Adjustment  Due  to  Dilutive  Issuance.   If,  at  any
time  when  any  Notes
are issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with
this Section 1.6(d)
hereof  is  deemed  to  have  issued  or  sold,  except  for  shares  of  Common
Stock  issued  directly  to
vendors  or  suppliers  of  the  Borrower  in  satisfaction  of  amounts  owed
to  such  vendors  or
suppliers  (provided,  however,  that  such  vendors  or  suppliers  shall  not
have  an  arrangement  to
transfer,  sell  or  assign  such  shares  of  Common  Stock  prior  to  the
issuance  of  such  shares),  any
shares  of  Common  Stock  for  no  consideration  or  for  a  consideration
per  share  (before  deduction
of  reasonable  expenses  or  commissions  or  underwriting  discounts  or
allowances  in  connection
therewith)  less  than  the  Conversion  Price  in  effect  on  the  date  of
such  issuance  (or  deemed
issuance)  of  such  shares  of  Common  Stock  (a  "Dilutive  Issuance"),  then
immediately  upon  the
Dilutive  Issuance,  the  Conversion  Price  will  be  reduced  to  the  amount
of  the  consideration  per
share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance.

                 The  Borrower  shall  be  deemed  to  have  issued  or  sold
shares  of  Common
Stock  if  the  Borrower  in  any  manner  issues  or  grants  any  warrants,
rights  or  options  (not
including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable,
to subscribe for
or  to  purchase  Common  Stock  or  other  securities  convertible  into  or
exchangeable  for  Common
Stock  ("Convertible  Securities")  (such  warrants,  rights  and  options  to
purchase  Common  Stock
or  Convertible  Securities  are  hereinafter  referred  to  as  "Options")  and
the  price  per  share  for
which  Common  Stock  is  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  such  Options  is
less  than  the  Conversion
Price  then  in  effect,  then  the  Conversion  Price  shall  be  equal  to
such  price  per  share.    For
purposes  of  the  preceding  sentence,  the  "price  per  share  for  which
Common  Stock  is  issuable
upon  the  exercise  of  such  Options"  is  determined  by  dividing  (i)  the
total  amount,  if  any,
received  or  receivable  by  the  Borrower  as  consideration  for  the
issuance  or  granting  of  all  such
Options,  plus  the  minimum  aggregate  amount  of  additional  consideration,
if  any,  payable  to  the
Borrower  upon  the  exercise  of  all  such  Options,  plus,  in  the  case  of
Convertible  Securities
issuable   upon   the   exercise   of   such   Options,   the   minimum
aggregate   amount   of   additional
consideration  payable  upon  the  conversion  or  exchange  thereof  at  the
time  such  Convertible
Securities  first  become  convertible  or  exchangeable,  by  (ii)  the
maximum  total  number  of  shares

10

of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  all  such  Options
(assuming  full  conversion  of
Convertible  Securities,  if  applicable).    No  further  adjustment  to  the
Conversion  Price  will  be
made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon the exercise of such
Options or upon
the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
such Options.

                 Additionally,  the  Borrower  shall  be  deemed  to  have
issued  or  sold  shares
of  Common  Stock  if  the  Borrower  in  any  manner  issues  or  sells  any
Convertible  Securities,
whether  or  not  immediately  convertible  (other  than  where  the  same  are
issuable  upon  the
exercise  of  Options),  and  the  price  per  share  for  which  Common  Stock
is  issuable  upon  such
conversion  or  exchange  is  less  than  the  Conversion  Price  then  in
effect,  then  the  Conversion
Price  shall  be  equal  to  such  price  per  share.    For  the  purposes  of
the  preceding  sentence,  the
"price  per  share  for  which  Common  Stock  is  issuable  upon  such
conversion  or  exchange"  is
determined  by  dividing  (i)  the  total  amount,  if  any,  received  or
receivable  by  the  Borrower  as
consideration  for  the  issuance  or  sale  of  all  such  Convertible
Securities,  plus  the  minimum
aggregate   amount   of   additional   consideration,   if   any,   payable   to
the   Borrower   upon   the
conversion  or  exchange  thereof  at  the  time  such  Convertible  Securities
first  become  convertible
or  exchangeable,  by  (ii)  the  maximum  total  number  of  shares  of  Common
Stock  issuable  upon
the  conversion  or  exchange  of  all  such  Convertible  Securities.    No
further  adjustment  to  the
Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon
conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

                 (e)  Purchase  Rights.    If,  at  any  time  when  any  Notes
are  issued  and
outstanding,  the  Borrower  issues  any  convertible  securities  or  rights
to  purchase  stock,  warrants,
securities  or  other  property  (the  "Purchase  Rights")  pro  rata  to  the
record  holders  of  any  class  of
Common   Stock,   then   the   Holder   of   this   Note   will   be   entitled
to   acquire,   upon   the   terms
applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such
Holder could have
acquired  if  such  Holder  had  held  the  number  of  shares  of  Common
Stock  acquirable  upon
complete  conversion  of  this  Note  (without  regard  to  any  limitations  on
conversion  contained
herein)  immediately  before  the  date  on  which  a  record  is  taken  for
the  grant,  issuance  or  sale  of
such  Purchase  Rights  or,  if  no  such  record  is  taken,  the  date  as  of
which  the  record  holders  of
Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase
Rights.

                 (f)  Notice  of  Adjustments.    Upon  the  occurrence  of
each  adjustment  or
readjustment  of  the  Conversion  Price  as  a  result  of  the  events
described  in  this  Section  1.6,  the
Borrower,  at  its  expense,  shall  promptly  compute  such  adjustment  or
readjustment  and  prepare
and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and  showing
in  detail  the  facts  upon  which  such  adjustment  or  readjustment  is
based.   The  Borrower  shall,
upon  the  written  request  at  any  time  of  the  Holder,  furnish  to  such
Holder  a  like  certificate
setting  forth  (i)  such  adjustment  or  readjustment,  (ii)  the  Conversion
Price  at  the  time  in  effect
and  (iii)  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  and  the  amount,  if
any,  of  other  securities  or
property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.

           1.7 Trading  Market  Limitations.  Unless  permitted  by  the
applicable  rules  and
regulations  of  the  principal  securities  market  on  which  the  Common
Stock  is  then  listed  or
traded,  in  no  event  shall  the  Borrower  issue  upon  conversion  of  or
otherwise  pursuant  to  this
Note  and  the  other  Notes  issued  pursuant  to  the  Purchase  Agreement
more  than  the  maximum

11

number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  that  the  Borrower  can  issue  pursuant
to  any  rule  of  the
principal  United  States  securities  market  on  which  the  Common  Stock  is
then  traded  (the
"Maximum Share Amount"), which shall be 4.99% of the total shares outstanding on
the Closing
Date  (as  defined  in  the  Purchase  Agreement),  subject  to  equitable
adjustment  from  time  to  time
for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and
similar events relating
to  the  Common  Stock  occurring  after  the  date  hereof.   Once  the
Maximum  Share  Amount  has
been  issued,  if  the  Borrower  fails  to  eliminate  any  prohibitions  under
applicable  law  or  the  rules
or  regulations  of  any  stock  exchange,  interdealer  quotation  system  or
other  self-regulatory
organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its securities on the
Borrower's ability
to  issue  shares  of  Common  Stock  in  excess  of  the  Maximum  Share
Amount,  in  lieu  of  any
further  right  to  convert  this  Note,  this  will  be  considered  an  Event
of  Default  under  Section  3.2
of the Note.

           1.8 Status  as  Shareholder.    Upon  submission  of  a  Notice  of
Conversion  by  a
Holder,  (i)  the  shares  covered  thereby  (other  than  the  shares,  if
any,  which  cannot  be  issued
because  their  issuance  would  exceed  such  Holder's  allocated  portion  of
the  Reserved  Amount  or
Maximum  Share  Amount)  shall  be  deemed  converted  into  shares  of  Common
Stock  and  (ii)  the
Holder's  rights  as  a  Holder  of  such  converted  portion  of  this  Note
shall  cease  and  terminate,
excepting  only  the  right  to  receive  certificates  for  such  shares  of
Common  Stock  and  to  any
remedies  provided  herein  or  otherwise  available  at  law  or  in  equity
to  such  Holder  because  of  a
failure  by  the  Borrower  to  comply  with  the  terms   of  this  Note.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
if  a  Holder  has  not  received  certificates  for  all  shares  of  Common
Stock  prior  to  the  tenth  (10th)
business  day  after  the  expiration  of  the  Deadline  with  respect  to  a
conversion  of  any  portion  of
this  Note  for  any  reason,  then  (unless  the  Holder  otherwise  elects  to
retain  its  status  as  a  holder
of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights
of a Holder of
this  Note  with  respect  to  such  unconverted  portions  of  this  Note  and
the  Borrower  shall,  as  soon
as   practicable,   return   such   unconverted   Note   to   the   Holder   or,
if   the   Note   has   not   been
surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has
not been converted.  In
all  cases,  the  Holder  shall  retain  all  of  its  rights  and  remedies
(including,  without  limitation,  (i)
the  right  to  receive  Conversion  Default  Payments  pursuant  to  Section
1.3  to  the  extent  required
thereby  for  such  Conversion  Default  and  any  subsequent  Conversion
Default  and  (ii)  the  right  to
have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined in
accordance with
Section 1.3) for the Borrower's failure to convert this Note.

           1.9 Prepayment.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Note,
the  Borrower  may  prepay  the  amounts  outstanding  hereunder  pursuant  to
the  following  terms
and conditions:

                 (a)  At  any  time  during  the  period  beginning  on  the

Holder of the Note
to  prepay  the  outstanding  Note  (principal  and  accrued  interest),  in
full  by  making  a  payment  to
the  Holder  of  an  amount  in  cash  equal  to  125%,  multiplied  by  the
sum  of:  (w)  the  then
outstanding  principal  amount  of  this  Note  plus  (x) accrued  and  unpaid
interest  on  the  unpaid
principal amount of this Note plus (y) Default Interest, if any.

12

(b)  At  any  time  during  the  period  beginning  the  day
which  is  ninety  one
(91)  days  following  the  Issue  Date  and  ending  on  the  date  which  is
one  hundred  eighty  (180)
days  following  the  Issue  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  have  the  right,
exercisable  on  not  less  than
three  (3)  Trading  Days  prior  written  notice  to  the  Holder  of  the
Note  to  prepay  the  outstanding
Note  (principal  and  accrued  interest),  in  full  by  making  a  payment  to
the  Holder  of  an  amount  in
cash  equal  to  135%,  multiplied  by  the  sum  of:  (w)  the  then
outstanding  principal  amount  of  this
Note  plus  (x) accrued  and  unpaid  interest  on  the  unpaid  principal
amount  of  this  Note  plus  (y)
Default Interest, if any.

                 (c)  After  the  expiration  of  one  hundred  eighty  (180)
days  following  the
date of the Note, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment.

Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an "Optional Prepayment Notice") shall be
delivered to the
Holder  of  the  Note  at  its  registered  addresses  and  shall  state:  (1)
that  the  Borrower  is  exercising
its  right  to  prepay  the  Note,  and  (2)  the  date  of  prepayment  which
shall  be  not  more  than  three
(3)  Trading  Days  from  the  date  of  the  Optional  Prepayment  Notice.
On  the  date  fixed  for
prepayment   (the   "Optional   Prepayment   Date"),   the   Borrower   shall
make   payment   of   the
applicable  prepayment  amount  to  or  upon  the  order  of  the  Holder  as
specified  by  the  Holder  in
writing  to  the  Borrower  at  least  one  (1)  business  day  prior  to  the
Optional  Prepayment  Date.   If
the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the
applicable prepayment
amount  due  to  the  Holder  of  the  Note  within  two  (2)  business  days
following  the  Optional
Prepayment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  forever  forfeit  its  right  to
prepay  the  Note  pursuant  to  this
Section 1.9.

agrees   that   the
Borrower  will  not,  by  amendment  of  its  Certificate  or  Articles  of

                      ARTICLE III.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT

14

If any of the following events of default (each, an "Event of
Default") shall occur:

           3.1 Failure  to  Pay  Principal  or  Interest.   The  Borrower  fails
to  pay  the  principal
hereof  or  interest  thereon  when  due  on  this  Note,  whether  at
maturity,  upon  acceleration  or
otherwise.

           3.2 Conversion  and  the  Shares.   The  Borrower  fails  to  issue
shares  of  Common
Stock  to  the  Holder  (or  announces  or  threatens  in  writing  that  it
will  not  honor  its  obligation  to
do  so)  upon  exercise by  the  Holder  of  the conversion  rights  of  the
Holder  in  accordance with  the
terms  of  this  Note,  fails  to  transfer  or  cause  its  transfer  agent  to
transfer  (issue)  (electronically  or
in  certificated  form)  any  certificate  for  shares  of  Common  Stock
issued  to  the  Holder  upon
conversion  of  or  otherwise  pursuant  to  this  Note  as  and  when  required
by  this  Note,  the
Borrower  directs  its  transfer  agent  not  to  transfer  or  delays,
impairs,  and/or  hinders  its  transfer
agent  in  transferring  (or  issuing)  (electronically  or  in  certificated
form)  any  certificate  for  shares
of  Common  Stock  to  be  issued  to  the  Holder  upon  conversion  of  or
otherwise  pursuant  to  this
Note  as  and  when  required  by  this  Note,  or  fails  to  remove  (or
directs  its  transfer  agent  not  to
remove  or  impairs,  delays,  and/or  hinders  its  transfer  agent  from
removing)  any  restrictive
legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect thereof) on any
certificate for any
shares  of  Common  Stock  issued  to  the  Holder  upon  conversion  of  or
otherwise  pursuant  to  this
Note as and when required by this Note (or makes any written announcement,
statement or threat
that  it  does  not  intend  to  honor  the  obligations  described  in  this
paragraph)  and  any  such  failure
shall  continue  uncured  (or  any  written  announcement,  statement  or
threat  not  to  honor  its
obligations  shall  not  be  rescinded  in  writing)  for  three  (3)  business
days  after  the  Holder  shall
have  delivered  a  Notice  of  Conversion.   It  is  an  obligation  of  the
Borrower  to  remain  current  in
its  obligations  to  its  transfer  agent.  It  shall  be  an  event  of
default  of  this  Note,  if  a  conversion  of
this  Note  is  delayed,  hindered  or  frustrated  due  to  a  balance  owed
by  the  Borrower  to  its  transfer
agent.  If  at  the  option  of  the  Holder,  the  Holder  advances  any  funds
to  the  Borrower's  transfer
agent in order to process a conversion, such advanced funds shall be paid by the
Borrower to the
Holder within forty eight (48) hours of a demand from the Holder.

           3.3 Failure   to   Deliver   Transaction   Expense   Amount.     The
Borrower   fails   to
deliver  the  Transaction  Expense  Amount  (as  defined  in  the  Purchase
Agreement)  to  the  Holder
within three (3) business days of the date such amount is due.

           3.4 Breach  of  Covenants.   The  Borrower  breaches  any  material
covenant  or  other
material  term  or  condition  contained  in  this  Note  and  any  collateral
documents  including  but  not
limited  to  the  Purchase  Agreement  and  such  breach  continues  for  a
period  of  ten  (10)  days  after
written notice thereof to the Borrower from the Holder.

           3.5 Breach  of  Representations  and  Warranties.   Any
representation  or  warranty  of
the Borrower made herein or in any agreement, statement or certificate given in
writing pursuant
hereto  or  in  connection  herewith  (including,  without  limitation,  the
Purchase  Agreement),  shall
be  false  or  misleading  in  any  material  respect  when  made  and  the
breach  of  which  has  (or  with
the passage of time will have) a material adverse effect on the rights of the
Holder with respect to
this Note or the Purchase Agreement.

15

3.6 Receiver  or  Trustee.   The  Borrower  or  any  subsidiary  of
the  Borrower  shall
make  an  assignment  for  the  benefit  of  creditors  or  commence
proceedings  for  its  dissolution,  or
apply  for  or  consent  to  the  appointment  of  a  receiver  or  trustee  for
it  or  for  a  substantial  part  of
its  property  or  business,  or  such  a  receiver  or  trustee  shall
otherwise  be  appointed  for  the
Borrower  or  for  a  substantial  part  of  its  property  or  business
without  its  consent  and  shall  not  be
discharged within sixty (60) days after such appointment.

property or other assets
for more than $50,000, and shall remain unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a
period of twenty
(20)  days  unless  otherwise  consented  to  by  the  Holder,  which  consent
will  not  be  unreasonably
withheld.

           3.8 Bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy,    insolvency,    reorganization    or
liquidation
proceedings  or  other  proceedings,  voluntary  or  involuntary,  for  relief
under  any  bankruptcy  law
or  any  law  for  the  relief  of  debtors  shall  be  instituted  by  or
against  the  Borrower  or  any
subsidiary  of  the  Borrower,  or  the  Borrower  admits  in  writing  its

maintain  any  material

financial
statements filed by the Borrower with the SEC for any date or period from two
years prior to the

to  the  Holder,  in  full  satisfaction  of  its  obligations  hereunder,  an

Borrower  by  such  Holders  (the  "Default  Notice"),  and  upon  the
occurrence  of  an  Event  of
Default  specified  the  remaining  sections  of  Article  III  (other  than
failure  to  pay  the  principal
hereof  or  interest  thereon  at  the  Maturity  Date  specified  in  Section
3,1  hereof),  the  Note  shall
become   immediately   due   and   payable   and   the   Borrower   shall   pay
to   the   Holder,   in   full
satisfaction  of  its  obligations  hereunder,  an  amount  equal  to  (i)  130%
times  the  sum  of  (w)  the
then outstanding principal amount of this Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid
interest on the unpaid
principal  amount  of  this  Note  to  the  date  of  payment  (the  "Mandatory
Prepayment  Date")  plus
(y)  Default  Interest,  if  any,  on  the  amounts  referred  to  in  clauses
(w)  and/or  (x)  plus  (z)  any
amounts  owed  to  the  Holder  pursuant  to  Sections  1.3  and  1.4(g)  hereof
(the  then  outstanding
principal  amount  of  this  Note  to  the  date  of  payment  plus  the
amounts  referred  to  in  clauses  (x),
(y)  and  (z)  shall  collectively  be  known  as  the  "Default  Sum")  or
(ii)  at  the  option  of  the  Holder,
the  "parity  value"  of  the  Default  Sum  to  be  prepaid,  where  parity
value  means  (a)  the  highest
number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  or
otherwise  pursuant  to  such
Default  Sum  in  accordance  with  Article  I,  treating  the  Trading  Day
immediately  preceding  the
Mandatory  Prepayment  Date  as  the  "Conversion  Date"  for  purposes  of
determining  the  lowest
applicable Conversion Price, unless the Default Event arises as a result of a
breach in respect of a
specific  Conversion  Date  in  which  case  such  Conversion  Date  shall  be
the  Conversion  Date),
multiplied  by  (b)  the  highest  Trading  Price  for  the  Common  Stock
during  the  period  beginning
on the date of first occurrence of the Event of Default and ending one day prior
to the Mandatory
Prepayment   Date   (the   "Default   Amount")   and   all   other   amounts
payable   hereunder   shall
immediately  become  due  and  payable,  all  without  demand,  presentment  or
notice,  all  of  which
hereby  are  expressly  waived,  together  with  all  costs,  including,
without  limitation,  legal  fees  and
expenses,  of  collection,  and  the  Holder  shall  be  entitled  to  exercise
all  other  rights  and  remedies
available  at  law  or  in  equity.   Further,  if  a  breach  of  Sections
3.9,  3.10  and/or  3.19  occurs  or  is
continuing after the six (6) month anniversary of this Note, then the principal
amount of the Note
shall  increase  by  Fifteen  Thousand  and  No/100  United  States  Dollars
($15,000)  (under  Holder's
and  Borrower's  expectation  that  any  principal  amount  increase  will  tack
back  to  the  Issue  Date)
and  the  Holder  shall  be  entitled  to  use  the  lowest  Trading  Price
during  the  delinquency  period  as
a  base  price  for  the  conversion  with  the  Variable  Conversion  Price
shall  be  redefined  to  mean
forty  percent  (40%)  multiplied  by  the  Market  Price,  subject  to
adjustment  as  provided  in  this
Note.  For  example,  if  the  lowest  Trading  Price  during  the  delinquency
period  is  $0.01  per  share
and  the  conversion  discount  is  50%,  then  the  Holder  may  elect  to
convert  future  conversions  at
$0.005  per  share.   If  this  Note  is  not  paid  at  Maturity  Date,  then
the  outstanding  principal  due
under this Note shall increase by Fifteen Thousand and No/100 United States
Dollars ($15,000).

18

If  the  Borrower  fails  to  pay  the  Default  Amount  within  five  (5)
business  days  of  written  notice
that  such  amount  is  due  and  payable,  then  the  Holder  shall  have  the
right  at  any  time,  so  long  as
the Borrower remains in default (and so long and to the extent that there are
sufficient authorized
shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in
lieu of  the Default
Amount,  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the  Borrower  equal
to  the  Default  Amount
divided   by   the   Conversion   Price   then   in   effect.     This
requirement   by   the   Borrower   shall
automatically apply upon the occurrence of an Event of Default without the need
for any party to
give any notice or take any other action.

If  the  Holder  shall  commence  an  action  or  proceeding  to  enforce  any
provisions  of  this  Note,
including, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if the Holder prevails
in such action, the
Holder  shall  be  reimbursed  by  the  Borrower  for  its  attorneys'  fees
and  other  costs  and  expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding.

the   Borrower   and   its

of laws.  Any action

20

brought  by  either  party  against  the  other  concerning  the  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Note
shall  be  brought  only  in  the  state  courts  of  Massachusetts  or  in  the
federal  courts  located  in  the
Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts.     The  parties  to  this  Note  hereby
irrevocably  waive  any
objection  to  jurisdiction  and  venue  of  any  action  instituted  hereunder
and  shall  not  assert  any
defense  based  on  lack  of  jurisdiction  or  venue  or  based  upon  forum
non  conveniens.    THE
BORROWER  HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES  ANY  RIGHT  IT  MAY  HAVE  TO,
AND  AGREES  NOT  TO  REQUEST,  A  JURY  TRIAL  FOR  THE  ADJUDICATION  OF
ANY  DISPUTE  HEREUNDER  OR  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  OR  ARISING  OUT  OF
THIS  NOTE  OR  ANY  TRANSACTION  CONTEMPLATED  HEREBY.    The  prevailing

the event that any provision of this Note or any other agreement delivered in
connection herewith
is  invalid  or  unenforceable  under  any  applicable  statute  or  rule  of
law,  then  such  provision  shall
be  deemed  inoperative  to  the  extent  that  it  may  conflict  therewith
and  shall  be  deemed  modified
to  conform  with  such  statute  or  rule  of  law.   Any  such  provision
which  may  prove  invalid  or
unenforceable  under  any  law  shall  not  affect  the  validity  or
enforceability  of  any  other  provision
of  any  agreement.      Each  party  hereby  irrevocably  waives  personal
service  of  process  and
consents  to  process  being  served  in  any  suit,  action  or  proceeding  in
connection  with  this
Agreement  or  any  other  Transaction  Document  by  mailing  a  copy  thereof

           4.7 Certain Amounts.  Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is
required to
pay  an  amount  in  excess  of  the  outstanding  principal  amount  (or  the
portion  thereof  required  to
be  paid  at  that  time)  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  plus  Default
Interest  on  such  interest,  the
Borrower  and  the  Holder  agree  that  the  actual  damages  to  the  Holder
from  the  receipt  of  cash
payment  on  this  Note  may  be  difficult  to  determine  and  the  amount  to
be  so  paid  by  the
Borrower  represents  stipulated  damages  and  not  a  penalty  and  is
intended  to  compensate  the
Holder  in  part  for  loss  of  the  opportunity  to  convert  this  Note  and
to  earn  a  return  from  the  sale
of  shares  of  Common  Stock  acquired  upon  conversion  of  this  Note  at  a
price  in  excess  of  the
price  paid  for  such  shares  pursuant  to  this  Note.   The  Borrower  and
the  Holder  hereby  agree  that
such  amount  of  stipulated  damages  is  not  plainly  disproportionate  to
the  possible  loss  to  the
Holder  from  the  receipt  of  a  cash  payment  without  the  opportunity  to
convert  this  Note  into
shares of Common Stock.

           4.8 Purchase  Agreement.   By  its  acceptance  of  this  Note,  each
party  agrees  to  be
bound by the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.

           4.9 Notice  of  Corporate  Events.   Except  as  otherwise  provided
below,  the  Holder
of this Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to
the extent that
it  converts  this  Note  into  Common  Stock.  The  Borrower  shall  provide
the  Holder  with  prior
notification  of  any  meeting  of  the  Borrower's  shareholders  (and  copies
of  proxy  materials  and
other  information  sent  to  shareholders).   In  the  event  of  any  taking
by  the  Borrower  of  a  record
of  its  shareholders  for  the  purpose  of  determining  shareholders  who
are  entitled  to  receive
payment  of  any  dividend  or  other  distribution,  any  right  to  subscribe
for,  purchase  or  otherwise

21

acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification or
recapitalization) any share
of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right,
or for the purpose of
determining  shareholders  who  are  entitled  to  vote  in  connection  with
any  proposed  sale,  lease  or
conveyance  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  the  Borrower
or  any  proposed  liquidation,
dissolution  or  winding  up  of  the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  shall  mail  a
notice  to  the  Holder,  at
least  twenty  (20)  days  prior  to  the  record  date  specified  therein  (or
thirty  (30)  days  prior  to  the
consummation  of  the  transaction  or  event,  whichever  is  earlier),  of
the  date  on  which  any  such
record  is  to  be  taken  for  the  purpose  of  such  dividend,  distribution,
right  or  other  event,  and  a
brief  statement  regarding  the  amount  and  character  of  such  dividend,
distribution,  right  or  other
event to the extent known at such time.   The Borrower shall make a public
announcement of any
event   requiring   notification   to   the   Holder   hereunder   substantially
simultaneously   with   the
notification  to  the  Holder  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this
Section  4.9  including,  but  not
limited to, name changes, recapitalizations, etc. as soon as possible under law.

           4.10     Usury.  If  it  shall  be  found  that  any  interest  or
other  amount  deemed
interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the
applicable provision shall
automatically  be  revised  to  equal  the  maximum  rate  of  interest  or
other  amount  deemed  interest
permitted  under  applicable  law.  The  Borrower  covenants  (to  the  extent
that  it  may  lawfully  do
so)  that  it  will  not  seek  to  claim  or  take  advantage  of  any  law
that  would  prohibit  or  forgive  the
Borrower from paying all or a portion of the principal or interest on this Note.

           4.11     Remedies.     The   Borrower   acknowledges   that   a
breach   by   it   of   its
obligations  hereunder  will  cause  irreparable  harm  to  the  Holder,  by
vitiating  the  intent  and
purpose  of  the  transaction  contemplated  hereby.   Accordingly,  the
Borrower  acknowledges  that
the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be
inadequate and agrees, in
the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of
this Note, that the
Holder  shall  be  entitled,  in  addition  to  all  other  available  remedies
at  law  or  in  equity,  and  in
addition  to  the  penalties  assessable  herein,  to  an  injunction  or
injunctions  restraining,  preventing
or  curing  any  breach  of  this  Note  and  to  enforce  specifically  the
terms  and  provisions  thereof,
without  the  necessity  of  showing  economic  loss  and  without  any  bond
or  other  security  being
required.   No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of
the Borrower, which is
absolute  and  unconditional,  to  pay  the  principal  of,  and  interest  on,
this  Note  at  the  time,  place,
and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.

           4.12     Severability.    In  the  event  that  any  provision  of
this  Note  is  invalid  or
unenforceable  under  any  applicable  statute  or  rule  of  law,  then  such
provision  shall  be  deemed
inoperative  to  the  extent  that  it  may  conflict  therewith  and  shall  be
deemed  modified  to  conform
with such statute or rule of law.  Any provision hereof which may prove invalid
or unenforceable
under any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof.

           4.13     Dispute  Resolution.  In  the  case  of  a  dispute  as  to
the  determination  of  the
Conversion  Price,  Conversion  Amount,  any  prepayment  amount  or  Default
Amount,  Default
Sum, Closing or Maturity Date, the closing bid price, or fair market value (as
the case may be) or
the arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Price or the applicable prepayment
amount(s) (as the
case  may  be),  the  Borrower  or  the  Holder  shall  submit  the  disputed
determinations  or  arithmetic
calculations  via  facsimile  (i)  within  two  (2)  Business  Days  after
receipt  of  the  applicable  notice

22

giving  rise  to  such  dispute  to  the  Borrower  or  the  Holder  or  (ii)
if  no  notice  gave  rise  to  such
dispute,  at  any  time  after  the  Holder  learned  of  the  circumstances
giving  rise  to  such  dispute.  If
the  Holder  and  the  Borrower  are  unable  to  agree  upon  such
determination  or  calculation  within
two  (2)  Business  Days  of  such  disputed  determination  or  arithmetic
calculation  (as  the  case  may
be)  being  submitted  to  the  Borrower  or  the  Holder,  then  the  Borrower
shall,  within  two  (2)
Business  Days,  submit  via  facsimile  (a)  the  disputed  determination  of
the  Conversion  Price,  the
closing  bid  price,  the  or  fair  market  value  (as  the  case  may  be)  to
an  independent,  reputable
investment  bank  selected  by  the  Borrower  and  approved  by  the  Holder
or  (b)  the  disputed
arithmetic  calculation  of  the  Conversion  Price,  Conversion  Amount,  any
prepayment  amount  or
Default  Amount,  Default  Sum  to  an  independent,  outside  accountant
selected  by  the  Holder  that
is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. The Borrower shall cause at its
expense the investment
bank or the accountant to perform the determinations or calculations and notify
the Borrower and
the  Holder  of  the  results  no  later  than  ten  (10)  Business  Days  from
the  time  it  receives  such
disputed  determinations  or  calculations.  Such  investment  bank's  or
accountant's  determination
or calculation shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error.

           4.14     Terms of Future Financings.  So long as this Note is
outstanding, upon any
issuance  by  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  of  any  security
with  any  term  more  favorable
to  the  holder  of  such  security  or  with  a  term  in  favor  of  the
holder  of  such  security  that  was  not
similarly  provided  to  the  Holder  in  this  Note,  then  the  Borrower
shall  notify  the  Holder  of  such
additional  or  more  favorable  term  and  such  term,  at  Holder's  option,
shall  become  a  part  of  the
transaction  documents  with  the  Holder.   The  types  of  terms  contained
in  another  security  that
may  be  more  favorable  to  the  holder  of  such  security  include,  but
are  not  limited  to,  terms
addressing  conversion  discounts,  prepayment  rate,  conversion  lookback
periods,  interest  rates,
original   issue   discounts,   stock   sale   price,   private   placement
price   per   share,   and   warrant
coverage.

           4.15     Piggyback  Registration  Rights.   The  Borrower  shall
include  on  the  next
registration statement the Borrower files with SEC (or on the subsequent
registration statement if
such  registration  statement  is  withdrawn)  all  shares  issuable  upon
conversion  of  this  Note.
Failure  to  do  so  will  result  in  liquidated  damages  of  25%  of  the
outstanding  principal  balance  of
this  Note,  but  not  less  than  Fifteen  Thousand  and  No/100  United
States  Dollars  ($15,000),  being
immediately due and payable to the Holder at its election in the form of cash
payment or addition
to the balance of this Note.
