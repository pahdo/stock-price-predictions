  Note 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Form 10-Q instructions and in the opinion of management contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 of PolyOne Corporation. When used in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the terms  we,   us,   our , "PolyOne" and the  Company  mean PolyOne Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be attained in subsequent periods or for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, "  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  " (ASU 2016-13), which requires the allowance recorded for trade receivables to be measured by expected loss rather than incurred loss. Expected loss measurement will be based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 no later than the required date of January 1, 2020. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, "  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  " (ASU 2016-09), which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This update requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Income rather than additional paid-in capital. Additionally, the excess tax benefits will be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity, rather than a financing activity, on the Statement of Cash Flows. Further, the update allows an entity to make a policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively, with certain cumulative effect adjustments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 no later than the required date of January 1, 2017. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, "  Leases (Topic 842)  " (ASU 2016-02), which requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with a lease term of more than twelve months. Leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 no later than the required date of January 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11, "  Inventory (Topic 300): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  " (ASU 2015-11), which applies to inventory measured using first-in, first out (FIFO) or average cost. This update requires that an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  
   6 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Auditing Standards Update 2014-09, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  " (ASU 2014-09). Under this standard, a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 no later than the required date of January 1, 2018. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact this standard, along with the subsequent updates and clarifications, will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the method by which we will adopt the new standard. 
   
  Note 2   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS    
  On   July 26, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings, Inc. (Gordon Holdings) doing business as Gordon Composites, Inc. (Gordon Composites) and Polystrand, Inc. (Polystrand). Gordon Composites develops high strength profiles and laminates for use in vertical and crossbow archery, sports and recreation equipment, prosthetics and office furniture systems. Polystrand operates on the leading edge of continuous reinforced thermoplastic composite technology, a next generation material science that delivers the high strength and lightweight characteristics of composites, further enhanced with the design flexibility to form more complex shapes. 
  The purchase price was   $85.5 million   and the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the period subsequent to the date of the acquisition and are reported in the Specialty Engineered Materials segment. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change and not yet finalized. This preliminary allocation resulted in goodwill of   $36.6 million   and   $30.0 million   in intangible assets, of which   $4.0 million   represent indefinite-lived trade names. Goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. 
  On   January 29, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of certain technologies and assets from Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc. (Kraton), to expand its global footprint and expertise in thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) innovation and design, for approximately   $72.8 million  . The results of operations of Kraton are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the period subsequent to the date of the acquisition and are reported in the Specialty Engineered Materials segment. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change and not yet finalized. This preliminary allocation resulted in goodwill of   $37.7 million   and   $12.0 million   in intangible assets. Goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.  
  The definite-lived intangible assets that have been acquired with these recent acquisitions are being amortized over a period of   seven   to   twenty   years.  
   
  Note 3   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS     
  Goodwill as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:    

Indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets consisted of the following:

Note 4   EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS     
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized total employee separation and restructuring charges of   $4.6 million  , of which   $1.1 million   was recognized within   Cost of goods sold   and   $3.5 million   within   Selling and administrative expenses  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized total employee separation and restructuring charges of   $13.7 million  , of which   $11.6 million   was recognized within   Cost of goods sold   and   $2.1 million   within   Selling and administrative expenses. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized total employee separation and restructuring charges of   $16.5 million  , of which   $5.7 million   was recognized within   Cost of goods sold   and   $10.8 million   within   Selling and administrative expenses.   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized total employee separation and restructuring charges of   $31.8 million  , which included   $24.8 million   recognized within   Cost of goods sold   and   $7.0 million   recognized within   Selling and administrative expenses.  
  These charges are primarily associated with the current Designed Structures and Solutions (DSS) segment and the former Spartech Corporation (Spartech) businesses, which are further detailed below. 
  In the second half of 2015, PolyOne determined it would close   two   manufacturing facilities within the DSS segment and take other corporate actions to reduce administrative costs. These actions were taken as a result of the declining DSS results and near-term outlook. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized charges of   $2.5 million   and   $9.3 million  , respectively. During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized charges of   $10.5 million  . The costs recognized during 2016 and 2015 primarily related to severance and asset-related charges, including fixed asset and inventory write offs. Total costs for these actions to-date has been   $26.4 million  ,   which includes   $8.7 million   of severance costs,   $13.3 million   of asset-related charges, including accelerated depreciation of   $9.1 million  , and   $4.4 million   of other ongoing costs associated with exiting these plants and transferring equipment. Additional costs related to these actions are not expected to be material. 
  In 2013, PolyOne determined it would close   seven   former Spartech manufacturing facilities and   one   administrative office and relocate operations to other PolyOne facilities. The closure of these manufacturing facilities was part of the Company s efforts to improve service, on time delivery and quality as we align assets with our customers' needs. There were   no   charges related to the Spartech actions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as these actions were complete as of December 31, 2015. We recognized   $2.0 million   and   $17.0 million   related to these actions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

  Components of   Property, net   are as follows:    

Depreciation expense was   $61.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $63.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Included in depreciation expense is accelerated depreciation of   $3.3 million   and   $4.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, related to restructuring actions. 
   
  Note 7   INCOME TAXES    
  The income tax provision includes U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, the Company s effective tax rate was   24.3%   and   26.9%  , respectively, compared to   13.4%   and   15.7%  , respectively, for the comparable periods of 2015. 
  A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate is as follows: 

The effective tax rates for all periods differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the significant items described below. 
  2016 Significant items 
  The   3.3%   and   0.9%   benefits for uncertain tax positions for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily relate to the reversal of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a   1.7%   adjustment related to previously filed U.S. federal income tax returns and corresponding foreign tax credits resulted in the favorable impact to the effective tax rate. 
  
   9 

2015 Significant items 
  The   14.6%   benefit for uncertain tax positions for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to the reversal of an uncertain tax position due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The   0.4%   expense for uncertain tax positions for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an unfavorable foreign court ruling during the first quarter of 2015, which settled an uncertain tax position taken in a prior year, more than offsetting the benefit recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the   1.9%   and   18.1%   of respective benefits were a result of amending U.S. federal income tax returns from 2004 through 2012 to use foreign tax credits. 
   
  Note 8   WEIGHTED-AVERAGE SHARES USED IN COMPUTING EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE     

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,   0.2 million   equity-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   0.2 million   of equity-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.   No   equity-based awards were anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Note 10   FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS    
  Debt consists of the following instruments:   

On November 12, 2015, PolyOne entered into a senior secured term loan having an aggregate principal amount of   $550.0 million  .   One   percent of the principal amount is payable annually while the remaining balance matures on November 12, 2022. On June 15, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to its senior secured term loan. Under the terms of the amended senior secured term loan, the interest rate was reduced by 25 basis points to 275 basis points plus the greater of (i) the 1-, 2-, 3-, or 6-month LIBOR, at the Company's discretion, or (ii) 75 basis points. In connection with the amendment, the Company recognized   $0.4 million   of   Debt extinguishment costs   in our Consolidated Statements of Income. On August 3, 2016, the Company increased the senior secured term loan due 2022 by   $100.0 million   in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings. The weighted average annual interest rate for the senior secured term loan for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.50%   and   3.65%  , respectively. The total aggregate principal repayments as of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $4.4 million  . 
  PolyOne has outstanding   $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which mature on March 15, 2023. The senior notes bear an interest rate of   5.25%   per year, payable semi-annually, in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year.  
  The Company maintains a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 1, 2018, which provides a maximum borrowing facility size of   $400.0 million  , subject to a borrowing base with advances against certain U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable, inventory and other assets as specified in the agreement. We have the option to increase the availability under the facility to   $450.0 million  , subject to meeting certain requirements and obtaining commitments for such increase. The senior secured revolving credit facility has a U.S. and a Canadian line of credit. Currently there are   no   borrowings on the Canadian portion of the facility. Advances under the U.S. portion of our revolving credit facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at a Base Rate or a LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half percent, (ii) the prevailing LIBOR Rate plus one percent, and (iii) the prevailing Prime Rate. The applicable margins vary based on the Company s daily average excess availability during the previous quarter. The weighted average annual interest rate under this facility for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.00%   and   3.13%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding borrowings and had availability of   $381.7 million   under this facility.  
  
   11 

The agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our secured term loan, and the indentures and credit agreements governing other debt, contain a number of customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: consummate asset sales, incur additional debt or liens, consolidate or merge with any entity or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries, make capital investments and alter the business we conduct. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants.  
  The Company also has a credit line of   $16.0 million   with Saudi Hollandi Bank. The credit line has an interest rate equal to the Saudi Arabia Interbank Offered Rate plus a fixed rate of   0.85%   and is subject to annual renewal. Borrowings under this credit line were primarily used to fund capital expenditures related to the manufacturing facility in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of   September 30, 2016  , letters of credit under the credit line were   $0.2 million   and borrowings were   $12.6 million   with an interest rate of   2.67%  .  
  The estimated fair value of PolyOne s debt instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $  1,279.9 million   and $  1,136.2 million  , respectively, compared to carrying values of $  1,259.5 million   and   $1,146.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of PolyOne s debt instruments was estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities and represent Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  Note 11   SEGMENT INFORMATION    
  Operating income is the primary measure that is reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. Operating income at the segment level does not include: corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to segments; intersegment sales and profit eliminations; charges related to specific strategic initiatives such as the consolidation of operations; restructuring activities, including employee separation costs resulting from personnel reduction programs, plant realignment costs; executive separation agreements; share-based compensation costs; asset impairments; environmental remediation costs and other liabilities for facilities no longer owned or closed in prior years; gains and losses on the divestiture of joint ventures and equity investments; actuarial gains and losses associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans; and certain other items that are not included in the measure of segment profit or loss that is reported to and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. These costs are included in   Corporate and eliminations  . 
  PolyOne has   five   reportable segments: (1) Color, Additives and Inks; (2) Specialty Engineered Materials; (3) Designed Structures and Solutions; (4) Performance Products and Solutions; and (5) PolyOne Distribution.  
  Segment information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:

Note 12   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Environmental     We have been notified by federal and state environmental agencies and by private parties that we may be a potentially responsible party (PRP) in connection with the environmental investigation and remediation of certain sites. While government agencies frequently assert that PRPs are jointly and severally liable at these sites, in our experience, the interim and final allocations of liability costs are generally made based on the relative contribution of waste. We may also initiate corrective and preventive environmental projects of our own to ensure safe and lawful activities at our operations. We believe that compliance with current governmental regulations at all levels will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  In September 2007, we were informed of rulings by the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky on several pending motions in the case of Westlake Vinyls, Inc. v. Goodrich Corporation, et al., which had been pending since 2003. The Court held that PolyOne must pay the remediation costs at the former Goodrich Corporation Calvert City facility (now largely owned and operated by Westlake Vinyls), together with certain defense costs of Goodrich Corporation. The rulings also provided that PolyOne can seek indemnification for contamination attributable to Westlake Vinyls.  
  The environmental obligation at the site arose as a result of an agreement between The B.F.Goodrich Company (n/k/a Goodrich Corporation) and our predecessor, The Geon Company, at the time of the initial public offering in 1993, by which The Geon Company became a public company, to indemnify Goodrich Corporation for environmental costs at the site. At the time, neither PolyOne nor The Geon Company ever owned or operated the facility. Following the Court rulings, the parties to the litigation entered into settlement negotiations and agreed to settle all claims regarding past environmental costs incurred at the site. The settlement agreement provides a mechanism to pursue allocation of future remediation costs at the Calvert City site to Westlake Vinyls. While we do not currently assume any allocation of costs in our current accrual, we will adjust our accrual, in the future, consistent with any such future allocation of costs.  
  A remedial investigation and feasibility study (RIFS) is underway at Calvert City. During the third quarter of 2013, we submitted a remedial investigation report to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The USEPA required certain changes to the remedial investigation report and provided a final report in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, the USEPA assumed responsibility for the completion of the feasibility study. We continue to pursue available insurance coverage related to this matter and recognize gains as we receive reimbursement. No receivable has been recognized for future recoveries.

On March 13, 2013, PolyOne acquired Spartech. One of Spartech's subsidiaries, Franklin-Burlington Plastics, Inc. (Franklin-Burlington), operated a plastic resin compounding facility in Kearny, New Jersey, located adjacent to the Passaic River. The USEPA has requested that companies located in the area of the lower Passaic River, including Franklin-Burlington, cooperate in an investigation of contamination of approximately   17   miles of the lower Passaic River (the lower Passaic River Study Area). In response, Franklin-Burlington and approximately   70   other companies (collectively, the Cooperating Parties) agreed, pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the USEPA, to assume responsibility for development of a RIFS of the lower Passaic River Study Area. The RIFS costs are exclusive of any costs that may ultimately be required to remediate the lower Passaic River Study Area or costs associated with natural resource damages that may be assessed. By agreeing to bear a portion of the cost of the RIFS, Franklin-Burlington did not admit to any liability or agree to bear any such remediation or natural resource damage costs. 
  In February 2015, the Cooperating Parties submitted to the USEPA a remedial investigation report for the lower Passaic River Study Area. In March 2015, Franklin-Burlington, along with   nine   other PRPs, submitted a de minimis settlement petition to the USEPA, asserting the   ten   entities contributed little or no impact to the lower Passaic River and seeking a meeting to commence settlement discussions. In April 2015, the Cooperating Parties submitted a feasibility study to the USEPA. The feasibility study does not contemplate who is responsible for remediation nor does it determine how such costs will be allocated to PRPs. The Cooperating Parties are currently revising their RIFS, which has not yet been approved by the USEPA, as part of continuing technical discussions with the USEPA. 
  On March 4, 2016, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision selecting a remedy for an   eight  -mile portion of the lower Passaic River Study Area at an estimated and discounted cost of   $1.4 billion  . On March 31, 2016, the USEPA sent a Notice of Potential Liability (the Notice) to over   100   companies, including Franklin-Burlington, and several municipalities for this   eight  -mile portion, in which the USEPA stated it intended to negotiate an AOC for Remedial Design with Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) and, upon signature, planned to negotiate a consent decree with other major PRPs to perform remedial actions. The Notice did not identify the  other major PRPs.  Further, the Notice communicated that the USEPA will provide to certain parties separate notice of the opportunity to discuss a cash-out settlement at a later date. On September 30, 2016, the USEPA reached an agreement with OCC, which orders OCC to perform the remedial design for the lower   eight   mile portion of the Passaic River. 
  Based on the currently available information, we have found no evidence that Franklin-Burlington contributed any of the primary contaminants of concern to the lower Passaic River. Any allocation to Franklin-Burlington, including a final resolution of our de minimis petition or other opportunity for cash-out settlement, or further appropriate legal actions has not been determined. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to estimate a liability, if any, related to this matter. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not accrued for costs of remediation related to the lower Passaic River.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , PolyOne recognized   $6.1 million   and   $7.8 million  , respectively, of expense related to environmental remediation activities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received   $5.3 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, of insurance recoveries related to previously incurred environmental costs. These expenses and gains associated with these reimbursements are included within   Cost of sales   within our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income  . 
  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals totaling   $118.2 million   and   $119.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and     December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on our estimates of probable future environmental expenditures relating to previously contaminated sites. These undiscounted amounts are included in   Accrued expenses and other liabilities   and   Other non-current liabilities   on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accruals represent our best estimate of probable future costs that we can reasonably estimate, based upon currently available information and technology and our view of the most likely remedy. Depending upon the results of future testing, completion and results of remedial investigation and feasibility studies, the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken, changes in regulations, technology development, new information, newly discovered conditions and other factors, it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued at   September 30, 2016  . However, such additional costs, if any, cannot be currently estimated. Further, we have not recorded receivables for future available insurance recoveries associated with these costs. 
  Guarantee     On February 28, 2011, we sold our   50%   equity interest in SunBelt Chlor Alkali Partnership (SunBelt) to Olin Corporation (Olin). As a result of the sale, Olin assumed our obligations under our guarantee of senior secured notes issued by SunBelt, which are   $12.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Unless the guarantee is formally assigned to Olin, we remain obligated under the guarantee, although Olin has agreed to indemnify us for amounts that we may be obligated to pay under the guarantee. The senior secured notes mature in December 2017.

  Highlights and Executive Summary 
  A summary of PolyOne s sales, operating income, net income and net income attributable to PolyOne common shareholders follows: 

Recent Developments 
  On   July 26, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings, Inc. (Gordon Holdings) doing business as Gordon Composites, Inc. (Gordon Composites) and Polystrand, Inc. (Polystrand). Gordon Composites develops high strength profiles and laminates for use in vertical and crossbow archery, sports and recreation equipment, prosthetics and office furniture systems. Polystrand operates on the leading edge of continuous reinforced thermoplastic composite technology, a next generation material science that delivers the high strength and lightweight characteristics of composites, further enhanced with the design flexibility to form more complex shapes. The purchase price was   $85.5 million   and the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the period subsequent to the date of the acquisition and are reported in the Specialty Engineered Materials segment.

Results of Operations       The   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  : 

Sales 
  Sales increased   $2.0 million  , or   0.2%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This was primarily driven by underlying sales growth of 4.5% and the acquisition of Gordon Composites, Polystrand, Magenta Master Fibers (Magenta) and certain thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) assets purchased from Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc. (Kraton), which increased sales by 2.4%. Partially offsetting this increase was declining hydrocarbon based raw material costs that led to reduced overall average selling prices, particularly for the Performance Products and Solutions, PolyOne Distribution and Designed Structures and Solutions (DSS) segments, which impacted sales by 2.6%. The remaining decrease is primarily due to volume declines largely associated with legacy Spartech Corporation (Spartech) business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.7%. 
  Sales decreased   $49.7 million  , or   1.9%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This was primarily driven by underlying sales growth of 3.8% and the acquisition of Gordon Composites, Polystrand, Magenta and certain TPE assets purchased from Kraton, which increased sales by 1.8%. This increase was offset by declining hydrocarbon based raw material costs that led to reduced overall average selling prices, particularly for the Performance Products and Solutions, PolyOne Distribution and DSS segments, which impacted sales by 3.7%. The remaining decrease is primarily due to volume declines largely associated with legacy Spartech business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.7%. 
  Cost of sales 
  As a percent of sales, cost of sales decreased from 79.9% in the   third   quarter of   2015   to 79.5% in the   third   quarter of   2016   and from 79.8% in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to 78.4% in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of lower overall input cost. 
  
   17 

Selling and administrative expense 
  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $2.0 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This was driven primarily by an increase in our investment in commercial resources of $2.6 million, selling and administrative expenses associated with acquired businesses of $2.2 million and a $1.4 million increase in restructuring charges primarily from the 2015 actions related to the closure of the two manufacturing facilities within DSS. Partially offsetting the increased costs was a decrease in other employee costs, including incentives, of $3.7 million. 
  The increase in selling and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $21.9 million   was driven primarily by an $8.5 million increase in employee costs, including incentives, selling and administrative expenses associated with acquired businesses of $4.0 million and our investment in commercial resources. In addition, 2016 was impacted by increased restructuring charges of $3.8 million and 2015 included a $3.6 million reversal of certain non-income tax reserves due to the expiration of statute of limitations. 
  Interest expense, net 
  Interest expense, net decreased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was driven by the repayments of higher interest-bearing debt during 2015 and a decrease in borrowings on our revolving credit facility during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Income taxes 
  The income tax provision includes U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, the Company s effective tax rate was   24.3%   and   26.9%  , respectively, compared to   13.4%   and   15.7%  , respectively, for the comparable periods of 2015. 
  A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate is as follows: 

The effective tax rates for all periods differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the significant items described below. 
  2016 Significant items 
  The   3.3%   and   0.9%   benefits for uncertain tax positions for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily relate to the reversal of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a   1.7%   adjustment related to previously filed U.S. federal income tax returns and corresponding foreign tax credits resulted in the favorable impact to the effective tax rate. 
  2015 Significant items 
  The   14.6%   benefit for uncertain tax positions for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to the reversal of an uncertain tax position due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The   0.4%   expense for uncertain tax positions for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an unfavorable foreign court ruling during the first quarter of 2015, which settled an uncertain tax position taken in a prior year, more than offsetting the benefit recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the   1.9%   and   18.1%   of respective benefits were a result of amending U.S. federal income tax returns from 2004 through 2012 to use foreign tax credits.

Sales and Operating Income     The   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  :  

Color, Additives and Inks       
  Sales decreased   $4.0 million  , or   2.0%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Sales increases of 2.2% due to the Magenta acquisition were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts of 1.1%, and sales declines of 1.8% associated with the legacy Spartech business. The remaining decline is a result of lower demand in our European and North American regions within the packaging and oil and gas end markets. 
  Sales decreased   $12.8 million  , or   2.0%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Sales increases of 2.2% due to the Magenta acquisition were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts of 1.5% and sales declines of 1.8% associated with the legacy Spartech business. The remaining decline is a result of lower demand in our European and North American regions within the packaging and oil and gas end markets. 
  Operating income declined   $3.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to lower sales in the packaging and oil and gas end markets, as well as a weaker British pound. 
  Operating income decreased   $3.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This decline is due to lower sales in the packaging and oil and gas end markets, a weaker British pound and increased investment in commercial resources.  
  
   20 

Specialty Engineered Materials 
  Sales increased   $10.2 million  , or   7.5%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Sales growth from the acquisition of Gordon Composites, Polystrand and certain TPE assets purchased from Kraton, partially offset by volume declines in the personal care market, resulted in a total increase of 4.2%. Additionally, product mix increased sales by 4.3%. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of 1.0%. 
  Sales increased   $12.9 million  , or   3.1%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Sales growth from the acquisition of Gordon Composites, Polystrand and certain TPE assets purchased from Kraton resulted in a total increase of 2.0%. Additionally, product mix increased sales by 2.1%. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of 1.0%. 
  Operating income increased   $0.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily as a result of acquisitions and expanding gross margin driven by improved mix, partially offset by volume declines in the personal care market. 
  Operating income increased   $2.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to the increase in operating income of $3.2 million related to acquisitions, which was partially offset by $0.7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact and volume declines in the personal care market. 
  Designed Structures and Solutions 
  Sales decreased   $15.4 million  , or   13.7%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   and   $34.3 million  , or   10.0%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to decreased average selling prices from lower hydrocarbon based raw material costs and lower volumes. 
  Operating income decreased   $4.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   and decreased   $11.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of decreased sales. 
  Performance Products and Solutions 
  Sales declined   $3.9 million  , or   2.2%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   reflecting organic volume growth of 1.3%. This increase was more than offset by reduced overall average selling prices, largely due to lower hydrocarbon based raw material costs.  
  Sales declined   $31.1 million  , or   5.7%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as volume gains were more than offset by a 6.1% decline related to reduced overall average selling prices, largely due to lower hydrocarbon based raw material costs. 
  Operating income increased   $1.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily as a result of organic volume growth and improved mix. 
  Operating income increased   $15.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of expanding gross margin driven by improved mix and organic volume growth. 
  PolyOne Distribution 
  In total, sales increased   $15.3 million  , or   5.9%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   and   $24.2 million  , or   3.1%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Volume growth of 13.9% and 11.8% for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, were partially offset by lower overall average selling prices due to declining hydrocarbon based resin costs. 
  Operating income increased   $0.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   as a result of increased sales, partially offset by increased selling and administrative costs resulting from our investment in commercial resources and margin compression from lower overall average selling prices due to declining hydrocarbon based resin costs. 
  
   21 

Operating income increased   $1.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of increased sales, partially offset by increased selling and administrative costs resulting from our investment in commercial resources and margin compression from lower overall average selling prices due to declining hydrocarbon based resin costs. 
  Corporate and Eliminations 
  Corporate and eliminations decreased   $6.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This improvement was primarily a result of lower restructuring costs of $9.1 million in 2016, which was partially offset by lower insurance reimbursements of previously incurred environmental costs of $2.1 million as compared to 2015.  
  Corporate and eliminations decreased   $0.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to lower restructuring charges of $15.3 million. Largely offsetting this decrease were increased acquisition costs of $5.6 million, primarily associated with inventory step up purchase accounting adjustments, employee costs and incentives of $5.1 million and the absence of a $3.6 million reversal of certain tax reserves due to the expiration of statute of limitations that was recognized in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of debt and equity. By laddering the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt maturities, reducing liquidity risk. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt with cash and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We may also seek to repurchase our outstanding common shares. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved have been and may continue to be material.   
  The following table summarizes our liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately 92% of the Company s cash and cash equivalents resided outside the United States. Repatriation of these funds could result in potential foreign and domestic taxes. To the extent foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested were to be repatriated, the potential U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. However, based on the Company s policy of permanent reinvestment, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability, if any. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities and related foreign withholding taxes is not practicable due to the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation and the Company s permanent reinvestment policy.  
  Cash Flows 
  The following describes the material components of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Operating Activities     In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $126.8 million   as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $  128.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of   $1.8 million   is driven by lower earnings, offset by lower interest paid of $7.6 million and increased insurance proceeds of $2.7 million. 
  Working capital as a percentage of sales, which we define as the average accounts receivable, plus average inventory, less average accounts payable, divided by sales, for the third quarter of 2016 increased to 10.7% compared to 9.6% for the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the recent acquisitions. 
  Investing Activities     Net cash used by investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of $  206.5 million   reflects the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings for $85.5 million, the acquisition of certain TPE assets purchased from Kraton for $72.8 million as well as $58.0 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by the sale of and proceeds from other assets of $9.8 million. 
  
   22 

Net cash used by investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of $59.7 million reflects $61.6 million of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sale of other assets of $1.9 million.   
  Financing Activities     Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $13.4 million   reflects the increase of   $100.0 million   to the senior secured term loan due 2022 for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings, offset primarily by   $50.7 million   of repurchases of our outstanding common shares,   $30.1 million   of dividends paid and   $4.4 million   repayment of long-term debt. 
  Net cash used by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $64.3 million   reflects $117.8 million of repurchases of our outstanding common shares and $26.8 million of dividends paid. These cash outflows were partially offset by net borrowings of $76.0 million under our revolving credit facility and a $4.3 million benefit related to the exercise of employee equity awards. 
  Debt 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount of debt totaled   $1,275.8 million  . Aggregate maturities of the principal amount of debt for the current year, next five years and thereafter, are as follows: 

On November 12, 2015, PolyOne entered into a senior secured term loan having an aggregate principal amount of   $550.0 million  .   One   percent of the principal amount is payable annually while the remaining balance matures on November 12, 2022. On June 15, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to its senior secured term loan. Under the terms of the amended senior secured term loan, the interest rate was reduced by 25 basis points to 275 basis points plus the greater of (i) the 1-, 2-, 3-, or 6-month LIBOR, at the Company's discretion, or (ii) 75 basis points. In connection with the amendment, the Company recognized   $0.4 million   of   Debt extinguishment costs   in our Consolidated Statements of Income. On August 3, 2016, the Company increased the senior secured term loan due 2022 by   $100.0 million   in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings. The weighted average annual interest rate for the senior secured term loan for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.50%   and   3.65%  , respectively. The total aggregate principal repayments as of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $4.4 million  . 
  PolyOne has outstanding   $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which mature on March 15, 2023. The senior notes bear an interest rate of   5.25%   per year, payable semi-annually, in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year.  
  The Company maintains a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 1, 2018, which provides a maximum borrowing facility size of   $400.0 million  , subject to a borrowing base with advances against certain U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable, inventory and other assets as specified in the agreement. We have the option to increase the availability under the facility to   $450.0 million  , subject to meeting certain requirements and obtaining commitments for such increase. The senior secured revolving credit facility has a U.S. and a Canadian line of credit. Currently there are   no   borrowings on the Canadian portion of the facility. Advances under the U.S. portion of our revolving credit facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at a Base Rate or a LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half percent, (ii) the prevailing LIBOR Rate plus one percent, and (iii) the prevailing Prime Rate. The applicable margins vary based on the Company s daily average excess availability during the previous quarter. The weighted average annual interest rate under this facility for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.00%   and   3.13%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding borrowings and had availability of   $381.7 million   under this facility.

The agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our secured term loan, and the indentures and credit agreements governing other debt, contain a number of customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: consummate asset sales, incur additional debt or liens, consolidate or merge with any entity or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries, make capital investments and alter the business we conduct. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants.  
  The Company also has a credit line of   $16.0 million   with Saudi Hollandi Bank. The credit line has an interest rate equal to the Saudi Arabia Interbank Offered Rate plus a fixed rate of   0.85%   and is subject to annual renewal. Borrowings under this credit line were primarily used to fund capital expenditures related to the manufacturing facility in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of   September 30, 2016  , letters of credit under the credit line were   $0.2 million   and borrowings were   $12.6 million   with an interest rate of   2.67%  . 
  Guarantee 
  On February 28, 2011, we sold our   50%   equity interest in SunBelt Chlor Alkali Partnership (SunBelt) to Olin Corporation (Olin). As a result of the sale, Olin assumed our obligations under our guarantee of senior secured notes issued by SunBelt, which are   $12.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Unless the guarantee is formally assigned to Olin, we remain obligated under the guarantee, although Olin has agreed to indemnify us for amounts that we may be obligated to pay under the guarantee. The senior secured notes mature in December 2017. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  We have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments, operating leases, pension and post-retirement benefit plans and purchase obligations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no     material changes to these obligations as reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, statements that are not reported financial results or other historical information are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. They are based on management s expectations that involve a number of business risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance and/or sales. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions; prospective changes in raw material costs, product pricing or product demand; future performance; estimated capital expenditures; results of current and anticipated market conditions and market strategies; sales efforts; expenses; the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and environmental liabilities; and financial results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

effects on foreign operations due to currency fluctuations, tariffs and other political, economic and regulatory risks; 
                
    changes in polymer consumption growth rates and laws and regulations regarding the disposal of plastic materials where we conduct business; 
                
    changes in global industry capacity or in the rate at which anticipated changes in industry capacity come online in the industries in which we participate; 
                
    fluctuations in raw material prices, quality and supply, and in energy prices and supply; 
                
    production outages or material costs associated with scheduled or unscheduled maintenance programs; 
                
    unanticipated developments that could occur with respect to contingencies such as litigation and environmental matters, including any developments that would require any increase in our costs and/or reserves for such contingencies; 
                
    an inability to achieve or delays in achieving or achievement of less than the anticipated financial benefit from initiatives related to working capital reductions, cost reductions and employee productivity goals; 
                
    an inability to raise or sustain prices for products or services;  
                
    an inability to maintain appropriate relations with unions and employees; 
                
    the strength and timing of economic recoveries; 
                
    the financial condition of our customers, including the ability of customers (especially those that may be highly leveraged and those with inadequate liquidity) to maintain their credit availability; 
                
    disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets that may limit our access to capital; 
                
    other factors affecting our business beyond our control, including, without limitation, changes in the general economy, changes in interest rates and changes in the rate of inflation; 
                
    the amount and timing of repurchases, if any, of PolyOne common shares; 
                
    our ability to pay regular quarterly cash dividends and the amounts and timing of any future dividends; 
                
    our ability to realize anticipated savings and operational benefits from the realignment of assets, including the closure of manufacturing facilities; the timing of closings and shifts of production to new facilities related to asset realignments and any unforeseen loss of customers and/or disruptions of service or quality caused by such closings and/or production shifts; separation and severance amounts that differ from original estimates, amounts for non-cash charges related to asset write-offs and accelerated depreciation realignments of property, plant and equipment, that differ from original estimates; 
                
    our ability to identify and evaluate acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions; 
                
    the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations, including whether such businesses will be accretive to our earnings, retain the management teams of acquired businesses, and retain relationships with customers of acquired businesses, including, without limitation, substantially all of the assets of Gordon Holdings, certain TPE assets from Kraton, Magenta and Spartech; 
     
   25 

information systems failures and cyberattacks; and 
                
    other factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   under Item 1A,  Risk Factors.  
     We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports on Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K filed with the SEC. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. 
   
  ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  There have been no material changes to exposures to market risk as reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .
