  United States, represented by Samir Patel, Vice President   Treasurer

of the fourth part. 
  
   0015274-0000214 BK:37209258.7        1 

WHEREAS: 
           (1) 
    The Borrowers have stated that they are undertaking, through their direct and/or indirect subsidiaries, a project of research, development and innovation ("  RDI  ") in the field of sustainable water and wastewater solutions over the period 2017-2019 at RDI units in Sweden, Germany, Italy, UK, Hungary and Austria, as more particularly described in the technical description (the "  Technical Description  ") set out in Schedule A (the "  Project  "). 
              (2) 
    The total cost of the Project, as estimated by the Bank, is EUR 214,600,000 (two hundred and fourteen million, six hundred thousand euros) and the Borrowers have stated that they intend to finance the Project as follows: 

(3) 
    In order to fulfil the financing plan set out in Recital (2), the Borrowers have requested from the Bank a credit equivalent to EUR 105,000,000 (one hundred and five million euros) in aggregate. 
              (4) 
    The Bank, considering that the financing of the Project falls within the scope of its functions, and having regard to the statements and facts cited in these Recitals, has decided to give effect to the Borrowers  request providing to them a credit in an amount equivalent to EUR 105,000,000 (one hundred and five million euros) in aggregate under this Finance Contract (the "  Contract  "); provided that the amount of the Bank loan shall not, in any case, exceed 50% (fifty per cent) of the total cost of the Project set out in Recital (2). 
              (5) 
    The board of managers of each of the Borrowers has authorised the borrowing of the sum of EUR 105,000,000 (one hundred and five million euros) in aggregate represented by this credit on the terms and conditions set out in this Contract and in Annex I.  
              (6) 
    The financial obligations of the Borrowers under this Contract are to be guaranteed by the Guarantor under a guarantee and indemnity (the "  Guarantee  ") by execution of a guarantee and indemnity agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank (the "  Guarantee Agreement  "). 
              (7) 
    The Statute of the Bank provides that the Bank shall ensure that its funds are used as rationally as possible in the interests of the European Union; and, accordingly, the terms and conditions of the Bank's loan operations must be consistent with relevant policies of the European Union. 
              (8) 
    The Credit falls under a joint initiative between the Bank and the European Commission, which is intended as a new Bank financing instrument, to finance, inter alia, research projects and research infrastructure under the Horizon 2020 framework programme of the European Union for Research and Technological Development (2014-2020) ("  Horizon 2020  "). 
              (9) 
    The Bank considers that access to information plays an essential role in the reduction of environmental and social risks, including human rights violations, linked to the projects it finances. The Bank has therefore established its transparency policy, the purpose of which is to enhance the accountability of the Bank's group companies towards its stakeholders and the citizens of the European Union in general, by giving access to the information that will enable them to understand its governance, strategy, policies, activities and practices.  

0015274-0000214 BK:37209258.7        2 

(10) 
    The processing of personal data shall be carried out by the Bank in accordance with applicable European Union legislation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the EC institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data.

   0015274-0000214 BK:37209258.7        21 

(b) 
    on the Final Availability Date; or, if the Credit is cancelled in full under Article 1.06 prior to the Final Availability Date, on the date of cancellation. 
     If the date on which the non-utilisation fee is due to be paid is not a Relevant Business Day, payment shall be made on the next day, if any, of that calendar month that is a Relevant Business Day or, failing that, the nearest preceding day that is a Relevant Business Day, in all cases with a corresponding adjustment to the amount of non-utilisation fee due. 
   Sums due under Articles 1.05 and 1.06 shall be payable in the currency of the Tranche concerned. They shall be payable within 15 (fifteen) days of the relevant Borrower's receipt of the Bank's demand or within any longer period specified in the Bank's demand.

0015274-0000214 BK:37209258.7        22 

The relevant Borrower shall pay interest on the outstanding balance of each Fixed Rate Tranche at the Fixed Rate quarterly, semi-annually or annually in arrear on the relevant Payment Dates as specified in the Disbursement Offer, commencing on the first Payment Date following the date on which the disbursement of the Tranche was made. If the period from the date on which disbursement was made to the first Payment Date is 15 (fifteen) days or less then the payment of interest accrued during such period shall be postponed to the following Payment Date. 
  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of Article 5.01(a) at an annual rate that is the Fixed Rate.

  Interest shall be calculated in respect of each Floating Rate Reference Period on the basis of Article 5.01(b). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Floating Rate for any Floating Rate Reference Period is below zero, it will be set at zero. 
           3.01D 
    Revision or Conversion of Tranches 
     Where the relevant Borrower exercises an option to revise or convert the interest rate basis of a Tranche, it shall, from the effective Interest Revision/Conversion Date (in accordance with the procedure set out in Schedule D) pay interest at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule D. 
   Without prejudice to Article 10 and by way of exception to Article 3.01, if the Borrower fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Contract on its due date, interest shall accrue on any overdue amount payable under the terms of this Contract from the due date to the date of actual payment at an annual rate equal to: 
           (a)

  If the overdue sum is in a currency other than the currency of the Loan, the following rate per annum shall apply, namely the relevant interbank rate that is generally retained by the Bank for transactions in that currency plus 2% (200 basis points), calculated in accordance with the market practice for such rate. 
   In relation to a specific Accepted Tranche, if at any time between the date of receipt by the Bank of a Disbursement Acceptance in respect of such Tranche, and the date falling either thirty (30) calendar days for Tranches to be disbursed in EUR, GBD or USD, or, in the case of Tranches to be disbursed in any other currency, two Business Days prior to the Scheduled Disbursement Date, a Market Disruption Event occurs, the Bank may notify to the relevant Borrower that this clause has come into effect.

              - 
    the Margin; and 
              - 
    the rate (expressed as a percentage rate per annum) which is determined by the Bank to be the all-inclusive cost to the Bank for the funding of the relevant Tranche based upon the then applicable internally generated Bank reference rate or an alternative rate determination method reasonably determined by the Bank. The relevant Borrower shall have the right to refuse in writing such disbursement within the deadline specified in the notification and shall bear charges incurred as a result, if any, in which case the Bank shall not effect the disbursement and the corresponding Credit shall remain available for disbursement under Article 1.02B. If the relevant Borrower does not refuse the disbursement in time, the parties agree that the disbursement and the conditions thereof shall be fully binding for both parties. 
              (b) 
    in the case of an Accepted Tranche to be disbursed in a currency other than EUR, USD or GBP, the Bank shall notify to the relevant Borrower the EUR equivalent to be disbursed on the Scheduled Disbursement Date and the relevant percentage rate as described above under (a) applicable to the Tranche until the Maturity Date or the Interest Revision/Conversion Date if any.

             (a) 
    The relevant Borrower shall repay each Tranche by instalments on the Payment Dates specified in the relevant Disbursement Offer in accordance with the terms of the amortisation table delivered pursuant to Article 2.03. 
              (b) 
    Each amortisation table shall be drawn up on the basis that: 
              (i) 
    in the case of a Fixed Rate Tranche without an Interest Revision/Conversion Date, repayment shall be made annually, semi-annually or quarterly by equal instalments of principal or constant instalments consisting of principal and interest; 
              (ii) 
    in the case of a Fixed Rate Tranche with an Interest Revision/Conversion Date or a Floating Rate Tranche, repayment shall be made by equal annual, semi-annual or quarterly instalments of principal;  
              (iii) 
    the first repayment date of each Tranche shall be a Payment Date falling not earlier than 60 days from the Scheduled Disbursement Date and not later than the first Payment Date immediately following the third anniversary of the Scheduled Disbursement Date of the Tranche; and

0015274-0000214 BK:37209258.7        25 

Subject to Article 4.02B(3) below, if the relevant Borrower prepays a Fixed Rate Tranche, relevant Borrower shall pay to the Bank on the Prepayment Date the Prepayment Indemnity. 
   Subject to Article 4.02B(3) below, the relevant Borrower may prepay a Floating Rate Tranche without indemnity on any relevant Payment Date.  
   Unless a Borrower has accepted in writing a Fixed Rate in respect of an Interest Revision/Conversion Proposal pursuant to Schedule D, prepayment of a Tranche on its Interest Revision/Conversion Date as accepted under Article 1.02C, or in accordance with Schedule C.1 or D, as the case may be, is effected without indemnity. 
   The Bank shall notify the relevant Borrower not later than 15 (fifteen) days prior to the Prepayment Date, of the Prepayment Amount, of the accrued interest due thereon of the indemnity payable under Article 4.02B or, as the case may be, that no indemnity is due, of the method of application of the Prepayment Amount and the Acceptance Deadline. 
  Not later than the Acceptance Deadline, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Bank either: 
           (a) 
    that it confirms the Prepayment Notice  on the terms specified by the Bank; or 
              (b) 
    that it withdraws the Prepayment Request. 
     If the relevant Borrower gives the confirmation under paragraph (a) above, it shall effect the prepayment. If the relevant Borrower withdraws the Prepayment Request or fails to confirm it in due time, it may not effect the prepayment. Save as aforesaid, the Prepayment Notice shall be binding and irrevocable. 
  The relevant Borrower shall accompany the prepayment by the payment of accrued interest and indemnity, if any, due on the Prepayment Amount. 
     If the total cost of the Project as notified by either of the, or both, Borrowers to the Bank is reduced from the figure stated in Recital (2) to a level at which the amount of the Credit exceeds 50% (fifty per cent) of such cost, the Bank may in proportion to the reduction forthwith, by notice to the Borrowers, cancel the undisbursed portion of the Credit and/or demand prepayment of the Loan. Each Borrower shall effect payment of the amount demanded of it on the date specified by the Bank, such date being a date falling not less than 30 (thirty) days from the date of the demand. 

0015274-0000214 BK:37209258.7        26 

If a Borrower (or any other member of the Group) voluntarily prepays (for the avoidance of doubt, prepayment shall include repurchase or cancellation where applicable) a part or the whole of any other Non-EIB Financing and:  
           - 
    such prepayment is not made within a revolving credit facility (save for cancellation of the revolving credit facility); or 
              - 
    such prepayment is not made out of the proceeds of a loan having a term at least equal to the unexpired term of the Non-EIB Financing prepaid; or 
              - 
    following such prepayment the aggregate of the outstanding Loan and any other direct loans from the Bank constitutes more than 50% (fifty per cent.) of the aggregate outstanding Non-EIB Financing to the Group, 
     the Bank may, by notice to the Borrowers, cancel the undisbursed portion of the Credit and demand prepayment of the Loan. The proportion of the Loan that the Bank may require to be prepaid shall be the same as the proportion that the prepaid amount of the Non-EIB Financing bears to the aggregate outstanding amount of all Non-EIB Financing. 
  Each Borrower shall effect payment of the amount demanded from it on the date specified by the Bank, such date being a date falling not less than 30 (thirty) days from the date of the demand. 
  For the purposes of this Article, "  Non-EIB Financing  " includes any loan, (save for the Loan and any other direct loans from the Bank), credit bond or other form of financial indebtedness or any obligation for the payment or repayment of money originally granted to a Borrower or the Guarantor or the Group for a term of more than 3 (three) years. 
   A Borrower shall promptly inform the Bank if a Change-of-Control Event has occurred.  
  At any time after the occurrence of a Change-of-Control Event, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower cancel the undisbursed portion of the Credit and demand prepayment of the Loan, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding under this Contract.  
  Each Borrower shall effect payment of the amount demanded of it on the date specified by the Bank, such date being a date falling not less than 30 (thirty) days from the date of the demand. 
  For the purposes of this Article: 
           (a) 
    a "  Change-of-Control Event  " occurs if: 
              (i)

Such consultation shall take place within 30 (thirty) days from the date of the Bank's request. If, after the lapse of 30 (thirty) days from the date of such request for consultation the Bank is of the reasonable opinion that the effects of the Change-of-Law Event cannot be mitigated to its satisfaction, the Bank may by notice to the Borrowers, cancel the undisbursed portion of the Credit and/or demand prepayment of the Loan, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding under this Contract.
