INDEPENDENCE TAX CREDIT PLUS L.P. IV  AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

September 30, 2016 

(Unaudited) 

NOTE 1   General   

The condensed consolidated financial statements, as of September 30,  2016, include the accounts of Independence Tax Credit Plus L.P. IV (the  Partnership ) and two other limited partnerships ( subsidiary partnerships ,  subsidiaries  or  Local Partnerships ) owning affordable apartment complexes ( Properties ) that are eligible for the low-income housing tax credits.  As of September 30,  2016, the Partnership has an ownership interest in only one remaining investment.  The general partner of the Partnership is Related Independence L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the  General Partner ). Centerline Holding Company ( Centerline ) was the ultimate parent of Centerline Affordable Housing Advisors LLC ( CAHA ), the sole member of the Manager of the General Partner. On April 15, 2015, Alden Torch Financial LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited company ( ATF ), became the indirect owner of 100% of the equity interests in Centerline. Since April 15, 2015, ATF has been the ultimate parent and indirect owner of 100% of the equity interests in CAHA. Through the rights of the Partnership and/or an affiliate of the General Partner, which affiliate has a contractual obligation to act on behalf of the Partnership to remove the general partner of each of the subsidiary partnerships (each  Local General Partner ) and to approve certain major operating and financial decisions, the Partnership has a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary partnerships. 		 

For financial reporting purposes, the Partnership s fiscal quarter ends September 30  th  .     The remaining Local Partership s fiscal quarter ends June 30  th  .  Accounts of the remaining Local Partnership have been adjusted for intercompany transactions from July 1  st    through September 30  th  . The Partnership s fiscal quarter ends three months after the remaining Local Partnership in order to allow adequate time for the subsidiary s financial statements to be prepared and consolidated.  All  intercompany accounts and transactions with the remaining Local Partnership have been eliminated in consolidation. 		 

The net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests amounted to approximately $132,000 and $(3,165,000) and $132,000 and $(3,651,000) for the three and   six months ended September 30,   2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Partnership s investment in each subsidiary is equal to the respective subsidiary s partners  equity less noncontrolling interest capital, if any. 

Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted or condensed. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 

The books and records of the Partnership are maintained on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In the opinion of the General Partner of the Partnership, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Partnership as of September 30,  2016 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  .  However, the operating results and cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of the results for the entire year. 		 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In March of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Shared Based Payment Accounting: Topic 718  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of how companies account for share-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is affective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early

adoption is permitted. The new guidance will not have an impact on the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases   Topic 842  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all leases greather than one year in duration and classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016.02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within that fiscal year. The new guidance will not have an impact on the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The ASU modifies existing consolidation guidance  related to (i) limited partnerships and similar legal entities, (ii) the evaluation of variable interests for fees paid to decision makers or service providers, (iii) the effect of fee arrangements and related parties on the primary beneficiary determination, and (iv) certain investment funds. These changes are expected to limit the number of consolidation models and place more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will not have an impact on the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements. 		 

In May 14, 2014, FASB and IASB issued a new joint revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all US GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The core principal of the standard is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new standard is effective for the Partnership for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2018 and the effects of the standard on the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements are not known at this time. 

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard update provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. The new guidance is effective for all annual and interim periods ending after December 16, 2016. The new guidance will not have an impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The costs incurred to related parties from operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

*  Reclassified for comparative purposes. 

The costs incurred to related parties from discontinued operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

*  Reclassified for comparative purposes. 

(a) 

The General Partner is entitled to receive a partnership management fee, after payment of all Partnership expenses, which together with the annual local administrative fees will not exceed a maximum of 0.5% per annum of invested assets (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), for administering the affairs of the Partnership. Subject to the foregoing limitation, the partnership management fee will be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion based upon its review of the Partnership s investments.  Unpaid partnership management fees for any year are deferred without interest and will be payable out of sales or refinancing proceeds only to the extent of available funds after payments on all Partnership liabilities have been made other than those owed to the General Partner and its affiliates.  Partnership management fees owed to the General Partner amounting to approximately $60,000 and $12,000 were accrued and unpaid as of September 30,  2016 and March 31,  2016, respectively.  Current year partnership management fees may be paid out of operating reserves or refinancing and sales proceeds.  However, the General Partner cannot demand payment of the deferred fees beyond the Partnership s ability to pay them.     

(b) 

The Partnership reimburses the General Partner and its affiliates for actual Partnership operating expenses incurred by the General Partner and its affiliates on the Partnership s behalf. The amount of reimbursement from the Partnership is limited by the provisions of the Partnership Agreement. Another affiliate of the General Partner performs asset

monitoring for the Partnership. These services include site visits and evaluations of the subsidiary partnerships  performance.  Expense reimbursements and asset monitoring fees owed to the General Partner and its affiliates amounting to approximately $78,000 and $0 were accrued and unpaid as of September 30,  2016 and March 31,  2016, respectively. The General Partner does not intend to demand payment of the deferred payables beyond the Partnership s ability to pay them.  The Partnership anticipates that these will be paid, if at all, from working capital reserves or future sales proceeds.     

(c) 

Independence SLP IV L.P., a special limited partner of the subsidiary partnerships, is entitled to receive a local administrative fee of up to $5,000 per year from each subsidiary partnership.  Local administrative fees owed to Independence SLP IV L.P. amounting to $0 and $73,000 were accrued and unpaid as of September 30,  2016 and March 31,  2016, respectively. These fees have been deferred in certain cases and the Partnership anticipates that they will be paid, if at all, from working capital reserves or future sales proceeds.     

As of September 30,  2016 and March 31,  2016, the Partnership owed approximately $4,000 and $1,000, respectively, to the General Partner for expenses it paid on its behalf. 

B)  Due to/from Local General Partners and Affiliates 

The amounts due to Local General Partners and affiliates from operating liabilities consist of the following: 

NOTE 3  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments (all of which are held for nontrading purposes) for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Cash Held in Escrow 

The carrying amount approximates fair value. 

Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities 

The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 

Mortgage Notes Payable 

The Partnership has categorized the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based upon the fair value hierarchy specified by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820 ). This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures.  This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present   

10 

Table of Contents  

INDEPENDENCE TAX CREDIT PLUS L.P. IV  AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

September 30, 2016 

(Unaudited) 

value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).  This standard provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.  The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1:  

Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2:  

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  

Level 3:  

Unobservable inputs that reflect the Partnership s own assumptions.  

The estimated fair value of mortgage notes payable has been determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.  However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value.  Consequently, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange. The following are financial instruments for which the Partnership s estimate of fair value differs from the carrying amounts: 

For the mortgage notes, fair value is estimated using Level 3 inputs and calculated using present value cash flow models based on a discount rate.  The Partnership has not been active in the tender option bond market, through which these bonds have been securitized in the past. To assist in valuing these notes, the Partnership held separate discussions with various third party investment banks who are leaders in the municipal bond business.  The discussions produced assumptions that were based on market conditions as well as the credit quality of the underlying property partnerships, which held the mortgage notes, to determine what discount rates to utilize. 

Due to General Partner and Affiliates and Due to/from Local General Partners and Affiliates 

Management believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of due to General Partner and affiliates and due to/from Local General Partners and affiliates because market information on such obligations is not currently available. 

NOTE 4   Sale of Properties 

The Partnership has developed a plan to dispose of its last remaining investment.  It is anticipated that this process will take from 12 to 24 months. Through September 30, 2016, the Partnership has sold its limited partnership interest in  nine Local Partnerships and the property and the related assets and liabilities of four Local Partnerships have been sold. There can be no assurance as to when the Partnership will dispose of its last remaining investment or the amount of proceeds which may be received.  However, based on the historical operating results of the Local Partnerships and the current economic conditions, the proceeds from such sales received by the Partnership will not be sufficient to return to the limited partners their original investments.  All gains and losses on sales are included in discontinued operations. 

On September 21, 2016, the Partnership sold its limited partnership interest in Bakery Village Urban Renewal Associates, L.P. ( Bakery Village ) to an affiliate of the Local General Partner for a sales price of approximately $2,200,000. The sale

resulted in a gain of approximately $5,247,000 resulting from the write-off of the deficit basis in the Local Partnership plus the cash recived by the Partnership, which was recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

On July 27, 2015, the Partnership sold its limited partnership interest in First African Kanisa Apartments ( First African ) to an affiliate of the Local General Partner for a sales price of $1. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $1,603,000 resulting from the write-off of the deficit basis in the Local Partnership of the same amount at the date of the sale, which was recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. An adjustment to the gain of approximately $88,000 was recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 resulting in an overall gain of $1,515,000. 

On June 1, 2015, the Partnership sold its limited partnership interest in KSD Village Apartments Phase II, Ltd. ( KSD Village ) to an unaffiliated third party purchaser for a sales price of $1. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $293,000 resulting from the write-off of the deficit basis in the Local Partnership of the same amount at the date of the sale, which was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. An adjustment to the gain of approximately $61,000 was recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 resulting in an overall gain of $232,000. 

On June 15, 2015, the property and the related assets and liabilities of Kaneohe Limited Partnership ( Kaneohe ) were sold to an unaffiliated third party purchaser for a sales price of $10,100,000. The Partnership received $2,893,000 as a distribution from this sale after the repayment of the mortgages, other liabilities and closing costs of approximately $7,207,000. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $4,587,000 which was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. An adjustment to the gain of approximately $4,073,000 was recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 due to a distribution from this sale in the form of a Security Agreement to the Local General Partner in the amount of $4,069,000. Additional adjustments to the gain of approximately $1,000 and $196,000 were recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively resulting in an overall gain of $8,857,000.

NOTE 5   Discontinued Operations 

The following table summarizes the results of operations of the Local Partnerships that are classified as discontinued operations.  For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, Bakery Village which was sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was classified as discontinued operations.

Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations: 

*      Reclassified for comparative purposes  . 

NOTE 6   Commitments and Contingencies 

a)     Uninsured Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Partnership maintains its cash and cash equivalents in various banks.  The accounts at each bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000 per entity per institution. At times, the balances exceed the FDIC insurance limit. 

b)     Cash Distributions 

Cash distributions from the Local Partnerships to the Partnership are restricted by the provisions of the respective agreements of limited partnership of the Local Partnerships. 

c)     Property Management Fees 

Property management fees incurred by the Local Partnerships amounted to approximately $22,000 and $109,000 and $45,000 and $143,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Of these fees, approximately $22,000 and $102,000 and $45,000 and $130,000 were incurred to the Local General Partners for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which include approximately $15,000 and $96,000 and $32,000 and $118,000 of fees relating to discontinued operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

d)     Other 

The Partnership is subject to risks incidental to potential losses arising from the management and ownership of real estate.  The Partnership can also be affected by poor economic conditions generally. There are also substantial risks associated with owning properties receiving government assistance, for example the possibility that Congress may not appropriate funds to enable the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) to make rental assistance payments. HUD also restricts annual cash distributions to partners based on operating results and a percentage of the owners  equity contribution.  The Partnership cannot sell or substantially liquidate its investment in its last remaining subsidiary partnership during the period that the subsidy agreement is in existence without HUD s approval.  Furthermore there may not be market demand for apartments at full market rents when the rental assistance contract expires.

The Partnership and BACs holders began to recognize Tax Credits with respect to a Property when the Credit Period for such Property commenced (generally ten years from the date of investment or, if later, the date the Property is leased to qualified tenants). Because of the time required for the acquisition, completion and rent-up of Properties, the amount of Tax Credits per BAC gradually increased over the first three years of the Partnership.  Tax Credits not recognized in the first three years were recognized in the 11th through 13th years.  As of December 31, 2012, all the Local Partnerships had completed their Credit Periods. However, each Local Partnership must continue to comply with the Tax Credit requirements until the end of the Compliance Period in order to avoid recapture of the Tax Credits.  The remaining Local Partnership has completed its Compliance Period.  

e)     Subsequent Events 

The Partnership evaluated all subsequent events from the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet through the issuance date of these financial statements and determined that there were no events or transactions occurring during the subsequent event reporting period which require recognition or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Partnership originally invested all of its net proceeds in fourteen Local Partnerships of which, approximately $82,000 remains to be paid to the last remaining Local Partnership (including approximately $82,000 being held in escrow). The Partnership has developed a plan to dispose of its last remaining investment. Through September 30, 2016, the Partnership has sold its limited partnership interests in nine Local Partnerships and the property and the related assets and liabilities of four Local Partnerships have been sold.  There can be no assurance as to when the Partnership will dispose of its last remaining investment or the amount of proceeds which may be received.  However, based on the historical operating results of the Local Partnerships and the current economic conditions, the proceeds from such sale received by the Partnership will not be sufficient to return to the limited partners their original investments.  All gains and losses on sales are included in discontinued operations.     		 

Short-Term 

The Partnership s primary sources of funds include:  (i) working capital reserves; (ii) interest earned on the working capital reserves; (iii) cash distributions from operations of the Local Partnerships; and (iv) sales and/or refinance proceeds and distributions.  Such funds, although minimal (other than possible sales and/or refinance proceeds and distributions), are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership.  During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,  there were no distributions from operations of the Local Partnerships. In addition, during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, distributions to the Partnership from sales proceeds amounted to approximately $2,121,000 and $2,825,000, respectively.      The Partnership does not anticipate providing cash distributions to BACs holders in circumstances other than refinancing or sales. 		 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership and its consolidated Local Partnership increased approximately $1,759,000.  This increase was due to proceeds from the sale of a property of $2,121,000, net repayments to local general partners and affiliates of approximately ($56,000),  and a decrease in cash held in escrow relating to investing activities of approximately ($4,000),  which exceeded cash used in operating activities of approximately ($298,000) and repayment of mortgage notes of approximately ($124,000).  Included in the adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash used in operating activities is depreciation and amortization in the amount of approximately ($4,600). 

Total expenses from operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, excluding depreciation and amortization, interest and general and administrative-related parties, totaled $189,202 and $142,743 and $343,019 and $305,359, respectively.   

Accounts payable from operations as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 were $46,728 and $124,790, respectively.  Accounts payable are short term liabilities which are expected to be paid from operating cash flows, working capital balances at the Local Partnership level, Local General Partner advances and in certain circumstances advances from the Partnership. Accrued interest payable from operations as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 was $59,018 and $63,220, respectively.  Such amount represents the accrued interest on all mortgage loans, which include primary and secondary loans.  Certain secondary loans have provisions such that interest is accrued but not payable until a future date.  In addition, the last remaining Local Partnership s mortgage note is collateralized by the land and buildings of the Local Partnership, and are without further recourse to the Partnership. The maximum loss the Partnership would incur is its net investment in the last remaining Local Partnership. 		 

The Partnership has unconsolidated cash reserves of approximately $2,395,000 at September 30, 2016. Such amount is considered sufficient to cover the Partnership s day to day operating expenses, excluding fees to the General Partner, for at least the next fiscal year.

Table of Contents  

At September 30, 2016, the Partnership s assets exceeded liabilities by $967,051 and for the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized net income of $5,020,696.  However, because 1) the provisions of the secondary loans defer the payment of accrued interest of the Local Partnership and will be made from future refinancing or sales proceeds of the Local Partnership, 2) the General Partner continues to defer (pending the Partnership s receipt of sales and refinancing proceeds) the payment of fees as discussed below and in Note 2 to the Financial Statements, and 3) the Partnership has sufficient unconsolidated working capital reserves to cover the Partnership s day to day operating expenses, the Partnership (and its last remaining Local Partnership) believes it has sufficient liquidity and ability to generate cash and to meet existing and known or reasonably likely future cash requirements over both the short and long term. 		 

Long-Term  

Partnership management fees owed to the General Partner amounting to approximately $60,000 and $12,000 were accrued and unpaid as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and are included in the line item Due to general partners and affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets.  Unpaid partnership management fees for any year are to be deferred without interest and will be payable out of sales or refinancing proceeds only to the extent of available funds after payments on all Partnership liabilities have been made other than to those owed to the General Partner and its affiliates. 

All other payables are expected to be paid, if at all, from working capital reserves.  See Note 2 in Item 1 for further discussion of amounts due to the General Partner and its affiliates.  The General Partner does not anticipate making any future advances of operating funds to the last remaining Local Partnership in which the Partnership has invested.  Even if a situation arose where the General Partner and its affiliates needed to but were not able to make operating advances in the future due to lack of funds, the only impact on the Partnership would be that it would lose its investment in its last remaining Local Partnership.  The Partnership s ability to continue its operations would not be affected. 

Since the maximum loss the Partnership would be liable for is its net investment in its last remaining subsidiary partnership, the resolution of any existing contingencies is not anticipated to impact future liquidity or the financial condition of the Partnership in a material way.  

Except as described above, management is not aware of any trends or events, commitments or uncertainties, which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way. Management believes the only impact would be from laws that have not yet been adopted. The Partnership had originally invested the proceeds of its Offering in 14 Local Partnerships, all of which had their Tax Credits fully in place during the Credit Periods.  As of December 31, 2012, all the Local Partnerships have completed their Credit Periods.  

Results of Operations 

The Partnership s results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consisted primarily of the results of the Partnership s investment in the last remaining Local Partnership.  The following discussion excludes the Partnership s results of its discontinued operations, which are not reflected below. 

Rental income increased approximately 3% for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a slight increase in occupancy at the remaining Local Partnership. 

Total expenses, excluding general and administrative-related parties expenses,  general and administrative for non-related parties expenses and repairs and maintenance expenses, remained fairly consistent with an increase of approximately 7% and 5% for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015. 

General and administrative-related parties  expenses decreased approximately $49,000 and $46,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods ended September 30, 2015,  primarily due to a decrease in overhead expense reimbursements and partnership management fees resulting from the sale of properties at the Partnership level.

Table of Contents  

General and administrative for non-related parties  expenses increased approximately $58,000 and $92,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods ended September 30, 2015,  primarily due to an increase in legal expenses at the Partnership level. 

Repairs and maintenance expense decreased approximately $17,000 and $60,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an decrease in major repairs expenses and turnover supplies expenses at the remaining Local Partnership. 

Depreciation and amortization remained fairly consistent with no change for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period ended September 30, 2015. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Partnership has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Fair Value Measurements 

See Note 3 in Item 1 for methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments (all of which are held for nontrading purposes) for which it is practicable to estimate that value. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the Partnership.  The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Partnership s accounting policies included in Item 8, Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment to be held and used are carried at cost which includes the purchase price, acquisition fees and expenses, construction period interest and any other costs incurred in acquiring the Properties.  The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over their estimated useful lives using accelerated and straight-line methods.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred; major renewals and betterments are capitalized.  At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the assets and accumulated depreciation accounts and the profit or loss on such disposition is reflected in earnings.  The Partnership complies with ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment  .  A loss on impairment of assets is recorded when management estimates amounts recoverable through future operations and sale of the Property on an undiscounted basis are below depreciated cost.  At that time, Property investments themselves are reduced to estimated fair value (using the fair market value based on comparative sales) when the Property is considered to be impaired and the depreciated cost exceeds estimated fair value. 		 

At the time management commits to a plan to dispose of a specific asset, said asset is adjusted to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  These assets are classified as property and equipment-held for sale and are not depreciated.  Property and equipment that are held for sale are included in discontinued operations.  There are no assets classified as property and equipment-held for sale as of September 30, 2016. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership has not recorded any loss on impairment of assets.  Through September 30, 2016, the Partnership has recorded approximately $35,686,000 as an aggregate loss on impairment of property.

Revenue Recognition 

Rental income is earned primarily under standard residential operating leases and is typically due the first day of each month, but can vary by Property due to the terms of the tenant leases.  Rental income is recognized when earned and charged to tenants  accounts receivable if not received by the due date.  Rental payments received in advance of the due date are deferred until earned.  Rental subsidies are recognized as rental income during the month in which it is earned. 

Other revenues are recorded when earned and consist of the following items:  interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and cash held in escrow balances, income from forfeited security deposits, late charges, laundry and vending income and other rental related items.   

Income Taxes 

The Partnership is not required to provide for, or pay, any federal income taxes.  Net income or loss generated by the Partnership is passed through to the partners and is required to be reported by them.  The Partnership may be subject to state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.  For income tax purposes, the Partnership s year end is December 31. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

Not applicable. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   

(a) 
			 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  The President (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer of Related Independence L.L.C, the general partner of the Partnership, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.     

(b) 
			 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.  During the period ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
