SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

Certain statements in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are
 forward-looking statements  for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any projections or expectations
of earnings, revenue, financial performance, liquidity and capital resources or other financial items; any statement of our plans,
strategies and objectives for our future operations; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements
of belief; and any statements of assumption underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words  may, 
 will,   should,   could,   would,   predicts,   potential, 
 continue,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans, 
 believes,   estimates  and other similar words. Although Cadus Corporation (the  Company )
believes that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, such forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of the
Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties
relating to the Company s ability to acquire residential homes or land for renovation or construction and resale, the Company s
ability to engage contractors to perform such renovation and construction, the Company s ability to sell such renovated or
new homes at a profit, the Company s ability to acquire or invest in other businesses or assets, the Company s capital
needs and uncertainty of future funding, as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
made only as of the date hereof and the Company does not have or undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances unless otherwise required by law.

Statements (Unaudited)  

Note - 1   Organization and Basis of Preparation  

The information presented as of
September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods then ended is unaudited, but includes all adjustments (consisting only
of normal recurring accruals) that the Company s management believes to be necessary for the fair presentation of results for the
periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to the requirements of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the Company believes that the disclosures included in these financial statements
are adequate to make the information not misleading. The December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from
audited consolidated financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Cadus and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cadus Technologies, Inc., Blivet LLC, MB 2013 LLC and Happy Dragon
LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company operates in one segment: the
purchase of homes and land for purposes of renovation or construction and resale. The Company has decided not to maintain its drug
discovery technologies. 

The results of operations for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016. 

Note - 2   Cash Equivalents  

The Company includes as cash equivalents
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were
cash equivalents of $6,414,496 at September 30, 2016 and there were cash equivalents of $8,701,601 at December 31, 2015. 

Note - 3   Net (Loss) Per Share  

Basic net (loss) per share is computed
by dividing the net (loss) by the weighted average of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based
on the weighted average of common shares outstanding plus the effect of common stock equivalents (stock options). There were no
outstanding stock options for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note - 4   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company uses financial instruments
in the normal course of its business. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents and accrued expenses approximate fair value.
The fair value of the Company s investment in a privately held company is not readily available. The 

CADUS CORPORATION  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

Note - 4   Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)  

Company believes the fair value
of this investment in a privately held company approximated its carrying value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Note - 5   Real Estate Operations  

In connection with the Company s
program to purchase residential properties for purposes of renovation or construction and resale, as of September 30, 2016, the
Company had purchased for an aggregate original price of approximately $29.9 million, and continued to own, through two indirect
wholly-owned subsidiaries, twelve residential properties in Miami-Dade County, Florida and one residential property in East Hampton,
New York. 

The company incurred $103,699 in
real estate expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $45,628 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisting
of utilities, maintenance, insurance, taxes and other operating costs and expenses with respect to properties owned. 

Real estate inventory is recorded
at cost. The cost of residential property includes the purchase price of the property, legal fees and other acquisition costs (e.g.
recording, title search, survey, lien and permit searches, and inspection costs). Costs directly related to planning, developing
and constructing a property are capitalized and classified as real estate inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized
development costs include interest, property taxes, insurance, and other direct project costs incurred during the period of development. 

After acquisition, real estate inventory
is analyzed periodically for changes in fair values and any subsequent write down is charged to operating expenses. The Company
did not have such a write down during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note - 6   Accrued Expenses  

Accrued expenses consist of the
following: 

Note - 7   Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

Recent accounting pronouncements
issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future
consolidated financial statements.

Note - 8   Subsequent Events  

The Company has evaluated the impact
of events occurring after September 30, 2016 up to the date of issuance of these consolidated interim financial statements for
adjustment or disclosure. 

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Overview  

The Company seeks opportunities to profit
from the purchase of individual homes or individual residential lots for purposes of renovation or construction and resale. The
Company has completed renovation of two homes - one located at 3506 Main Lodge Road, Coconut Grove, FL, and the other located at
3437 N. Moorings Way, Coconut Grove, FL. The Company has started construction of a new home on its vacant lot located at 2535 Shelter
Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33140 and has obtained permits for construction of a new home at each of the following of its properties:
(i) 700 88th Street, Surfside, FL 33154, (ii) 2555 Shelter Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33140 and (iii) 241 Atlantic Isle, Sunny Isles
Beach, FL 33160. In addition to its real estate activities, the Company may consider acquisitions or investments in other industries. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
an accumulated deficit of approximately $39.2 million. The Company s losses have resulted principally from costs incurred
in connection with its prior biomedical research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated
with the Company s operations. These costs have exceeded the Company s revenues and interest income. The Company expects
to generate revenues in the future only if it is able to profit from its real estate operations. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenues  

There were no revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Costs and Expenses 

General and administrative expenses increased
to $101,396 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $97,325 for the same period in 2015. Professional and consulting
fees decreased by $7,515. Rent decreased by $3,150 due to the Company no longer leasing storage space. In 2015, when the Company
terminated a patent license, the accrued amount payable by the Company for such license was reduced by $12,500. There were other
net increases of $2,236. 

Real estate expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $45,912 consisting of maintenance and utilities for properties owned. Real estate expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 were $13,933. The expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 include real estate
taxes and insurance on the completely renovated property. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a loss of $81 and a gain of $8, respectively, in its investment in Laurel Partners Limited
Partnership. 

Interest Income 

Interest income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $5,727 compared to interest income of $255 for the same period in 2015. This increase is attributable primarily
to an increase in interest rates. 

Results of Operations (continued)  

Net (Loss)  

Net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $143,329 compared to a net loss of $99,040 for the same period in 2015. The increase in net loss can be principally
attributed to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,071, an increase in real estate expenses of $31,979, an
increase in amortization of website of $1,667, an increase in provision for income taxes $11,955, and a decrease in gain from other
ventures of $89, offset by an increase in interest income of $5,472. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenues  

There were no revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Costs and Expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased
to $385,266 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $422,230 for the same period in 2015. Professional and consulting
fees decreased by $22,730. Patent costs and license fees decreased by $16,272 due to the Company no longer maintaining its drug
discovery technologies. Rent decreased by $7,350 due to the Company no longer leasing storage space. In connection with closing
of the storage facility, the Company paid $6,266 for the shredding and transferring of records. There were other net increases
of $3,122. 

Real estate expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $103,699 consisting of maintenance and utilities for properties owned. Real estate expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $45,628. The expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include real estate
taxes and insurance on the completely renovated property. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a gain of $152 and a loss of $431, respectively, in its investment in Laurel Partners Limited
Partnership. 

Results of Operations (continued)  

Interest Income 

 Interest income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $14,227 compared to interest income of $1,203 for the same period in 2015. This increase is attributable
primarily to an increase in interest rates. 

Net (Loss)  

Net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $479,586 compared to a net loss of $455,131 for the same period in 2015. The increase in net loss can be attributed
to an increase in real estate expenses of $58,071, an increase in amortization of website of $5,000 and an increase in provision
for income taxes of $11,955, offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $36,964, an increase in gain from equity
in other ventures of $583 and an increase in interest income of $13,024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2016, the Company held
cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 million. 

Depending on the availability of transactions
acceptable to the Company in connection with its real estate activities, all or a portion of the Company s available cash
may be utilized, and the Company may seek debt or additional equity financing. The Company s capital requirements may vary
as a result of a number of factors, including the transactions, if any, arising from the Company s efforts to acquire, renovate,
construct and sell residential properties. There can be no assurance that the Company will raise sufficient capital on a timely
basis or on satisfactory terms or at all to meet such capital requirements. 

Item 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

Under SEC regulations, the Company is considered
a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Based on the evaluation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures conducted as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q, the Company s
President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Treasurer (who performs functions similar to those of a principal
financial officer), concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. In addition, there has been no change in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. It should be noted that any system of controls, however
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance, and not absolute assurance, that the objectives of the system
are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
