NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Preparation of Interim Financial Statements 
  All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Our reportable segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas ) and International outdoor advertising ( International ). The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, in the opinion of management, include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of the interim periods shown. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations.  Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  Due to seasonality and other factors, the results for the interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year.  The financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and give effect to allocations of expenses from the Company s indirect parent entity, iHeartCommunications, Inc. ( iHeartCommunications ).  These allocations were made on a specifically identifiable basis or using relative percentages of headcount or other methods management considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided.  Also included in the consolidated financial statements are entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary.  Investments in companies in which the Company owns 20% to 50% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies of the company are accounted for under the equity method.  All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process.  Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  
      
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  During the second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   This update provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, the Company will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . This new standard eliminates the deferral of FAS 167, which has allowed entities with interest in certain investment funds to follow the previous consolidation guidance in FIN 46(R) and makes other changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . This update simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs as a deduction from the carrying value of the outstanding debt balance rather than showing the debt issuance costs as an asset.  The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The retrospective adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of debt issuance costs of   $50.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , which are now reflected as  Long-term debt fees  in Note 3.  
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  . This update provides a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

  (UNAUDITED) 

During the third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  . This update eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . The new leasing standard presents significant changes to the balance sheets of lessees. Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard which was issued in the third quarter of 2015. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.     
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  . This update changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.  Income tax effects of share-based payment awards will be recognized in the income statement with the vesting or settlement of the awards and the record keeping for additional paid-in capital pools will no longer be necessary.  Additionally, companies can make a policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they occur. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losse  s   (Topic 326)  . The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to  use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. For an SEC filer, the standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  . The new standard addresses the classification of cash flows related to certain cash receipts and cash payments.  Additionally, the standard clarifies  how the predominance principle should be used when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. First, an entity will apply the guidance in Topic 230 and other applicable topics. If there is no guidance for those cash receipts and cash payments, an entity will determine each separately identifiable source or use and classify the receipt or payment based on the nature of the cash flow. If a receipt or payment has aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, the classification will depend on the predominant source of use. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 2   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL 
  Dispositions 
  During the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold   nine   non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds, which included cash and certain advertising assets in Florida, totaling   $592.6 million  . The Company recognized a net gain of   $278.3 million   related to the sale, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor also entered into an agreement to sell its Indianapolis, Indiana market in exchange for certain assets in Atlanta, Georgia, plus approximately   $41.2 million   in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in 2016. This transaction has met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale and as such, the related assets are separately presented on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the second quarter of 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Turkey.  As a result, the Company recognized a net loss of   $56.6 million  , which includes   $32.2 million   in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon the sale of the Company's subsidiaries in Turkey.      
  On October 24, 2016, the Company sold its International outdoor business in Australia ( Australia Outdoor ), for cash proceeds of   $203.9 million  .  As of September 30, 2016, Australia Outdoor had   $48.6 million   in current assets,   $56.2 million   in property, plant   equipment,   $5.7 million   in other assets,   $31.1 million   in current liabilities and   $9.0 million   in long-term liabilities. Australia Outdoor revenue, direct expenses, SG A expenses and depreciation and amortization for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $96.0 million  ,   $56.2 million  ,   $18.5 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively, and   $83.6 million  ,   $51.9 million  ,   $16.1 million   and   $7.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  The Company s property, plant and equipment consisted of the following classes of assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
  The Company s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of billboard permits in its Americas segment. Due to significant differences in both business practices and regulations, billboards in the International segment are subject to long-term, finite contracts unlike the Company s permits in the United States and Canada.  Accordingly, there are no indefinite-lived intangible assets in the International segment.  
    
  Annual Impairment Test on Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
  The Company performs its annual impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1 of each year.    
    
  The impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of a comparison between the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset at the market level with its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess.  After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the indefinite-lived asset is its new accounting basis.  The fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is determined using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99.  Under the direct valuation method, the fair value of the indefinite-lived assets is calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35. The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm, to assist it in the development of the assumptions and the Company s determination of the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
    
  The application of the direct valuation method attempts to isolate the income that is properly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible asset alone (that is, apart from tangible and identified intangible assets and goodwill).  It is based upon modeling a hypothetical  greenfield  build-up to a  normalized  enterprise that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose only other assets have essentially been paid for (or added) as part of the build-up process.  The Company forecasts revenue, expenses and cash flows over a ten-year period for each of its markets in its application of the direct valuation method.  The Company also calculates a  normalized  residual year which represents the perpetual cash flows of each market.  The residual year cash flow was capitalized to arrive at the terminal value of the permits in each market.

  (UNAUDITED) 

Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically develops indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch.  Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value.  Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flow model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
    
  The key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, market share, profit margin, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up capital costs and losses incurred during the build-up period, the risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal values.  This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average billboard permit within a market. 
    
  The Company concluded no impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was required for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company recognized an impairment charge related to its indefinite-lived intangible assets of   $21.6 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to billboard permits in   one   market.  
    
  Other Intangible Assets 
  Other intangible assets include definite-lived intangible assets and permanent easements.  The Company s definite-lived intangible assets primarily include transit and street furniture contracts, site-leases and other contractual rights, all of which are amortized over the shorter of either the respective lives of the agreements or over the period of time the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the Company s future cash flows.  Permanent easements are indefinite-lived intangible assets which include certain rights to use real property not owned by the Company.  The Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the amortization periods related to its definite-lived intangible assets.  These assets are recorded at cost. 
    
  The following table presents the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for each major class of other intangible assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

Total amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $9.3 million   and   $11.1 million  , respectively.  Total amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $29.2 million   and   $38.3 million  , respectively. 
    
  As acquisitions and dispositions occur in the future, amortization expense may vary.  The following table presents the Company s estimate of amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years for definite-lived intangible assets:

Goodwill 
  Annual Impairment Test to Goodwill 
  The Company performs its annual impairment test on goodwill as of July 1 of each year.  
    
  Each of the Company s advertising markets are components.  The U.S. advertising markets are aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test using the guidance in ASC 350-20-55.  The Company also determined that each country within its Americas segment and its International segment constitutes a separate reporting unit. 
    
  The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step, used to screen for potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If applicable, the second step, used to measure the amount of the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. 
    
  Each of the Company s reporting units is valued using a discounted cash flow model which requires estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the reporting unit and discounting such cash flows to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate.  Terminal values were also estimated and discounted to their present value.  Assessing the recoverability of goodwill requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates based on its budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors.   
    
  The Company recognized goodwill impairment of   $7.3 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 
  related to   one   market in the Company's International outdoor segment and concluded no goodwill impairment charge was required for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
   The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in each of the Company s reportable segments:

NOTE 3   LONG-TERM DEBT 
    
  Long-term debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

(1) 
     The Senior revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to   $75.0 million   (the revolving credit commitment). As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $53.7 million   of letters of credit outstanding, and   $21.3 million   of availability, under the senior revolving credit facility. 
       
  The aggregate market value of the Company s debt based on market prices for which quotes were available was approximately   $5.2 billion   and   $4.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Under the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820-10-35, the market value of the Company s debt is classified as Level 1. 
    
  Surety Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $54.9 million   and   $59.9 million   in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding, respectively. Bank guarantees of   $26.1 million   were backed by cash collateral. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , iHeartCommunications had outstanding commercial standby letters of credit and surety bonds of   $1.2 million   and   $53.6 million  , respectively, held on behalf of the Company.  These surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees relate to various operational matters, including insurance, bid and performance bonds, as well as other items. 

NOTE 4   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.  It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in the Company s assumptions or the effectiveness of its strategies related to these proceedings.  Additionally, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Although the Company is involved in a variety of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, a large portion of the Company s litigation arises in the following contexts: commercial disputes; misappropriation of likeness and right of publicity claims; employment and benefits related claims; governmental fines; intellectual property claims; and tax disputes.

  Stockholder Litigation 
  On May 9, 2016, a stockholder of the Company filed a derivative lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned GAMC  O Asset Management Inc. v. iHeartMedia Inc. et al.,   C.A. No. 12312-VCS.  The complaint names as defendants iHeartCommunications, Inc. ( iHeartCommunications ), the Company s indirect parent company, iHeartMedia, Inc. ( iHeartMedia ), the parent company of iHeartCommunications, Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (together, the  Sponsor Defendants ), iHeartMedia s private equity sponsors and majority owners, and the members of the Company s board of directors.  The Company also is named as a nominal defendant.  The complaint alleges that the Company has been harmed by the intercompany agreements with iHeartCommunications, the Company s lack of autonomy over its own cash and the actions of the defendants in serving the interests of iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants to the detriment of the Company and its minority stockholders.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties by causing the Company to: (i) continue to loan cash to iHeartCommunications under the intercompany note at below-market rates; (ii) abandon its growth and acquisition strategies in favor of transactions that would provide cash to iHeartMedia and iHeartCommunications; (iii) issue new debt in the CCIBV note offering (the  CCIBV Note Offering ) to provide cash to iHeartMedia and iHeartCommunications through a dividend; and (iv) effect the sales of certain outdoor markets in the U.S. (the  Outdoor Asset Sales ) to provide cash to iHeartMedia and iHeartCommunications through a dividend.  The complaint also alleges that iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants aided and abetted the directors  breaches of their fiduciary duties.  The complaint further alleges that iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants were unjustly enriched as a result of these transactions and that these transactions constituted a waste of corporate assets for which the defendants are liable to the Company.  The plaintiff is seeking, among other things, a ruling that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and that iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants aided and abetted the board of directors  breaches of fiduciary duty, rescission of payments to iHeartCommunications and its affiliates pursuant to dividends declared in connection with the CCIBV Note Offering and Outdoor Asset Sales, and an order requiring iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants to disgorge all profits they have received as a result of the alleged fiduciary misconduct.   
    
  On May 26, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking expedited discovery and an expedited trial on certain counts of its complaint.  On June 27, 2016, the court denied the motion for an expedited trial and discovery, and on July 12, 2016, the parties stipulated to a schedule that would allow for a decision on the defendants  forthcoming motion to dismiss by mid-September and a trial, if necessary, beginning February 27, 2017.  On July 20, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's verified stockholder derivative complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A hearing was held on defendants' motion to dismiss on September 12, 2016. The court has not yet ruled on the motion.

  Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
    
  The Company s income tax benefit (expense) for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, consisted of the following components: 

The effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   13.2%   and   40.1%  , respectively. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against net operating losses in U.S. federal and state jurisdictions due to taxable gains from the dispositions of   nine   outdoor markets during the period.  The effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily impacted by the Company's inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions due to uncertainty regarding the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. 
    
  The effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   60.0%   and   33.6%  , respectively. The effective rates were primarily impacted by the valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets that consisted of net operating losses in U.S. federal, state and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The Company recorded a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets as the reversing deferred tax liabilities and other sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the deferred tax assets were exceeded by deferred tax assets recognized on the additional net operating losses incurred in the period.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Format of Presentation 
  Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations ( MD A ) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis.  All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to  we,   us  and  our  refer to Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Our reportable segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas ) and International outdoor advertising ( International ).  Our Americas and International segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   presentation. 
    
  We manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on the Revolving Promissory Note issued by iHeartCommunications to the Company (the  Due from iHeartCommunications Note ), Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results. 
    
  Management typically monitors our businesses by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.  Our advertising revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the displays we own or operate in key markets worldwide, consisting primarily of billboards, street furniture and transit displays.  Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients  advertisements.  We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally. 
    
  Advertising revenue for our segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP ) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally.  Internationally, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. 
    
  Executive Summary 
  The key developments that impacted our business during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   are summarized below: 
              
    In the first quarter, we sold nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets and in the second quarter we sold our outdoor business in Turkey.  These markets generated revenue of   $32.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
       
  Revenues and expenses  excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements  in this Management s Discussion   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are presented because management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period to period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors.  Revenues and expenses  excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements  are calculated by converting the current period s revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  The comparison of our historical results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is as follows: 

Consolidated Revenue 
  Consolidated revenue   decreased     $23.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .

Revenue growth by our International business was more than offset by lower revenue resulting from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and our Turkey market in the second quarter of 2016.  These markets generated $32.8 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2015.    
    
  Consolidated revenue   decreased     $58.2 million   during   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding a   $27.2 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue   decreased     $31.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .   Revenue generated by our Americas and International outdoor businesses decreased as a result of the sale of non-strategic outdoor markets which generated $95.8 million in revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $13.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    
  
   26

Lower direct operating expenses in our Americas outdoor business was due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2016.  The decrease in direct operating expenses in our International outdoor business related primarily to the loss of the London bus contract, lower site lease expense and the second quarter sale of our business in Turkey, partially offset by increases primarily related to higher revenues in other countries.    
    
  Consolidated direct operating expenses   decreased     $32.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $18.2 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses   decreased     $14.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .   Lower direct operating expenses in our Americas outdoor business was due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets in the first quarter of 2016.  The decrease in direct operating expenses in our International outdoor business related primarily to the loss of the London bus contract and the sale of our business in Turkey, partially offset by increases primarily related to higher revenues in other countries.    
    
  Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses 
  Consolidated SG A expenses   decreased     $6.4 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .

Lower SG A expenses were primarily driven by the sale of non-strategic outdoor markets in the first and second quarters of 2016.    
    
  Consolidated SG A expenses   decreased     $3.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .

  Interest income   decreased     $3.2 million   and   $9.5 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015   due to a lower average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note. 
    
  Other income (expense), net 
  Other   expense  , net of   $6.5 million   and   $46.2 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, related primarily to net foreign exchange losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies, particularly euro denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries. 
    
  Other   income   (expense), net of ($17.7) million and   $17.5 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily related to foreign exchange gains or losses on short-term intercompany accounts.

Income tax expense 
  Our operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia.  However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries. 
    
  The effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   13.2%   and   40.1%  , respectively. The effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily impacted by the Company's inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions due to uncertainty regarding the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against net operating losses in U.S. federal and state jurisdictions due to taxable gains from the dispositions of nine outdoor markets during the period. 
    
  The effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   60.0%   and   33.6%  , respectively, and were primarily impacted by the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets from net operating losses in U.S. federal, state and certain foreign jurisdictions due to uncertainty regarding the ability to realize those assets in future periods.  
     
  Americas Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations 
    
  Our Americas outdoor operating results were as follows: 

Three Months 
    
  Americas revenue   decreased     $24.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $0.1 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue   decreased     $24.4 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .   In the first quarter of 2016, we sold nine non-strategic U.S. markets which generated revenues of $27.9 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards as a result of new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, new airport contracts and higher revenues in Latin America, primarily as a result of the Olympics in Brazil.    
    
  Americas direct operating expenses   decreased     $6.1 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $0.4 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses   decreased     $6.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  . The sale of non-strategic U.S. markets resulted in a $9.3 million decrease in direct operating expenses. This decrease was partially offset by higher direct variable operating expenses resulting from higher revenues and higher variable site lease expenses related to new airport contracts.   Americas SG A expenses   decreased     $5.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  . Excluding the   $0.1 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG A expenses   decreased     $4.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  . Lower SG A expenses was primarily due to a $5.2 million decrease in SG A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016.    
    
  Nine   Months 
    
  Americas revenue   decreased     $53.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $7.8 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue   decreased     $45.6  
  
   29 

million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The decrease in revenue is primarily due to the $74.8 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards as a result of new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, higher revenues in Latin America, primarily due to the Olympics in Brazil, as well as higher revenues from print bulletins and new airport contracts.    
    
  Americas direct operating expenses   decreased     $24.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $3.8 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses   decreased     $20.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The decrease in direct operating expenses was primarily driven by a $26.2 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable site lease expenses related to the increase in revenues from remaining markets.   Americas SG A expenses   decreased     $4.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $2.1 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG A expenses   decreased     $2.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease in SG A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense related to higher revenues, higher property taxes expense and higher research and development costs.    
    
  International Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations 
    
  Our International operating results were as follows: 

Three Months 
    
  International revenue   increased     $1.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $6.0 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue   increased     $7.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase in revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth from new digital assets and new contracts in Australia, Italy, Spain and Sweden, partially offset by lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed and the sale of our Turkey market during the second quarter of 2016.    
    
  International direct operating expenses   decreased     $0.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $4.6 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses   increased     $4.1 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase in direct operating expenses was primarily a result of higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth, partially offset by lower site lease expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed, lower direct operating expenses as a result of the sale our Turkey market during the second quarter of 2016 and site lease termination fees incurred in the third quarter of 2015 related to our strategic efficiency initiatives.   International SG A expenses   decreased     $1.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $1.3 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG A expenses were flat during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . An increase in SG A expenses related to higher selling staff costs in countries experiencing growth was offset by a reduction in SG A expenses resulting from the sale of the business in Turkey during the second quarter of 2016.

Nine   Months 
    
  International revenue   decreased     $4.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $19.4 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue   increased     $14.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase in revenue is due to growth in Australia, France, Italy, China and Sweden, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts, which was partially offset by lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed.    
    
  International direct operating expenses   decreased     $8.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $14.4 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses   increased     $6.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase was primarily a result of higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth, partially offset by lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed.   International SG A expenses   increased     $1.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Excluding the   $4.5 million   impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG A expenses   increased     $5.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to higher sales force and office renovation costs in Australia and the United Kingdom.    
    
  Reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Consolidated Operating Income  

(1) 
    Corporate and other includes expenses related to Americas and International as well as overall executive, administrative and support functions. 
       
  Share-Based Compensation Expense 
  Certain employees receive equity awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was $17.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements that will vest based on service conditions.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 4.2 years.  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , there was $0.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements that will vest based on market, performance and service conditions.  This cost will be recognized when it becomes probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. 
    
  Share-based compensation expenses are recorded in corporate expenses and were   $2.7 million   and   $2.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $8.1 million   and   $6.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following discussion highlights cash flow activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016 and 2015: 

Operating Activities 
  Cash   provided by   operating activities was   $190.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $126.2 million   of cash provided during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to changes in working capital balances, particularly accounts receivable, which was driven primarily by improved collections.   
  Investing Activities 
  Cash   provided by   investing activities of   $411.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily reflected net cash proceeds from the sale of nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds, which included cash and certain advertising assets in Florida, totaling   $592.6 million  . Those sale proceeds were partially offset by our capital expenditures of   $148.0 million  .  We spent   $47.8 million   in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays,   $97.5 million   in our International segment primarily related to new advertising structures such as billboards and street furniture and renewals of existing contracts and   $2.7 million   in Corporate primarily related to equipment and software purchases. 
    
  Cash used for investing activities of $134.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflected our capital expenditures of $138.6 million.  We spent $50.9 million in our Americas segment primarily related to the construction of new advertising structures such as digital displays and $85.5 million in our International segment primarily related to new advertising structures such as billboards and street furniture and renewals of existing contracts and   $2.2 million   in Corporate primarily related to equipment and software purchases.  Other cash used for investing activities was partially offset by $8.5 million of proceeds from sales of other operating and fixed assets. 
    
  Financing Activities 
  Cash   used for   financing activities of   $619.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily reflected two cash dividends paid in the aggregate amount of   $755.1 million  , partially offset by net transfers of   $161.3 million   in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the  Due from iHeartCommunications  account. 
    
  Cash provided by financing activities of $5.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflected net transfers of $34.1 million in cash from iHeartCommunications, which represents the activity in the  Due from iHeartCommunications  account, partially offset by the net payments to noncontrolling interests of $28.1 million. 

Anticipated Cash Requirements  
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, the revolving promissory note with iHeartCommunications and our senior revolving credit facility, and, to the extent we use cash to support iHeartCommunications  liquidity needs in the future, cash from liquidity-generating transactions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $394.3 million   of cash on our balance sheet, including $154.1 million of cash held outside the U.S. by our subsidiaries, a portion of which is held by non-wholly owned subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to certain restrictions and not readily accessible to us.  We have the ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of consolidated subsidiaries based outside of the United States.  If any excess cash held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the United States, we could presently repatriate available funds without a requirement to accrue or pay U.S. taxes.  This is a result of significant deficits, as calculated for tax law  
  
   32 

purposes, in our foreign earnings and profits, which gives us flexibility to make future cash distributions as non-taxable returns of capital. 
    
  Our primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, special dividend and other funding requirements.  Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, cash flows from operations, repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note with iHeartCommunications and borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, special dividend and other funding requirements, including the debt service on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes, for at least the next 12 months.  We believe our long-term plans, which include promoting outdoor media spending, capitalizing on our diverse geographic and product opportunities and the continued deployment of digital displays, will enable us to continue generating cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our liquidity and funding requirements long term.  However, our anticipated results are subject to significant uncertainty. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, special dividend and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations.  If our future operating performance does not meet our expectations or our plans materially change in an adverse manner or prove to be materially inaccurate, we may need additional financing.  We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $757.8 million in special cash dividends to our stockholders.  As described under  Uses of Capital-Special Dividends  below, in the first quarter of 2016, we paid a $217.8 million dividend from the proceeds of the issuance of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 by Clear Channel International B.V. ( CCIBV ), one of our indirect subsidiaries, and a $540.0 million dividend with the proceeds of a $300 million repayment under the Due from iHeartCommunications note and the sale of our outdoor business in nine non-strategic markets.  The payment of these special dividends reduced the amount of cash available to us for future working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements.    Similarly, the repayment of the $300.0 million under the Due from iHeartCommunications note reduced the amount of the Due from iHeartCommunications note asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity.  In addition, the interest payments that we receive under the Due from iHeartCommunications note are expected to be lower in 2016 than in 2015 as a result of the lower outstanding indebtedness on the note. Future special cash dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, our having sufficient available cash. 
    
  In addition to any special dividends that our board of directors may declare using the proceeds of any liquidity-generating transactions or other available cash, we may declare special dividends using the proceeds of payments from iHeartCommunications under the Due from iHeartCommunications note.  Our board of directors has established a committee that has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications  liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded.  Any future repayments and dividends would further reduce the amount of the Due from iHeartCommunications note asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. 
    
  As our controlling stockholder, iHeartCommunications may request and may exert pressure on us to engage in transactions for the purpose of supporting its liquidity needs, such as financings or asset sales, which may negatively affect our business operations or our capital structure.  In its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on   November 9, 2016  , iHeartCommunications stated that its ability to continue to meet its working capital, debt service, capital expenditures and other funding requirements for the next 12 months depends on, among other things, its ability to generate additional cash from liquidity-generating transactions, and that it is currently exploring, and expects to continue to explore, a variety of transactions to provide it with additional liquidity.  iHeartCommunications stated that there is no assurance that any of the liquidity-generating transactions it is currently exploring will close in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to it, or at all, and that if one or more of these transactions do not occur as expected, it could cause a default under one or more of the agreements governing its indebtedness.  These liquidity-generating transactions may involve us or our assets.  If these transactions involve us or our assets, they could have the effect of increasing our annual cash interest payment obligations, reducing our operating income, reducing our cash flow from operations, reducing cash available for capital expenditures and other business initiatives or impacting the value of our common stock.   
    
  iHeartCommunications provides the day-to-day cash management services for our cash activities and balances in the U.S.  We do not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications, and iHeartCommunications is not required to provide us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements.  We have no access to the cash transferred from us to iHeartCommunications under the cash management arrangement other than our right to demand payment by iHeartCommunications of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications note.  As of   September 30, 2016  , iHeartCommunications had   $542.9 million   recorded as  Cash and cash equivalents  on its consolidated balance sheets, of which   $394.3 million   was held by us and our subsidiaries, and we had   $769.5 million   due to us from  
  
   33 

iHeartCommunications under the Due from iHeartCommunications note.  Further deterioration in the financial condition or liquidity of iHeartCommunications could result in its inability to repay amounts due to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications note when demanded or at maturity, and could also have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs or impairing our access to capital markets.  If iHeartCommunications were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, we would be an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications.  In that event, we would be treated the same as other unsecured creditors of iHeartCommunications and, if we were not entitled to amounts outstanding or previously paid under the revolving promissory note, or could not obtain cash previously transferred to iHeartCommunications on a timely basis or retain cash previously received from iHeartCommunications, we could experience a liquidity shortfall. 
    
  In its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on   November 9, 2016  , iHeartCommunications stated that it was in compliance with the covenants contained in its material financing agreements as of September 30, 2016.  iHeartCommunications similarly stated in its Quarterly Report that its future results are also subject to significant uncertainty and there can be no assurance it will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. Moreover, iHeartCommunications stated in its Quarterly Report that its ability to comply with the covenants in its material financing agreements may be affected by events beyond its control, including the uncertainties described under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Anticipated Cash Requirements" in its Quarterly Report and prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.  As discussed therein, the breach of any covenants set forth in iHeartCommunications  financing agreements would result in a default thereunder, and an event of default would permit the lenders under a defaulted financing agreement to declare all indebtedness thereunder to be immediately due and payable. In addition, iHeartCommunications stated in its Quarterly Report that if iHeartCommunications is unable to repay its obligations under any secured credit facility, the lenders could proceed against any assets that were pledged to secure such facility.  Finally, iHeartCommunications stated in its Quarterly Report that a default or acceleration under any of its material financing agreements could cause a default under other obligations that are subject to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.   
    
  We frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business.  We expect from time to time to pursue additional acquisitions and may decide to dispose of certain businesses.  These acquisitions or dispositions could be material. 
    
  On October 24, 2016, the Company sold its International outdoor business in Australia ( Australia Outdoor ), for cash proceeds of   $203.9 million  .   
    
  Sources of Capital 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had the following debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from iHeartCommunications: 

(1)  The senior revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $75.0 million (the revolving credit commitment). As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $53.7 million   of letters of credit outstanding, and   $21.3 million   of availability, under the senior revolving credit facility. 

34 

We may from time to time repay our outstanding debt or seek to purchase our outstanding equity securities.  Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
    
  Promissory Notes with iHeartCommunications 
  We maintain accounts that represent net amounts due to or from iHeartCommunications, which are recorded as  Due from iHeartCommunications  on our consolidated balance sheets.  The accounts represent our revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications and the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us, in each case in the face amount of $1.0 billion, or if more or less than such amount, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances.  The accounts accrue interest pursuant to the terms of the promissory notes and are generally payable on demand or when they mature on December 15, 2017.  Included in the accounts are the net activities resulting from day-to-day cash management services provided by iHeartCommunications.  Such day-to-day cash management services relate only to our cash activities and balances in the U.S. and exclude any cash activities and balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the asset recorded in  Due from iHeartCommunications  on our consolidated balance sheet was   $769.5 million   and   $930.8 million  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings under the revolving promissory note to iHeartCommunications.  On February 4, 2016, our board of directors made a demand under the Due from iHeartCommunications note in the amount of $300.0 million, reducing the amount outstanding and used the repayment to partially fund a special cash dividend. 
    
  In accordance with the terms of the settlement for the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications note, as previously disclosed, we established a committee of our board of directors, consisting of our independent and disinterested directors, for the specific purpose of monitoring the Due from iHeartCommunications note.  This committee has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications  liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded.  The committee last made a demand under the Due from iHeartCommunications note on August 11, 2014.  If future demands are made in accordance with the terms of the committee charter, we will declare a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded, which would further reduce the amount of the  Due from iHeartCommunications  asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. 
    
  The net interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   $12.4 million   and   $15.6 million  , respectively. The net interest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   $36.4 million   and   $45.9 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fixed interest rate on the  Due from iHeartCommunications  account was 6.5%, which is equal to the fixed interest rate on the CCWH Senior Notes. If the outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note exceeds $1.0 billion and under certain other circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications  liquidity, the rate will be variable but will in no event be less than 6.5% nor greater than 20%. 
    
  Our working capital requirements and capital for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, may be provided to us by iHeartCommunications, in its sole discretion, pursuant to a revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications or pursuant to repayment of the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us.  If we are unable to obtain financing from iHeartCommunications, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements at some future date.  As stated above, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms or at all. 
    
  As long as iHeartCommunications maintains a significant interest in us, pursuant to the Master Agreement between iHeartCommunications and us, iHeartCommunications will have the option to limit our ability to incur debt or issue equity securities, among other limitations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs.  Under the Master Agreement with iHeartCommunications, we are limited in our borrowings from third parties to no more than $400.0 million at any one time outstanding, without the prior written consent of iHeartCommunications. 
    
     Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings Senior Notes 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , CCWH senior notes represented $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consisted of $735.75 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Series A Senior Notes due 2022 (the  Series A CCWH Senior Notes ) and $1,989.25 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Series B CCWH Senior Notes due 2022 (the  Series B CCWH Senior Notes  and, together with the Series A CCWH Senior Notes, the  CCWH Senior Notes ). The CCWH Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. ( CCOI ) and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.

The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. Under this test, in order to incur additional indebtedness, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively, and in order to incur additional indebtedness that is subordinated to the CCWH Senior Notes, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture also restricts our ability to pay dividends, but permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the proceeds from asset sales if our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indenture) are lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively. The Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture also contains certain other exceptions that allow us to pay dividends, including (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. 
    
  Our consolidated leverage ratio, defined as total debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was   7.5  :1 as of   September 30, 2016  , and senior leverage ratio, defined as senior debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was   4.0  :1 as of   September 30, 2016  . As required by the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures, our EBITDA for the preceding four quarters of   $690.2 million   is calculated as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and gains and losses on acquisitions and divestitures plus share-based compensation and is further adjusted for the following: (i) costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities; (ii) extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses; (iii) non-cash charges; and (iv) various other items.  Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture.  There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends.

Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings Senior Subordinated Notes 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , CCWH Subordinated Notes represented $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consist of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the  Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes ) and $1,925.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the  Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes ). 
    
  The Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the proceeds from asset sales if our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indenture) is lower than 7.0:1. Because our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio exceeded the thresholds in the indentures as of September 30, 2016, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes Indenture and the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture.  The Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture contains certain other exceptions that allow us to incur indebtedness and pay dividends, including (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note.  The Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends.

Senior Revolving Credit Facility Due 2018 
  During the third quarter of 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million.  The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs, to issue letters of credit and for other general corporate purposes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and   $53.7 million   of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility which reduce availability under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a springing covenant that requires us to maintain a secured leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of not more than 1.5:1 that is tested at the end of a quarter if availability under the facility is less than 75% of the aggregate commitments under the facility.  We were in compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenant as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  CCIBV Senior Notes 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, Clear Channel International B.V., an international subsidiary of ours, issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( CCIBV Senior Notes ). 
    
  The indenture governing the CCIBV Senior Notes contains covenants that limit Clear Channel International B.V. s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) create liens on assets; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; and (vii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of CCIBV s assets. 
    
  Other Debt 
  Other debt consists primarily of capital leases and loans with international banks.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $18.4 million   was outstanding as other debt. 
    
  iHeartCommunications  Debt Covenants 
  iHeartCommunications  senior secured credit facility contains a significant financial covenant which must be tested quarterly and requires iHeartCommunications to limit the ratio of its consolidated secured debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to consolidated EBITDA (as defined by iHeartCommunications  senior secured credit facility) for the preceding four quarters.  The maximum ratio permitted under this financial covenant was 8.75:1 for the four quarters ended   September 30, 2016  .  In its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on   November 9, 2016  , iHeartCommunications stated that it was in compliance with this covenant as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Disposals 
  In the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $  592.6 million   in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. 
  In the second quarter of 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Turkey.  As a result, we recognized a net loss of $56.6 million, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon sale of the subsidiaries in Turkey.   
  On October 24, 2016, we sold our International outdoor business in Australia, for cash proceeds of   $203.9 million  .   
  Uses of Capital 
  Special Dividends 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $757.8 million in special cash dividends to our stockholders.  In the first quarter of 2016, we paid a $217.8 million dividend from the proceeds of the issuance of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 by CCIBV, one of our indirect subsidiaries, and a $540.0 million dividend with the proceeds of a $300.0 million repayment under the Due from iHeartCommunications note and the sale of our outdoor business in nine non-strategic outdoor markets.  
    
  Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees 
  We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.  It is possible, however, that future  
  
   38 

results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.  Please refer to  Legal Proceedings  in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Seasonality 
  Typically, both our Americas and International segments experience their lowest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, with International historically experiencing a loss from operations in that period.  Our International segment typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year.  We expect this trend to continue in the future.  Due to this seasonality and certain other factors, the results for the interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year. 

MARKET RISK 
  We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in equity security prices and foreign currency exchange rates. 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the  U.K. ) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the  E.U. ), commonly referred to as  Brexit . Our International segment is currently headquartered in the U.K. and transacts business in many key European markets.  The announcement of Brexit caused the British pound currency rate to weaken against the U.S. dollar.  Further, Brexit may create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce the amount they spend on advertising.  Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We have operations in countries throughout the world.  Foreign operations are measured in their local currencies.  As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.  We believe we mitigate a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations with a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Our foreign operations reported a net loss of $22.4 million and $95.6 million for three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  We estimate a 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our net loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   by $2.2 million and decreased our net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   by $9.6 million.  A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   would have increased our net loss by a corresponding amount. 
  This analysis does not consider the implications that such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the U.S. or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities.  
  Inflation 
  Inflation is a factor in the economies in which we do business and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect.  Inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages, salaries and equipment.  Although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable, we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our outdoor display faces.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material.  Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to  
  
   39 

make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions. 
    
  The Company performs its annual impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of July 1 of each year.    
      
  Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our billboard permits, are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99. Under the direct valuation method, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35.  Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch.  Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value.  Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
    
  Our key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, market share, profit margin, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up capital costs and losses incurred during the build-up period, the risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal values.  This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average asset within a market. 
    
  On July 1,   2016  , we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in no impairment charge. 
    
  In determining the fair value of our billboard permits, the following key assumptions were used: 

Industry revenue growth forecast at 3.0% was used for the initial four-year period; 
                
    3.0% revenue growth was assumed beyond the initial four-year period; 
                
    Revenue was grown over a build-up period, reaching maturity by year 2; 
                
    Operating margins gradually climb to the industry average margin of up to 56.1%, depending on market size, by year 3; and 
                
    Assumed discount rate of 7.5%. 
       
  While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur.  If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future.  The following table shows the decline in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption: 

The estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1,   2016   was $4.0 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion.  The estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1,   2015   was $3.1 billion while the carrying value was $1.1 billion.   
    
  Goodwill   
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.  We test goodwill at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.  The fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit.  To the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value, an impairment charge may be required to be recorded. 

40 

The discounted cash flow approach we use for valuing goodwill as part of the two-step impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate.  Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value. 
    
  On July 1,   2016  , we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $7.3 million related to one of our International outdoor markets. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions: 
             
    Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2016 through 2020. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating segments, and reflect the advertising outlook across our businesses. 
                
    Cash flows beyond 2020 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3.0%. 
                
    In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value; we utilized a discount rate of approximately 8.0% to 11.5% for each of our reporting units. 
       
  Based on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in a material impairment condition. 
    
  While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of each of our reportable segments that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:

    the risk that our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives may not be entirely successful or that any cost savings achieved from such strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives may not persist; 
                
    the impact of our substantial indebtedness, including the effect of our leverage on our financial position and earnings; 
                
    our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or liquidity-generating transactions and our need to allocate significant amounts of our cash to make payments on our indebtedness, which in turn could reduce our financial flexibility and ability to fund other activities; 
                
    our relationship with iHeartCommunications, including its ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and its ability as our controlling stockholder to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders and certain additional matters governed by intercompany agreements between us; 
                
    the impact of the above and similar factors on iHeartCommunications, our primary direct or indirect external source of capital, which could have a significant need for capital in the future; and 
                
    certain other factors set forth in our other filings with the SEC. 
       
  This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive.  Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Required information is presented under  Market Risk  within Item 2 of this Part I. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We currently are involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.  It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.  Additionally, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Although we are involved in a variety of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, a large portion of our litigation arises in the following contexts: commercial disputes; misappropriation of likeness and right of publicity claims; employment and benefits related claims; governmental fines; intellectual property claims; and tax disputes. 
    
  International Outdoor Investigation 
    
  On April 21, 2015, inspections were conducted at the premises of the Company in Denmark and Sweden as part of an investigation by Danish competition authorities.  Additionally, on the same day; Clear Channel UK received a communication from the UK competition authorities, also in connection with the investigation by Danish competition authorities. The Company and its affiliates are cooperating with the national competition authorities. 
    
  Stockholder Litigation 
    
  On May 9, 2016, a stockholder of the Company filed a derivative lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   GAMCO Asset Management Inc. v. iHeartMedia Inc. et al.,   C.A. No. 12312-VCS.  The complaint names as defendants iHeartCommunications, Inc. ( iHeartCommunications ), the Company s indirect parent company, iHeartMedia, Inc. ( iHeartMedia ), the parent company of iHeartCommunications, Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (together, the  Sponsor Defendants ), iHeartMedia s private equity sponsors and majority owners, and the members of the Company s board of directors.  The Company also is named as a nominal defendant.  The complaint alleges that the Company has been harmed by the intercompany agreements with iHeartCommunications, the Company s lack of autonomy over its own cash and the actions of the defendants in serving the interests of iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants to the detriment of the Company and its minority stockholders.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties by causing the Company to: (i) continue to loan cash to iHeartCommunications under the intercompany note at below-market rates; (ii) abandon its growth and acquisition strategies in favor of transactions that would provide cash to iHeartMedia and iHeartCommunications; (iii) issue new debt in the CCIBV note offering (the  CCIBV Note Offering ) to provide cash to iHeartMedia and iHeartCommunications through a dividend; and (iv) effect the sales of certain outdoor markets in the U.S. (the  Outdoor Asset Sales ) to provide cash to iHeartMedia and iHeartCommunications through a dividend.  The complaint also alleges that iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants aided and abetted the directors  breaches of their fiduciary duties.  The complaint further alleges that iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants were unjustly enriched as a result of these transactions and that these transactions constituted a waste of corporate assets for which the defendants are liable to the Company.  The plaintiff is seeking, among other things, a ruling that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and that iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants aided and abetted the board of directors  breaches of fiduciary duty, rescission of payments to iHeartCommunications and its affiliates pursuant to dividends declared in connection with the CCIBV Note Offering and Outdoor Asset Sales, and an order requiring iHeartMedia, iHeartCommunications and the Sponsor Defendants to disgorge all profits they have received as a result of the alleged fiduciary misconduct.   
    
  On May 26, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking expedited discovery and an expedited trial on certain counts of its complaint.  On June 27, 2016, the court denied the motion for an expedited trial and discovery, and on July 12, 2016, the parties stipulated to a schedule that would allow for a decision on the defendants  forthcoming motion to dismiss by mid-September and a trial, if necessary, beginning February 27, 2017.  On July 20, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's verified stockholder derivative complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A hearing was held on defendants' motion to dismiss on September 12, 2016. The court has not yet ruled on the motion.
