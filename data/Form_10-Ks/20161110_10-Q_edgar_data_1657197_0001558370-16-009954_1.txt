Note 1. Description of Business 

Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries,  we,   our,   Cotiviti  or the  Company ) is a leading provider of analytics driven payment accuracy solutions, focused primarily on the healthcare sector. Our integrated solutions help clients enhance payment accuracy in an increasingly complex healthcare environment. We leverage our robust technology platform, configurable analytics, proprietary information assets and expertise in healthcare reimbursement to help our clients enhance their claims payment accuracy. We help our healthcare clients identify and correct payment inaccuracies. We work with over 40 healthcare organizations, including eight of the ten largest U.S. commercial, Medicaid and Medicare managed health plans, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). We are also a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions to over 35 retail clients, including eight of the ten largest retailers in the United States. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

Our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared by us following the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In our opinion they reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items, that are necessary to present fairly the results of interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations; however, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Operating results for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or the entire fiscal year. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Revenue Recognition, Unbilled Receivables and Estimated Liability for Refunds and Appeals 

We provide services under contracts that contain various fee structures, including performance fee based contracts and fixed fee arrangements. Revenue is recognized when a contract exists, services have been provided to the client, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 

We recognize revenue on performance fee-based contracts based upon the specific terms of the underlying contract. The contract terms generally specify: (a) time periods covered by the work to be performed; (b) nature and extent of services we are to provide; (c) the client s duties in assisting and cooperating with us; and (d) fees payable to us. Our fees are most often expressed as a percentage of our findings. Generally, our services are rendered when our clients realize the economic benefits from our services. Our clients realize economic benefits when they take credits against their existing accounts payable based on when we identify cost savings, when they receive refund checks based on overpayments, or when they acknowledge payment reductions based on cost savings. 

We derive a relatively small portion of revenue on contracts with fixed fee arrangements. We recognize revenue on these contracts ratably over the contract term and once all of the above criteria have been satisfied. 

Historically, there has been a certain amount of revenue with respect to which, even though we had met the requirements of our revenue recognition policy, the claim is ultimately rejected. In such cases, our clients may request a refund or offset if their providers or vendors ultimately reject the payment inaccuracies we find or if our clients determine not to pursue reimbursement from their providers or vendors even though we may have collected fees. We record any such refund as a reduction of revenue. We record an estimate for refund liabilities at any given time based on actual historical refund data by client type. We satisfy such refund liabilities either by offsets to accounts receivable or by cash payments to clients.

In addition to the refund liabilities, we calculate client specific reserves when we determine an additional reserve may be necessary. 

The estimated liability for refunds and appeals representing our estimate of claims that may be overturned related to revenue which had already been received was $70,596 and $67,775 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The estimated allowance for refunds and appeals representing our estimate of claims that may be overturned related to amounts in accounts receivable was $31,887 and $33,406 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Under the Medicare Recovery Audit Program, in which we are one of the four Recovery Audit Contractors ( Medicare RAC ) for CMS, healthcare providers have the right to appeal a claim and may pursue additional appeals if the initial appeal is found in favor of CMS. We accrue an estimated liability for appeals based on the amount of fees that are subject to appeals, closures or other adjustments and those which we estimate are probable of being returned to CMS following a successful appeal by the providers. Our estimates are based on our historical experience with the Medicare RAC appeal process. 

This estimated liability for Medicare RAC appeals is an offset to revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The liability is included in the estimated liability for refunds and appeals on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6 for further information regarding the estimated liability for appeals related to the Medicare RAC program. 

Unbilled receivables represent revenue recognized related to claims for which clients have received economic value that were not invoiced at the balance sheet date. Unbilled receivables were approximately $51,762 and $51,799 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively and are included in accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Certain unbilled receivables arise when a portion of our earned fee is deferred at the time of the initial invoice. At a later date (which can be up to a year after original invoice, and at other times during the year after completion of the audit period based on contractual terms or as agreed with our client), we invoice the unbilled receivable amount. Notwithstanding the deferred due date, our clients acknowledge we have earned this unbilled receivable at the time of the original invoice, but we have agreed to defer billing the client for the related services. Unbilled receivables of this nature were approximately $5,828 and $6,431 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

We record periodic changes in unbilled receivables and refund liabilities as adjustments to revenue. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ) which addresses eight specific cash flow issues in order to reduce diversity in practice. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating this guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share based compensation. ASU 2016-09 changes several aspects of the accounting for share based payment award transactions, including 1) accounting for income taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and 5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. We early adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the third quarter of 2016, which did not result in any significant changes to our current or prior period consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with adopting ASU 2016-09, we made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ) which changes the accounting recognition, measurement and disclosure for leases in order to increase transparency. ASU 2016-02 requires lease assets and liabilities to be recognized on the balance sheet and key information about leasing arrangements to be disclosed. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating this new guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ) which changes the current financial instruments model primarily impacting the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are evaluating this new guidance and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , ( ASU 2015 17 ) which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating this new guidance and its impact on our consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures and expect the adoption of this ASU will reduce our total current assets and net working capital. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ) which established guidance regarding the accounting for software licenses. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. We prospectively adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-05 as of January 1, 2016 and have not yet had any material contracts that were impacted by this new guidance. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt and Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015 03 ) which establishes guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that liability, consistent with debt discounts.   Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as an asset in the balance sheet.   The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within that reporting period.   We adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016 and prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. As of December 31, 2015, $20,975 of debt issuance costs were reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet from debt issuance costs, net to long-term debt. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014 09 ) which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and provides clarification of principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. We are evaluating this new guidance, the method of adoption we will take and the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Note 3. Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment by major asset class for the periods presented consisted of the following: 

In December 2015, we purchased a perpetual software license, which is included in the software total above. We will pay for this software over a two year period. As such there is approximately $3,318 included in accounts payable and accrued other expenses and $3,193 included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016. The amount included in other long-term liabilities represents the present value of payments that will ultimately be made. 

Total depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment, including capitalized software costs, was   $5,218   and   $3,773   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and   $14,864   and   $9,270   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 4. Intangible Assets 

Intangible asset balances by major asset class for the periods presented were as follows: 

Amortization expense was   $15,203   and   $15,437   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and   $45,618   and   $46,256   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As a result of our rebranding in September 2015, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $27,826 related to our legacy trademarks during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The remaining trademark value as of September 30, 2016 of $4,200 is related to our retail business that we continue to operate as Connolly, a division of Cotiviti.

Note 5. Goodwill 

Total goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $1,196,350 and $1,197,044 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by our Healthcare and Global Retail and Other segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

There was no impairment related to goodwill for any period presented. 

Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies 

We may be involved in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While any legal proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty, management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  

Medicare RAC Contract Contingency 

In August 2014, CMS announced it would allow providers to remove all eligible claims currently pending in the appeals process by offering to pay hospitals 68% of the original claim amount. This settlement was offered to the providers and it was unknown what, if any, impact there would be for the Medicare RACs. On July 1, 2015, CMS issued a Technical Direction Letter to the Medicare RACs, including ourselves, indicating that Medicare RACs will only be entitled to the contract contingency fee on the settled amounts of the claims, or 32% of the original inpatient claim amounts. Based on the initial lists of finalized settlements provided by CMS, we would be required to refund CMS approximately $22,308 due to the related adjustments in Medicare RAC contingency fees. CMS further advised that as the hospital settlement project continues, additional settlement lists will be matched to Medicare RAC claims which may result in updated refund amounts to those initially provided. While there are uncertainties in any dispute resolution and results are uncertain, we have disputed CMS s findings based on our interpretation of the terms of the Medicare RAC contract and our belief that the backup data provided by CMS is inaccurate and/or incomplete. Our liability for estimated refunds and appeals includes amounts for these settled claims based on our best estimates of the amount we believe will be ultimately payable to CMS based on our interpretation of the terms of the Medicare RAC contract. We believe that it is possible that we could be required to pay an additional amount up to approximately $11,800 in excess of the amount we accrued as of September 30, 2016 based on the claims data we have received from CMS to date. As CMS completes its settlement process with the providers and updated files are provided to us, the potential amount owed by us may change. On September 28, 2016, CMS announced a second settlement process to allow eligible providers to settle their inpatient claims currently under appeal beginning December 1, 2016. This second settlement process could result in additional amounts owed to CMS. The amount of any such additional claims cannot presently be determined.

Note 7. Long term Debt 

In September 2016, in order to benefit from favorable market conditions, we entered into and executed the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement (the  Restated Credit Agreement ), which replaced our then outstanding first and second lien credit facilities, lowered total debt outstanding by $22,700 and provides for lower applicable interest rates. The Restated Credit Agreement consists of (a) a Term Loan A in the amount of $250,000 (the  Term Loan A ), (b) a Term Loan B in the amount of $550,000 (the  Term Loan B ) and (c) a revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) in the amount of up to $100,000. As a result of this refinancing, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9,349 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

In June 2016, we repaid $223,000 in outstanding principal under our then outstanding second lien credit facility (the  May 2014 Second Lien ) using proceeds from our Initial Public Offering ( IPO ). We also made a voluntary prepayment of $13,100 of outstanding principal under the May 2014 Second Lien. As a result of these repayments, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $7,068 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

In May 2015, in order to benefit from favorable market conditions, we entered into and executed the First and Second Amendments to the then outstanding first lien credit facilities (the  May 2014 First Lien ), which, among other things, provide for lower applicable interest rates associated with the May 2014 First Lien by 50 basis points. As a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4,084 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Long term debt for the periods presented was as follows: 

(a) 

The Term Loan A matures on September 28, 2021 and requires quarterly principal payments of $3,125 for the fourth quarter of 2016, $3,125 per quarter in 2017 and 2018, $4,688 per quarter in 2019, $6,250 per quarter in 2020 and $9,375 per quarter for the first two quarters of 2021. The remainder of the outstanding Term Loan A borrowings are due on September 28, 2021. Any mandatory or voluntary prepayment will be applied against the remaining scheduled installments of principal payments in direct order of maturity, unless other direction of application is provided by us. Based on our periodic election, borrowings under the Term Loan A bear interest at either (a) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) plus, based on our Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement), 1.25% - 2.00% for ABR loans or (b) the LIBO Rate ( LIBOR ) plus, based on our Secured Leverage Ratio, 2.25% to 3.00% for LIBOR loans. The ABR is equal to the highest of (i) the New York Federal Reserve Bank rate in effect on such date plus 0.50%, (ii) the LIBOR plus 1.00% and (iii) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent as in effect on the relevant day. The interest period applicable to any LIBOR borrowing is one, two, three or six months, at the election of the borrower. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable the last day of the applicable interest period and, in the case of an interest period of more than three months  duration, each day on which interest would have been payable had successive interest periods of three months s duration been applicable to such borrowing. The interest rate in effect was 3.6% at September 28, 2016.

(b) 

The Term Loan B matures September 28, 2023 and requires quarterly principal payments of $1,375 with all remaining borrowings due on September 28, 2023. Based on our periodic election, borrowings under the Term Loan B bear interest at either (a) the ABR plus 1.75% for ABR loans or (b) the LIBOR plus 2.75% for LIBOR loans. The ABR is equal to the highest of (i) the New York Federal Reserve Bank rate in effect on such date plus 0.50%, (ii) LIBOR plus 1.00%, (iii) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent as in effect on the relevant day and (iv) 1.75%. LIBOR is equal to the higher of (a) the published LIBOR or (b) 0.75%. If our corporate credit rating from Moody s Investor Service, Inc. is Ba3 or better and our corporate family rating from Standard   Poor s Financial Services, LLC is BB- or better, the margin will be reduced by 0.25% per annum for as long as such ratings are maintained. The interest period applicable to any LIBOR borrowing is one, two, three or six months, at the election of the borrower. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable the last day of the applicable interest period and, in the case of an interest period of more than three months  duration, each day on which interest would have been payable had successive interest periods of three months s duration been applicable to such borrowing.The interest rate in effect was 3.6% at September 28, 2016.      

(c) 

The Revolver expires September 28, 2021. Interest for any borrowings under the Revolver is payable over one, two, three or six months at our election. A commitment fee is payable quarterly based on the unused portion of the Revolver commitment which ranges from 0.30% to 0.50% per annum based on certain financial tests. Based on our periodic election, borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at either (a) ABR plus, based on our Secured Leverage Ratio, 1.25% - 2.00% for ABR loans or (b) LIBOR plus, based on our Secured Leverage Ratio, 2.25% to 3.00% for LIBOR loans. The ABR is equal to the highest of (i) the New York Federal Reserve Bank rate in effect on such date plus 0.50%, (ii) the LIBOR plus 1.00% and (iii) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent as in effect on the relevant day. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver as of September 30, 2016. The interest rate in effect was 3.6% at September 28, 2016.     

The Restated Credit Agreement includes certain binding affirmative and negative covenants, including delivery of financial statements and other reports, maintenance of existence and transactions with affiliates. The negative covenants restrict our ability, among other things, to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets or enter into a merger, pay dividends or repurchase stock. Beginning December 31, 2016, there is a required financial covenant applicable only to the Revolver and the Term Loan A, pursuant to which we agree not to permit our Secured Leverage Ratio to exceed 5.50:1.00 through September 2018, 5.25:1.00 through September 2019 and 5.00:1.00 through June 2021. In addition, the Restated Credit Agreement includes certain events of default including payment defaults, failure to perform affirmative covenants, failure to refrain from actions or omissions prohibited by negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults and a change of control default. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2016 and similar affirmative and negative covenants applicable to our then outstanding credit facilities as of December 31, 2015. 

The Restated Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments based upon annual excess cash flows commencing with the year ended December 31, 2017. The mandatory prepayment is contingently payable based on an annual excess cash flow calculation as defined within the Restated Credit Agreement.   

As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate maturities of long term debt for each of the next five years are expected to be $4,500 for the remainder of 2016, $18,000 in 2017 and 2018, $24,250 in 2019 and $30,500 in 2020.  

Note 8. Derivative Instruments 

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term debt. We manage our exposure to fluctuations in the 3 month LIBOR through the use of interest rate cap agreements designated as cash flow hedges. We are meeting our objective by hedging the risk of changes in cash flows related to changes in LIBOR by capping the interest on our floating rate debt linked to LIBOR to approximately 3%. We do not utilize derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $630,000 in notional debt outstanding related to these interest rate caps, which cover quarterly interest payments through September 2019. The notional amount decreases over time.

All of our outstanding interest rate cap contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . Cash flow hedge accounting treatment allows for gains and losses on the effective portion of qualifying hedges to be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until the underlying transaction occurs, rather than recognizing the gains and losses on these instruments in earnings during each period they are outstanding. When the actual interest payments are made on our variable rate debt and the related derivate contract settles, any effective portion of realized interest rate hedging derivative gains and losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is recognized in interest expense. We recognized interest expense of $56 and $23 related to interest rate caps during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $200 and $55 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Ineffectiveness results, in certain circumstances, when the change in total fair value of the derivative instrument differs from the change in the fair value of our expected future cash outlays for the related interest payment and is recognized immediately in interest expense. There was no ineffectiveness recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Likewise, if the hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting, the periodic changes in its fair value are recognized in the period of the change in interest expense. All cash flows related to our interest rate cap agreements are classified as operating cash flows. 

Any outstanding derivative instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements, but we do not expect that the counterparty will fail to meet their obligations. The amount of such credit exposure is generally the positive fair value of our outstanding contracts. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties based on credit assessments, limit our overall exposure to any single counterparty and monitor the market position of any counterparty. 

The table below reflects quantitative information related to the fair value of our derivative instruments and where these amounts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of the period presented: 

We record deferred hedge premiums which are being paid over the life of the hedge in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until the related hedge ultimately settles and interest payments are made on the underlying debt. As of September 30, 2016, we have made payments of $2,204 related to these deferred premiums. We expect to pay an additional $4,190 in deferred premiums through 2019 related to our outstanding interest rate cap agreements which is reflected in the fair value of these derivatives in the table above.  

Comprehensive income includes changes in the fair value of our interest rate cap agreements which qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented related to derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges were as follows:

Note 9. Fair Value Measurements 

We measure assets and liabilities at fair value based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. Authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value whereby inputs are assigned a hierarchical level. The hierarchical levels are: 

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. 

Level 2: Observable prices, other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. 

The following table summarizes our financial instruments measured at fair value within the Consolidated Balance Sheets:  

Investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2015, our investments consisted of money market securities valued using quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets. As of September 30, 2016, we no longer hold any available-for-sale securities. 

The fair value of our private debt is determined based on fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in market yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, general economic conditions and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The carrying value of our debt approximates its fair value. 

The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected variable cash receipts that would occur if interest rates rose above the strike rate of the caps. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including period to maturity and remaining deferred premium payments, and uses observable market based inputs, including interest rates and implied volatilities. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable

market interest rates. As such, the estimated fair values of these liabilities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Note 10. Income Taxes 

The following table presents our income tax provision and effective income tax rate:  

Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 13.4% and 38.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $1,300 tax benefit primarily related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position recorded in a prior period. The impact of this tax benefit relative to the pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in the decrease to the effective tax rate.  

Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 35.2% and 48.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a $1,300 tax benefit related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position recorded in a prior period.   

We are currently under audit with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year ended December 31, 2014. In addition we are currently under audit for iHealth Technologies, Inc. for the tax years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013 and May 13, 2014. As a result, it is reasonably possible that the audits will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At that time, we will record any   adjustment to income tax expense as required. 

Note 11. Stockholders  Equity 

Issuance of Common Stock 

On May 13, 2016 our Certificate of Incorporation was amended and the number of shares of common stock authorized to be issued by the Company was increased from 122,000,000 to 600,000,000. 

On May 25, 2016 we consummated our IPO in which we issued and sold a total of 12,936,038 shares of common stock, including a portion of the underwriter overallotment, at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $226,963 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $18,822. 

A summary of the current rights and preferences of holders of our common stock are as follows: 

Voting 

Common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share of common stock held on all matters on which such common stockholder is entitled to vote. 

Dividends 

Common stockholders are eligible to receive dividends on common stock held when funds are available and as approved by the Board of Directors. The Restated Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends.

Liquidation Rights 

In the event of liquidation or dissolution, common stockholders are entitled to receive all assets available for distribution to stockholders. 

Registration Rights 

The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement contains (i) demand registration rights for Advent, subject to a cap of two requests in any 12 month period; (ii) piggy-back registration rights for any stockholder holding at least $500,000 worth of shares (each, a  Holder ), subject to a pro rata reduction if the total amount of shares requested to be included exceeds the amount of securities which in the opinion of the underwriters can be sold; and (iii) shelf registration rights for Holders, subject to a required anticipated aggregate offering price, net of selling expenses, of $5.0 million, subject to a cap of two requests for shelf registrations, for all Holders in the aggregate, in any 12 month period. Holders that are capable of selling all of their registrable securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act in a single transaction without timing or volume limitations will not have piggy-back registration rights. We will be responsible for fees and expenses in connection with the registration rights, other than underwriters  discounts and brokers  commissions, if any, relating to any such registration and offering. 

Common Stock Split   

On May 13, 2016 we effected a 6.1-for-1 stock split of all outstanding shares of our common stock. All share, option and per share information presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented and all share information is rounded up to the nearest whole share after reflecting the stock split.  

Common Stock Dividends 

On May 25, 2016 we paid a special cash dividend of $150,000, or $1.94 per share of common stock outstanding prior to the IPO, to holders of record of our common stock on the dividend record date. In connection with the special cash dividend we lowered the exercise price of then outstanding stock options by $1.94 per share in order to preserve the intrinsic value of the options giving effect to the special cash dividend. 

Note 12. Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. For all periods presented, potentially dilutive outstanding shares consisted solely of our common stock options. Our potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of the options. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. For all periods presented, all outstanding common stock consisted of a single class.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed as follows: 

Employee stock options and restricted stock units ( RSUs ) that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect is anti dilutive for the periods presented were as follows: 

The criteria associated with all of our outstanding performance-based stock options as defined in the terms of the applicable award agreements, were satisfied as of September 30, 2016 and, as a result, 2,746,592 performance-based stock options were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Performance-based stock options of 2,234,217 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as the vesting conditions had not yet been satisfied. 

Note 13. Stock Based Compensation 

Equity Incentive Plans 

In 2012, we adopted an equity incentive plan ( 2012 Plan ) pursuant to which our Board of Directors (or committee as designated by the Board of Directors) may grant options to purchase shares of our stock, restricted stock and certain other equity awards to directors, officers and key employees. We only granted stock options that can be settled in shares of our common stock under the 2012 Plan. The 2012 Plan had a total of 7,243,330 shares authorized for issuance. Upon completion of the IPO in May 2016, issuances under the 2012 Plan were suspended. At that time we adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2016 Plan  and collectively with the 2012 Plan, the  Plans ), pursuant to which our Board of Directors (or a committee or sub-committee designated by the Board of Directors) may grant options to purchase shares of our stock, restricted stock and certain other equity awards to directors, officers and key employees.

(Unaudited) 

The 2016 Plan was established with the authorization for grants of up to 5,490,000 shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.  

No stock options were granted under the 2012 Plan after December 31, 2015. Awards granted under the 2012 Plan will remain outstanding until the earlier of exercise, forfeiture, cancellation or expiration. To the extent outstanding options under the 2012 Plan are forfeited, cancelled or terminated, the common stock subject to such options will be available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, there are no shares available for future issuance under the 2012 Plan as the 776,839 shares that were available were discontinued upon adoption of the 2016 Plan. As of September 30, 2016 the total number of shares available for future issuance under the Plans is 5,248,202. 

Stock Options 

Under the terms of the 2016 Plan, we may issue options to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 100% of the market price on the date of grant. Issuances under the 2012 Plan, prior to its suspension, were under terms similar to issuances under the 2016 Plan. Stock options granted are subject to either time of service (service-based awards) or performance (performance-based awards) criteria. Service-based awards typically vest ratably over a five year service period from the date of grant under the 2012 Plan and typically vest ratably over a four year service period from the date of grant under the 2016 Plan. In the event of a change in control, any outstanding, unvested service-based awards will vest immediately. Performance-based awards vest in accordance with the specific performance criteria espoused in the executed award agreements. The term of any stock option shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. However, an incentive stock option granted to an employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock may not have a term exceeding five years from the date of grant.  

The following is a summary of stock option activity under the Plans: 

The criteria associated with 2,746,592 of our outstanding performance-based stock options as defined in the terms of the award agreements, was satisfied as of September 30, 2016 and therefore these stock options all became vested and exercisable. 

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between our estimated fair value of common stock and the exercise price of outstanding in the money options. The fair value per share of common stock was $33.53 as of

September 30, 2016 based upon the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was insignificant. The total fair value of stock options vested was $19,153 and $1,831 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $22,159 and $2,014 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Restricted Stock Units 

Restricted stock units provide participants the right to receive a payment based on the value of a share of common stock. RSUs may be subject to vesting requirements, restrictions and conditions to payment. Such requirements may be based on the continued service for a specified time period or on the attainment of specified performance goals as specified in the award agreements. RSUs are payable in cash or in shares or a combination of both. Under the terms of the Plans, RSUs have a grant date fair value equal to the closing price of our stock on the grant date. The units typically vest ratably over a four year service period. We began issuing RSUs upon adoption of the 2016 Plan; no RSUs were issued under the 2012 Plan. 

The following is a summary of RSU activity under the 2016 Plan: 

Stock Compensation Expense 

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The expected term of the option represents the period the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method under the provisions of ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation for estimating the expected term of the options. Since our shares were not publicly traded until May 2016 and were rarely traded privately, at the time of each grant, there was insufficient volatility data available. Accordingly, we calculate expected volatility using comparable peer companies with publicly traded shares over a term similar to the expected term of the options issued. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common shares, therefore, the dividend yield percentage is zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of our stock options. 

We used the following weighted average assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted for the periods presented as follows:

Table of Contents  

Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. 

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 

(In thousands, except shares and per share amounts) 

(Unaudited) 

We recorded total stock based compensation expense of $17,042 and $405 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $21,544 and $1,624 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $15,898 related to the vesting of substantially all outstanding performance based stock options. Stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also includes $2,257 related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options as the result of the IPO. We had not previously adjusted stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures as there has been insignificant forfeiture activity to date. Based on the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we will account for forfeitures as they occur. As of September 30, 2016, we had total unrecognized compensation cost related to 1,857,783 unvested service based stock options and RSUs under the Plans of $15,081 which we expect to recognize over the next 3.2 years. 

Note 14. Segment Information 

Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing financial performance. We conduct our business through two reportable business segments: Healthcare and Global Retail and Other. 

The Healthcare segment provides claims accuracy solutions to health insurance payers and payer related entities. All of our healthcare service offerings focus on generating economic benefits for our clients by identifying errors, reducing improper payments and improving efficiency of business process related to healthcare industry payment networks. The Global Retail and Other segment primarily provides retrospective claims accuracy solutions to large and mid size retailers. Our services primarily result in cost recoveries based on the audit of our clients  supply chain information as well as improved efficiency and effectiveness of our clients  payment networks. 

We evaluate the performance of each segment based on segment net revenue and segment operating income. Operating income is calculated as net revenue less operating expenses and is not affected by other expense (income) or by income taxes. Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments based on the segments  proportionate share of revenue and expenses directly related to the operation of the segment. We do not allocate interest expense, other non operating (income) expense or the provision for income taxes, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segment s overall operating performance. Our CODM does not receive or utilize asset information to evaluate performance of operating segments. Accordingly, asset related information has not been presented. 

Our operating segment results for the periods presented were as follows:

Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans 

Contributions expensed and included in compensation on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for employee benefit plans are detailed below: 

(a) 

We sponsor defined contribution retirement plans in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which cover substantially all U.S. employees, subject to certain minimum age and service requirements. The plans provide for a contribution based on a percentage of eligible employee contributions.     

(b) 

We had a nonqualified profit sharing incentive compensation plan for certain eligible employees. Contributions were made within 90 days following the last day of the plan to a brokerage account in an amount determined at our discretion for employees who had completed 1,000 hours of service and were employed at the time of the contribution. This plan was discontinued after the 2014 plan year, with the final payout occurring in June     

2016 and therefore we did not have a liability under the plan as of September 30, 2016. Our liability under the plan was $893 at December 31, 2015, which is included in accrued compensation costs in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

(c) 

Eligible employees of our subsidiary located in India are covered by the Provident Fund, contributions which are based on a percentage of eligible employees  salaries, and the Payment of Gratuity Act, which provides for benefits to be paid to eligible employees upon termination of employment (collectively, the  India Plan ). Benefits under the Plan are administered by the Indian Government. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had an accrued benefit obligation relating to the India Plan of $714 and $535, respectively.

Note 16. Discontinued Operations 

In February 2015, we received payment on a $900 note receivable related to a business that was disposed of in 2012. Since the date of sale, we had elected to fully reserve the note receivable as the collectability was determined to be uncertain. This gain from the collection of the note receivable, net of tax, is reflected as a gain on discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The estimated impact to diluted EPS as a result of this gain on discontinued operations was $0.01 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

ITEM 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes of Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements and the related notes included in our final prospectus (the  Prospectus ), dated May 25, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), which is deemed to be part of the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-211022), as amended, as well as the section of the Prospectus entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  On June 1, 2016, the Company completed the initial public offering (the  IPO ) of shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) of the Company, for cash consideration of $19.00 per share ($17.77 per share net of underwriting discounts).     On June 29, 2016 the Company completed the sale of additional shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share to the underwriters of its initial public offering at the public offering price of $19.00 per share pursuant to the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the Company s initial public offering. 

As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms  Company,   Cotiviti,   we,   our  and  us  refer to Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. 

This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements regarding the industry outlook, our expectations for the performance of our business, our liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors.  Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of analytics-driven payment accuracy solutions, focused primarily on the healthcare sector. Our integrated solutions help clients enhance payment accuracy in an increasingly complex healthcare environment. We leverage our robust technology platform, configurable analytics, proprietary information assets and expertise in healthcare reimbursement to help our clients enhance their claims payment accuracy. We help our healthcare clients identify and correct payment inaccuracies, which resulted in over $2.7 billion in savings in 2015. We work with over 40 healthcare organizations, including eight of the ten largest U.S. commercial, Medicare and Medicaid managed health plans, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). We are also a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions to over 35 retail clients, including eight of the ten largest retailers in the United States. 

We have multiple strategies for achieving our continued growth. There are significant opportunities to grow our business within our existing client base by increasing the volume of claims we review with our solutions, expanding the utilization of our solutions within these claims and cross-selling our prospective and retrospective solutions. As a result of the merger of Connolly Superholdings, Inc. ( Connolly ) and iHealth Technologies, Inc. ( iHealth Technologies ) in May 2014 (the  Connolly iHealth Merger ), we have cross-sell opportunities across more than half of our healthcare client base. We have a long history of innovation in improving our existing solutions, developing new solutions and expanding the scope of our services. We intend to expand our client base by targeting healthcare payers who utilize competing third party or internal payment accuracy solutions. Additionally, we plan to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic partnerships in payment accuracy and adjacent markets. 

As a result of the meaningful savings we deliver to our clients, we have increased our client base and strengthened our long-standing relationships with many of the leading healthcare payers in the United States. The average length of our relationships with our ten largest healthcare clients is approximately 11 years and, since January 1, 2013, we have successfully retained all of our healthcare clients except one, who represented less than 2% of our revenue. We have also substantially increased the annual savings captured by our healthcare clients over time. As a result, we believe our revenue is highly recurring and we have strong visibility into our revenue.

We are also a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions to the retail market. Retailers process and validate extremely high volumes of transactions with disparate suppliers on varying terms. We work with retail clients in the United States ( U.S. ), Canada and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) to realize their negotiated allowances, concessions, rebates and other incentives associated with merchandise procurement, logistics and other service transactions. In 2015, we generated over $500 million in savings for our retail clients. 

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

Recent Developments   2016 Highlights 

In October 2016, CMS announced that we were awarded two Medicare Recovery Audit Contracts ( Medicare RAC ) to provide retrospective payment accuracy services for Medicare Parts A and B (other than durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies claims). Pursuant to these awards we will be the Recovery Audit Contractor for Region 2 (Central US) and Region 3 (Southeast US). The announcement represents the conclusion of CMS s Medicare RAC reprocurement process. The date on which our auditing work will commence has not yet been determined.     

In September 2016, we refinanced our then outstanding credit facilities and entered into the Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below). This refinancing lowered our current interest rate by approximately 83 basis points. As a result of the refinancing, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $9.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.     

In September 2016, the vesting criteria associated with outstanding performance-based stock options were satisfied, which resulted in approximately $15.9 million in stock-based compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.      

In June 2016, we repaid $223.0 million in outstanding principal under our then outstanding second lien credit facility using the net proceeds from our IPO. We also made a voluntary prepayment of $13.1 million of outstanding principal under the second lien credit facility. As a result of these payments, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     

In May 2016, we launched our IPO, issuing 12,500,000 shares at $19.00 per share. In June 2016, the IPO underwriters partially exercised their option to purchase additional shares from us and we issued an additional 436,038 shares at the IPO price. We received net proceeds from the IPO after the underwriters  discount and other offering expenses of approximately $227.0 million.     

We continued to execute on our strategy, increasing volume and expanding the adoption of our solutions within our existing healthcare clients which contributed to healthcare revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter 2016 and 20% year-to-date 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.     

Growth in our healthcare business has also benefitted from the addition of new clients and our successful cross-sell efforts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated $13.1 million in revenue from five new clients added within the past year and from an additional four existing clients who have adopted either prospective or retrospective solutions.     

During the second quarter 2016, we generated approximately $5.0 million in healthcare revenue from special projects that are not expected to reoccur in the second half of the year.     

The strengthening U.S. dollar has resulted in a negative impact on growth in our retail segment due to our foreign operations in the United Kingdom and Canada.

Dollar Amount of Claims Reviewed 

Revenue in our Healthcare segment in a given period is impacted by the dollar amount of claims we review for our clients, which impacts inaccurate payments that we identify for our clients and the amount of revenue we receive under our performance fee-based contracts. The dollar amount of claims that we review is driven by the scope of claims submitted to us by our clients. The dollar amount of inaccurate payments we identify is also dependent upon the type and number of our solutions used by our clients. As a result of our long-standing relationships with our clients, we have a highly recurring revenue base. 

In our Global Retail and Other segment, our revenue is dependent on (i) the amount of payments that we review for our retail clients and (ii) the timing of our payment reviews, which typically are completed on a batch processing basis following the lapse of a period of time after payment.  

Healthcare Industry and General Economic Conditions 

A majority of our business is directly related to the healthcare industry and is affected by healthcare spending and complexity in the healthcare industry, as follows: 

Healthcare Spending by Payers.   Changing demographics, the shift to managed care plans within government healthcare and increased healthcare coverage may lead to an increase in healthcare spending by our payer clients. From 2004 to 2014, healthcare costs in the United States grew at a 4.8% compounded annual growth rate to $3.0 trillion and are projected to total $3.2 trillion in 2015. According to CMS, healthcare costs are expected to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 5.9% through 2024. Our revenue is impacted by the expansion or contraction of healthcare coverage and spending, which directly affects the number of payments available for our review.     

Complexity in the Healthcare Industry.   We believe reimbursement models may become more complex as healthcare payers accommodate new markets and lines of business and as advancements in medical care increase the number of testing and treatment options available. The adoption of the ICD-10 coding framework in October 2015 has resulted in a nearly five times increase of possible diagnosis codes to approximately 68,000, further complicating the claims process. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the  Affordable Care Act ) has increased the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage. As reimbursement models grow more complex and healthcare coverage increases, the complexity and number of claims may also increase, which could impact the demand for our payment accuracy solutions. Also, many of the changes promulgated by the Affordable Care Act require implementing regulations that have not yet been drafted or have been released only as proposed rules. Such changes could have a further impact on our results of operations.     

In addition, our Global Retail and Other segment is impacted by general economic conditions. For example, in a difficult economy, consumers may be willing to spend less and retailers may reduce their purchasing accordingly, thereby reducing their overall payments available for review. Alternatively, in an expanding economy, retailers may increase their purchasing to meet expected increasing demand resulting in increased payments subject to review using our solutions. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Net revenue 

Our net revenue is generated from contracts with our clients. Our client contracts generally provide for performance fees that are based on a percentage of the inaccurate payments that we prevent through our prospective claims accuracy solutions or the payment recoveries received by our clients that use our retrospective claims accuracy solutions. We derive less than 5% of our revenue on a  fee-for-service  basis whereby billing is based upon a flat fee or a fee per hour. Our clients may request a refund or offset if their providers or vendors ultimately reject the payment inaccuracies we find or if our clients determine not to pursue reimbursement from their providers or vendors even though we may have collected fees. We record   

23 

Table of Contents  

an estimate for refund liabilities at any given time based on actual historical refund data by client type. In such cases, we record any such refund as a reduction of revenue.  

Historically, there has been a seasonal pattern to our healthcare revenue with the revenues in the first quarter generally lower than the other quarters and revenues in the fourth quarter generally being higher than the other quarters. Accordingly, the comparison of revenue from quarter to quarter may fluctuate and is dependent on various factors, including, but not limited to, reset of member liability, timing of special projects and timing of inaccurate payments being prevented or recovered as well as the aforementioned seasonal considerations. Consequently, you should not rely on our revenue for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. 

Cost of revenue 

Our cost of revenue is comprised of: 

Compensation  , which includes the total compensation and benefit-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to clients; and     

Other costs of revenue  , which primarily include expenses related to the use of subcontractors, costs associated with the retrieval of medical records and facilities-related costs associated with locations that are used strictly for revenue generating activities. Cost of revenue does not include depreciation and amortization, which is stated separately in our consolidated statement of operations.     

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

Our selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of: 

Compensation  , which includes total compensation and benefit-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities including those involved with developing new service offerings; and     

Other selling, general and administrative expenses  , which include all of our general operating costs. These costs include, but are not limited to, rent and occupancy costs for facilities associated with locations that are used for employees not serving in revenue generating roles, telecommunications costs, information technology infrastructure costs, software licensing costs, advertising and marketing expenses, costs associated with developing new service offerings and expenses related to the use of certain subcontractors and professional services firms. Selling, general and administrative expenses do not include depreciation and amortization, which is stated separately in our consolidated statement of operations.     

We expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses associated with being a public company, including costs associated with our compliance with   the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). 

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment consists of depreciation related to our investments in property and equipment, including claims accuracy solutions software, as well as amortization of capitalized internal-use software and software development costs. 

Amortization of intangible assets 

Amortization of intangible assets includes amortization of customer relationships, acquired software and certain trademarks. 

24 

Table of Contents  

Transaction-related expenses 

Transaction-related expenses consist primarily of professional services and other expenses associated with the preparation for our IPO and certain expenses associated with certain corporate development activity. 

Impairment of intangible assets 

Impairment of intangible assets includes charges resulting from the impairment of certain trademarks as a result of their carrying value exceeding their estimated fair values. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense consists of accrued interest and related payments on our outstanding long-term debt as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs. Additionally, interest expense includes any effective portion of realized interest rate hedging derivative gains and losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income when the actual interest payments are made on our variable rate debt and the related derivate contract settles. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt 

Loss on extinguishment of debt consists of fees paid and write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the 2015 repricing of our long-term debt, the 2016 early repayment of a portion of our long-term debt and the 2016 refinancing of our long-term debt. 

Other non-operating (income) expense 

Other non-operating (income) expense primarily consists of foreign exchange gains and losses. In addition, income received for certain sub-leases, interest income and realized gains and losses, interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in other non-operating (income) expense. 

Income tax expense 

Income tax expense consists of federal, state, local and foreign taxes based on earnings in multiple jurisdictions. Our income tax expense is impacted by the pre-tax earnings in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and any related foreign tax credits or deductions that may be available to us. Our current and future provision for income taxes will vary from statutory rates due to the impact of income tax incentives and holidays, certain non-deductible expenses, valuation allowances in certain countries, withholding taxes and other discrete items. 

Stock-based compensation expense 

We grant stock-based compensation awards to certain employees, officers and non-employee directors as long-term incentive compensation. We recognize the related expense for service-based awards ratably over the applicable vesting period and expense related to performance-based awards upon the satisfaction of the related vesting criteria. Such expense is recognized in either cost of revenue or selling, general and administrative expenses based upon the function of the optionee. The following table shows the allocation of stock-based compensation expense among our expense line items for the periods presented: 

As of September 30, 2016, we had total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested service-based awards of $15.1 million, which we expect to recognize over the next 3.2 years. Stock-based compensation   

25 

Table of Contents  

expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes approximately $15.9 million as a result of the vesting of performance awards, of which approximately $3.9 million is included in cost of revenue above and the remaining $12.0 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses above. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, stock-based compensation expense includes approximately $2.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options as the result of the IPO. 

Foreign currency translation adjustments. 

The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars using applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates effective during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Foreign currency translation adjustments were insignificant for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to downward foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We had downward foreign currency translation adjustments of $0.7 million and $1.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The downward translation adjustments were the result of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Canadian Dollar and British Pound over the corresponding period. 

Change in fair value of derivative instruments, net of related taxes. 

We are a party to interest rate cap agreements that hedge the potential impact fluctuations in interest rates may have on payments we make pursuant to our First Lien Credit Facilities (as defined below). We had a downward net change in fair value of derivative instruments, net of related taxes, of approximately $0.1 million and     $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.6 million and $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The downward changes were the result of fluctuations in three-month London inter-bank offered rate. 

How We Assess Our Performance 

Adjusted EBITDA 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA, a measure that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), is useful to investors as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measurement to compare our operating performance to our peers and competitors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, impairment of intangible assets, interest expense, other non-operating (income) expense such as foreign currency translation, income tax expense (benefit), gain on discontinued operations, transaction-related expenses and other, stock-based compensation and loss on extinguishment of debt. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements included   in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   for additional information regarding these adjustments. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and facilitates     period-to-period comparisons without regard to our financing methods, capital structure or other items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, management believes we are enhancing investors  understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a supplemental measure of financial performance within our industry. In addition, the determination of Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the definition of a similar measure in our First Lien Credit Facilities other than adjustments for severance costs and non-income based taxes permitted by the First Lien Credit Facilities but not considered by management in evaluating our performance using Adjusted EBITDA.  

Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;      

26 

Table of Contents  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;      

Although depreciation is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;      

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of stock-based compensation upon our results of operations;     

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;      

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expense (benefit) or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes; and      

Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.      

In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. 

The following table presents net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods presented: 

(a) 

Represents an impairment during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 as a result of our rebranding and the related impact to our tradenames.     

(b) 

Represents other non operating (income) expense that consists primarily of gains and losses on transactions settled in foreign currencies. Income received for certain sub leases is included herein.     

(c) 

Represents payment on a $900 note receivable ($559 net of taxes) related to a business that was disposed of in 2012. This note receivable had been reported in the loss on discontinued operations in 2012 upon the sale of that business. Since the date of sale, we had elected to fully reserve the note receivable as the collectability was determined to be uncertain.     

(d) 

Represents transaction related expenses that consist primarily of certain expenses associated with the preparation for our IPO and certain corporate development activity.     

(e) 

Represents expense related to stock based compensation awards granted to certain employees, officers and non employee directors as long term incentive compensation. We recognize the related expense for these awards ratably      

27 

Table of Contents  

over the vesting period. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, performance awards vested resulting in stock compensation expense of $15.9 million.     

(f) 

Represents loss on extinguishment of debt that consists primarily of fees paid and write offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount in connection with the repricing of our long term debt in 2015, the early repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in 2016 and the refinancing of our long-term debt in 2016.     

Dollar Amount of Inaccurate Payments Prevented or Recovered 

The majority of our net revenue consists of performance fees earned under our client contracts. Our performance fees generally represent a specified percentage of inaccurate payments that are either prevented prior to payment using our prospective claims accuracy solutions or recovered by our clients after they are identified using our retrospective claims accuracy solutions. For those clients where we identify any payment inaccuracies in advance of payment to the providers, the clients reduce the amount paid to the providers based upon the inaccuracies that we have identified. For those clients where we identify payment inaccuracies using our retrospective claims accuracy solutions after the client has made payment, clients generally recover claims either by taking credits against outstanding payables to healthcare providers or retail vendors, or future purchases from the related retail vendors, or receiving refund checks directly from those healthcare providers or retail vendors. 

The dollar amount of inaccurate payments prevented or recovered in a given period is impacted by the dollar amount of claims or payments reviewed, the scope of claims or payments that we review, the success of our cross-selling efforts, our ability to retain existing clients and obtain new clients and our ability to enhance our existing solutions or create new solutions. 

We believe the dollar amount of inaccurate payments prevented or recovered is useful to measure our overall operating performance and how well we are executing on our client contracts. 

Debt Refinancings, Repayments and Repricing 

In connection with our various debt refinancings, we incurred significant debt issuance costs, primarily associated with the new indebtedness. These debt issuance costs are amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the associated life of the related indebtedness and recorded as interest expense. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $11.3 million as of September 30, 2016.  

In May 2015, we repriced our then outstanding first lien credit facilities which reduced the related interest rates. We incurred $4.1 million in debt extinguishment costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in connection with the repricing primarily related to accelerated recognition of the unamortized portion of debt issuance costs and original issue discount related to indebtedness that was repaid to certain lenders. 

In June 2016, we repaid $223.0 million in outstanding principal under our then outstanding second lien credit facility using proceeds from our IPO. We also made a voluntary prepayment of $13.1 million of outstanding principal under the second lien credit facility. As a result of these repayments, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $7.1 million during the nine months ended September, 30, 2016 primarily related to the accelerated recognition of the unamortized portion of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. 

In September 2016, we completed a refinancing of our then existing first and second lien credit facilities and entered the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement (the  Restated Credit Agreement ), which provides for first lien credit facilities (the  First Lien Credit Facilities  consisting of a (a) Term Loan A in the amount of $250,000, (b) Term Loan B in the amount of $550,000 and (c) revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) in the amount of up to $100,000, reducing our total debt principal outstanding by $22.7 million and reducing the interest rates. As a result of this refinancing, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, p  rimarily related to the payment of certain fees and the accelerated recognition of the unamortized portion of debt issuance costs and original issue discount related to indebtedness that was repaid to certain lenders  .

Our Segments 

We report our results of operations in two segments, (i) Healthcare and (ii) Global Retail and Other. Through our Healthcare segment, we offer prospective and retrospective claims accuracy solutions to healthcare payers in the United States. We also provide analytics-based solutions unrelated to our healthcare payment accuracy solutions, on a limited basis in the United States. Through our Global Retail and Other segment, we provide retrospective claims accuracy solutions to retailers primarily in the United States, Canada and the U.K., as well as solutions that improve efficiency and effectiveness of payment networks for a limited number of clients. 

We evaluate the performance of each segment based on segment net revenue and segment operating income. The cost of revenue for each segment is based on direct expenses associated with revenue generating activities of each segment. We allocate selling, general and administrative expenses to each segment based on the segments  proportionate share of revenue and expenses directly related to the operation of the segment as determined by management. The following table sets forth the net revenue and operating income for our Healthcare and Global Retail and Other segments for the periods presented (in thousands).

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net revenue 

Net revenue was $156.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $136.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $19.3 million was the result of increased Healthcare segment revenue while our Global Retail and Other segment revenue remained flat. See  Segment net revenue and operating income.  

Cost of revenue 

Cost of revenue related to compensation was $58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $46.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $12.1 million was primarily the result of $7.2 million in additional payroll related expenses due to increased headcount and growth of our Healthcare segment. Stock-based compensation also increased by approximately $4.0 million primarily due to the vesting of performance-based stock options during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as well as additional stock option

grants. Employee benefit costs increased approximately $0.9 million due to rising healthcare coverage costs and the increase in number of employees.  

Other costs of revenue were $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $1.1 million was primarily the result of a $2.1 million increase in variable costs to support our growing operations partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the cost to retrieve medical records due to reduced volume. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses related to compensation was $32.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $15.5 million was primarily related to a $12.7 million increase in stock-based compensation due to the vesting of performance-based stock options during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as well as additional stock option grants. Additionally, compensation related expenses increased $2.2 million primarily due to an increase in the number of employees to support our growing operations, including the hiring of certain key positions associated with being a public company. Employee benefit costs increased approximately $0.6 million due to rising healthcare coverage costs and the increase in number of employees. 

Other selling, general and administrative expenses were $14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $16.  4   million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $2.4 million was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in other variable costs including professional and consulting fees as our current need to leverage external resources has been reduced. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in IT infrastructure and telecommunications costs to support our growing operations. 

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment was $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $1.4 million was due to continued investments in capital expenditures over the past year. 

Amortization of intangible assets 

Amortization of intangible assets was $15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $0.2 million was the result of the impairment of our legacy trademarks related to the Cotiviti rebranding in September 2015. 

Transaction-related expenses 

Transaction-related expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were insignificant. Transaction-related expenses were $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with our IPO. 

Impairment of Intangible Assets 

Impairment of intangible assets was $27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to our Connolly and iHealth trademarks as a result of our Cotiviti rebranding in September 2015. We had no impairment of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was $9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In May 2015 we repriced our then outstanding first lien term loan, lowering the interest rate by 50 basis points. In June 2016 we repaid $236.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our then outstanding second lien credit facility. In September 2016, we refinanced our long-term debt, reducing our outstanding   

31 

Table of Contents  

principal by $22.7 million and reducing our interest rates by approximately 83 basis points overall. The decrease in interest expense of $6.6 million was the result of the reduction in principal, which contributed approximately $3.7 million of the interest expense decrease, and the lower interest rates, which contributed the remaining $2.9 million interest expense decrease.  

Loss on extinguishment of debt 

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the payment of fees and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount as a result of the refinancing of our long-term debt. We did not have a loss on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Other non-operating income 

We had other non-operating income of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses related to our operations in India. 

Income tax expense 

We had a total income tax expense of $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a tax benefit of $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was a result of the increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 13.4% compared to 38.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $1.3 million tax benefit primarily related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position recorded in a prior period.  The impact of this tax benefit relative to the pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in the decrease to the effective tax rate. 

Segment net revenue and operating income 

Healthcare segment net revenue was $138.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $119.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $19.4 million was primarily the result of a net increase of $14.6 million due to increased penetration and extended scope of services provided to our existing client base and a $4.8 million increase due to the addition of new clients and the success of our cross-sell efforts. 

Global Retail and Other segment net revenue was $17.8 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue from our retail client base increased approximately $0.4 million primarily related to timing and nature of the claims reviewed which was offset by a decrease of $0.4 million as a result of foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. 

Healthcare segment operating income was $22.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income of $18.2 million was the result of the increase in net revenue noted above. This was partially offset by an increase in compensation expense of $11.1 million related to an increase in the number of employees in our growing Healthcare segment and a $15.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the vesting of performance-based stock options. Our ongoing investment in strategic initiatives contributed an additional $0.7 million in expense primarily related to an increase in IT infrastructure costs. Rent and occupancy related costs increased $0.8 million as a result of additional leased office space needed to support our growing operations. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $1.2 million due to our continued investments in capital expenditures. These increases were offset by an impairment of intangible assets of $26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to our Connolly and iHealth trademarks as a result of our Cotiviti rebranding in September 2015, a $1.0 million decrease in the costs to retrieve medical records due to reduced volume, a $0.5 million decrease in certain variable costs and a $0.3 million decrease in transaction-related expenses primarily related to costs associated with the IPO.

Other selling, general and administrative expenses were $44.  2   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $44.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $0.2 million was primarily due to a decrease of $3.3 million in other variable costs including professional and consulting fees as our current need to leverage external resources has been reduced. This decrease was partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in IT infrastructure and telecommunications costs to support our growing operations.  

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment was $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Impairment of intangible assets was $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to our Connolly and iHealth trademarks as a result of our Cotiviti rebranding in September 2015. We had no impairment of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was $40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $49.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In May 2015 we repriced our then outstanding first lien term loan, lowering the interest rate by 50 basis points. In June 2016, we repaid $236.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our then outstanding second lien credit facility. In September 2016, we refinanced our long-term debt, reducing our outstanding principal by $22.7 million and reducing our interest rates by approximately 83 basis points overall. The decrease in interest expense of $9.6 million was the result of the reduction in principal, which contributed approximately $5.1 million of the interest expense decrease, and the lower interest rates, which contributed the remaining $4.5 million interest expense decrease. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt 

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the payment of fees and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount as a result of the refinancing of our long-term debt in September 2016 and the early payment on our outstanding borrowings under our then outstanding second lien credit facility in June 2016.

Other non-operating income 

We had other non-operating income of $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 35.2% compared to 48.8% for the nine months ended September 20, 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a $1.3 million tax benefit related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position recorded in a prior period. 

Segment net revenue and operating income 

Healthcare segment net revenue was $403.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $336.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our First Lien Credit Facilities. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $43.8 million and availability under the revolving portion of our First Lien Credit Facilities of $99.5 million. Our total indebtedness was $800.0 million as of September 30, 2016.  

Our principal liquidity needs have been, and will continue to be, debt service, capital expenditures, working capital and potential mergers and acquisitions. In addition, on May 26, 2016 we paid a one-time, special cash dividend of $150.0 million in aggregate, to holders of record of our common stock as of May 24, 2016.  

Our capital expenditures support investments in our underlying infrastructure to enhance our solutions and technology for future growth. Our capital expenditures were $22.6 million and $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase is primarily due to expenditures associated with enhancing our IT platform. We do not expect our capital expenditures to continue to increase. However, our strategy includes the expansion of our existing solutions and the development of new solutions, which will require cash expenditures over the next few years and will be funded primarily with cash provided by operating activities. Accordingly, we expect our annual capital expenditures to continue to remain high as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We believe that our cash flow from operations, availability under our First Lien Credit Facilities and available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the foreseeable future. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of equity financings, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash

flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could possibly result in additional expenses or dilution. 

Summary of Cash Flows 

The following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $108.3 million and $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily was due to a $31.3 million increase in net income adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses, a $0.9 million gain on discontinued operations in the prior year and approximately a $45.7 million increase related to the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.  

Net income adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses was approximately $116.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $85.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the growth in our Healthcare operations. 

The effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was a decrease of $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a decrease of $54.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The most significant drivers contributing to this increase relate to the following: 

An $8.3 million reduction in taxes paid in the current year compared to the prior year. Additionally, approximately $10.0 million in tax payments made in prior periods were applied to our tax liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016;     

A payment of $22.3 million to the former stockholders of iHealth Technologies during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which had been recorded as a liability in accounts payable and accrued other expenses;     

Changes in accounts receivable primarily driven by increased revenue and timing of collections. Accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased $3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to an increase of $12.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; and     

Changes in accrued compensation primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees and timing of payments. Accrued compensation decreased $1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a decrease of $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was $21.4 million and $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily was due to an increase in capital

expenditures due to our ongoing investments, particularly as it relates to enhancing our information technology infrastructure and platforms to support our growing operations. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was $192.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to (a) the payment of a special cash dividend of $150.0 million on May 26, 2016; (b) the repayment of $236.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our then outstanding second lien credit facility in June 2016; (c) the net payment of $22.7 million of outstanding indebtedness as a result of the September 2016 refinancing of our long-term debt; and (d) scheduled debt principal payments of $4.1 million partially offset by net cash proceeds from our IPO of $227.0 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Except for operating leases and certain letters of credit entered into in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Contractual Obligations 

In September 2016, we refinanced our long-term debt. As a result, our contractual obligations related to principal payments of debt and interest on long-term debt upon their original scheduled maturity have been modified accordingly.  Refer to Note 7 Long-term Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further details on the modifications. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies and estimates described in the Prospectus. 

Jumpstart Our Business Act of 2012 

We are an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of our fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ) which addresses eight specific cash flow issues in order to reduce diversity in practice. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating this guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share based compensation. ASU 2016-09 changes several aspects of the accounting for share based payment award transactions, including 1) accounting for income taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4) minimum statutory tax withholding

requirements and 5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. We early adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the third quarter of 2016, which did not result in any significant changes to our current or prior period consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with adopting ASU 2016-09 we made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ) which changes the accounting recognition, measurement and disclosure for leases in order to increase transparency. ASU 2016-02 requires lease assets and liabilities to be recognized on the balance sheet and key information about leasing arrangements to be disclosed. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating this new guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ) which changes the current financial instruments model primarily impacting the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are evaluating this new guidance and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , ( ASU 2015 17 ) which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating this new guidance and its impact on our consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures and expect the adoption of this ASU will reduce our total current assets and net working capital. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ) which established guidance regarding the accounting for software licenses. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. We prospectively adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-05 as of January 1, 2016 and have not yet had any material contracts that were impacted by this new guidance. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt and Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015 03 ) which establishes guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that liability, consistent with debt discounts.   Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as an asset in the balance sheet.   The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within that reporting period.   We adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016 and prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation  . As of December 31, 2015, $20,975 of debt issuance costs were reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet from debt issuance costs, net to long-term debt  . The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014 09 ) which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and provides clarification of principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. We are evaluating this new guidance, the method of adoption we will take and the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ITEM 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk compared to the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk described in the Prospectus. 

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our First Lien Credit Facilities, which bear interest at variable rates. As of September 30, 2016, we had $800.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our long-term debt and $630.0 million notional debt outstanding related to interest rate cap agreements. Based on our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2016, and assuming that our mix of debt instruments, interest rate caps and other variables remain the same, the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in variable interest rates would have an annualized pretax impact on our earnings and cash flows of approximately $7.6 million.

ITEM 4.   Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We have not engaged an independent registered accounting firm to perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of any balance sheet date or for any period reported in our financial statements. Our independent public registered accounting firm will first be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the first year we are no longer an  emerging growth company.  In addition, as a newly public company, our management is not presently required to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting until our second annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the Top Borrower would not be in compliance with   Section 6.15(a)   if any Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Dollars were to be translated into Dollars on the basis of the applicable currency exchange rate used in preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to   Section 5.01(a)   or   (b)  , as applicable, for the relevant Test Period, but would be in compliance with   Section 6.15(a)   if such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other than in Dollars were instead translated into Dollars on the basis of the average relevant currency exchange rates over such Test Period (taking into account the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of any Hedge Agreement permitted hereunder in respect of currency exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the Dollar equivalent amount of such Indebtedness), then, solely for purposes of compliance with   Section 6.15(a)  , the Secured Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such Test Period shall be calculated on the basis of such average relevant currency exchange rates. 

(b)                Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify with the Top Borrower s consent to appropriately reflect a change in currency of any country and any relevant market convention or practice relating to such change in currency.

(d)                The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Top Borrower dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP.   

(e)                The increase in any amount secured by any Lien by virtue of the accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or a dividend in the form of additional Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness is otherwise permitted to be incurred), amortization of original issue discount and/or any increase in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of any fluctuation in the exchange rate of any applicable currency will not be deemed to be the granting of a Lien for purposes of   Section 6.02  .

Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from any Borrower (or any other Person on behalf of any Borrower) in respect of any Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of any sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted by the Swingline Lender to the Administrative Agent, and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that have made their payments pursuant to this   Section 2.04(b)   and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;   provided   that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and thereafter to the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower), if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the relevant Borrower for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this   Section 2.04(b)   shall not relieve any Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. 

(c)               If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.04   by the time specified in   Section 2.04(b)  , the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on  

66 

demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this   clause (c)   shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, JPM may, upon ten days  prior written notice to the Top Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Swingline Lender, which resignation shall be effective as of the date referenced in such notice (but in no event less than ten days after the delivery of such written notice).  In the event of any such resignation, the Top Borrower shall be entitled to appoint any Revolving Lender that is willing to accept such appointment as successor Swingline Lender hereunder. Upon the acceptance of any such appointment, the successor Swingline Lender shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swingline Lender, and the retiring Swingline Lender, as applicable, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity hereunder.  In the event that the successor Swingline Lender resigns, the Borrowers shall promptly repay all outstanding Swingline Loans on the effective date of such resignation (which repayment may be effectuated with the proceeds of a Borrowing). 

Section 2.05.            Letters of Credit  .   

(a)               General  .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each Issuing Bank agrees, in each case in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in this   Section 2.05  , (A) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date to the fifth Business Day prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date, upon the request of any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower), to issue Letters of Credit issued on sight basis only for the account of any Borrower and/or any Restricted Subsidiary (  provided   that a Borrower will be the applicant) and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with   Section 2.05(b)  , and (B) to honor drafts under the Letters of Credit, and (ii) the applicable Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in the Letters of Credit issued pursuant to   Section 2.05(d)  .  On and after the Closing Date, each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit issued hereunder on the Closing Date for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Issuing Bank shall have any obligation hereunder to issue, and shall not be required to issue, any Letter of Credit the proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (i) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of any Sanctions or (ii) in any manner that would result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement. 

(b)               Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions  .

To request an amendment, extension or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit, (other than any automatic extension of a Letter of Credit permitted under   Section 2.05(c)  ) the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) shall submit such a request to the applicable Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least three Business Days in  

67 

advance of the requested date of amendment, extension or renewal (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank), identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended or renewed, and specifying the proposed date (which shall be a Business Day) and other details of the amendment, extension or renewal.  If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank in connection with any request for any Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank s standard form.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower) to, or entered into by any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower) with, the applicable Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.  No Letter of Credit, letter of credit application or other document entered into by any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower) with any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit shall contain any representations or warranties, covenants or events of default not set forth in this Agreement (and to the extent inconsistent herewith shall be rendered null and void (or reformed automatically without further action by any Person to conform to the terms of this Agreement), and all representations and warranties, covenants and events of default set forth therein shall contain standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions for materiality or otherwise consistent with those set forth in this Agreement (and, to the extent inconsistent herewith, shall be deemed to automatically incorporate the applicable standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions set forth herein without action by any Person).  No Letter of Credit may be issued, amended, extended or renewed unless (and on the issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of each Letter of Credit the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, or renewal (i) (A) the LC Exposure of an Issuing Bank does not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit of such Issuing Bank and (B) the aggregate LC Exposure does not exceed the aggregate Letter of Credit Sublimit and (ii) (A) the aggregate amount of the Initial Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Initial Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect, (B) the aggregate amount of the Additional Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to any Class of Additional Revolving Credit Commitments does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect and (C) if such Letter of Credit has a term extending beyond the Maturity Date applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, the aggregate amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit expiring after such Maturity Date does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect that are scheduled to remain in effect after such Maturity Date. 

(c)            Expiration Date.   

(i)            No Standby Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier of (A) the date that is one year after the date of the issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit and (B) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date;   provided   that, any Standby Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any number of additional periods of up to one year in duration (which additional periods shall not extend beyond the date referred to in the preceding   clause (B)   unless 100% of the then-available face amount thereof is Cash collateralized or backstopped on or before the date that such Letter of Credit is extended beyond the date referred to in   clause (B)   above pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank). 

(ii)            No Commercial Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier to occur of (A) 180 days after the issuance thereof and (B) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. 

(d)            Participations  .  By the issuance of any Letter of Credit (or an amendment to any Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable  

68 

Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each other Revolving Lender, and each such Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender (other than the applicable Issuing Bank) hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower) on the date due as provided in   paragraph (e)   of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to any Borrower for any reason.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.   

(e)            Reimbursement  .   

(i)            If the applicable Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Commercial Letters of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank) an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m. two Business Days immediately following the date on which the Top Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement under   paragraph (g)   of this Section;   provided   that the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with   Section 2.03   or   2.04   that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the obligation of the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan.  If the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the relevant Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the payment then due from the relevant Borrower, in the same manner as provided in   Section 2.07   with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and   Section 2.07   shall apply,   mutatis mutandis  , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from any Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. 

(ii)            If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.05(e)   by the time specified therein, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such  

69 

Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  A certificate of the applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this   clause (ii)   shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(f)            Obligations Absolute  .  The obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in   paragraph (e)   of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank;   provided   that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to any Borrower to the extent of any direct damages suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 

(g)            Disbursement Procedures  .  The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower by telephone (confirmed by electronic means) upon any LC Disbursement thereunder;   provided   that no failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall relieve any Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 

(h)            Interim Interest  .  If any Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, unless any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower) reimburses such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that any Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of any Borrower) reimburses such LC Disbursement (or the date on which such LC Disbursement is reimbursed with the proceeds of Loans, as applicable), at the rate per annum then applicable to Initial Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans (or, to the extent of the participation in such LC Disbursement by any Revolving Lender of another Class, the rate per annum then applicable to the  

70 

Revolving Loans of such other Class);   provided   that if the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to   paragraph (e)   of this Section, then   Section 2.13(d)   shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to   paragraph (e)   of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment and shall be payable on the date on which the relevant Borrower is required to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement in full (and, thereafter, on demand). 

(i)            Replacement or Resignation of an Issuing Bank or Designation of New Issuing Banks  .   

(i)            Any Issuing Bank may be replaced with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at any time by written agreement among the Top Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement becomes effective, the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to   Section 2.12(b)(ii)  .  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term  Issuing Bank  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  The Top Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the relevant Revolving Lender, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement.  Any Revolving Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this   paragraph (i)   who agrees in writing to such designation shall be deemed to be an  Issuing Bank  (in addition to being a Revolving Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Bank and such Revolving Lender. 

(ii)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Issuing Bank may, upon ten days  prior written notice to the Top Borrower, each other Issuing Bank and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Bank, which resignation shall be effective as of the date referenced in such notice (but in no event less than ten days after the delivery of such written notice); it being understood that in the event of any such resignation, any Letter of Credit then outstanding shall remain outstanding (irrespective of whether any amounts have been drawn at such time).  In the event of any such resignation as an Issuing Bank, the Top Borrower shall be entitled to appoint any Revolving Lender that accepts such appointment in writing as successor Issuing Bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Issuing Bank hereunder, the successor Issuing Bank shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, and the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity hereunder. 

(j)            Cash Collateralization  .   

71 

(i)            If any Event of Default exists and the Loans have been declared due and payable in accordance with   Article 7   hereof, then on the Business Day on which the Top Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Revolving Lenders demanding the deposit of Cash collateral pursuant to this   paragraph (j)  , the Top Borrower shall deposit, in an interest-bearing account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the    LC Collateral Account   ), an amount in Cash equal to 100% of the LC Exposure as of such date (  minus   the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account);   provided   that the obligation to deposit such Cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in   Section 7.01(f)   or   (g)  . 

(ii)            Any such deposit under   clause (i)   above shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this   paragraph (j)  .  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account, and the Top Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a First Priority security interest in the LC Collateral Account.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders) be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations.  If the Top Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto, to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Top Borrower promptly but in no event later than three Business Days after such Event of Default has been cured or waived. 

Section 2.06.            [  Reserved  ].   

Section 2.07.            Funding of Borrowings  .   

(a)               Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder not later than (i) 1:00 p.m., in the case of LIBO Rate Loans, and (ii) 2:00 p.m., in the case of ABR Loans, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Borrowing Request by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lender s respective Applicable Percentage;   provided   that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in   Section 2.04  .  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account designated in the relevant Borrowing Request or as otherwise directed by the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower);   provided   that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of any LC Disbursement as provided in   Section 2.05(e)   shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. 

(b)               Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from any Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of any Borrowing prior to the proposed date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with   paragraph (a)   of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the  

72 

relevant Borrower) a corresponding amount.  In such event, if any Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of any Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans comprising such Borrowing at such time.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing and the obligation of the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) to repay the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this   Section 2.07(b)   shall cease.  If the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, the amount so paid shall constitute a repayment of such Borrowing by such amount.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Borrower or any other Loan Party may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 

Section 2.08.            Type; Interest Elections  .   

(a)               Each Borrowing shall initially be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of any LIBO Rate Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) may elect to convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBO Rate Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders based upon their Applicable Percentages and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued. 

(b)              To make an election pursuant to this Section, the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) shall (i) deliver an Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) or (ii) provide telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a written Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower)) of the applicable election to the Administrative Agent. 

If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Top Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. 

(c)               Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 

(d)              If the relevant Borrower (or the Top Borrower on behalf of the relevant Borrower) fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBO Rate Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, such Borrowing shall be converted at the end of such Interest Period to a LIBO Rate Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if an Event of Default exists and  

73 

the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Top Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default exists (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBO Rate Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBO Rate Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the then-current Interest Period applicable thereto.

(a)            The Top Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender of any Class (other than any Defaulting Lender) a commitment fee, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Commitment Fee Rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class on the average daily amount of the unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class of such Revolving Lender during the period from and including the Closing Date to the date on which such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class terminates.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (commencing December 31, 2016) for the quarterly period then ended, and on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate.  For purposes of calculating the commitment fee only, the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Class of any Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of Revolving Loans of such Class of such Revolving Lender and the LC Exposure of such Revolving Lender attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class, and no portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Class shall be deemed used as a result of outstanding Swingline Loans. 

(b)            The Top Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender of any Class a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans of such Class that are LIBO Rate Loans on the daily face amount of such Lender s LC Exposure attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class (excluding any portion thereof that is attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements), during the period from and including the Closing Date to the earlier of (A) the later of the date on which such Revolving Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class terminates and the date on which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class and (B) the Termination Date, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, a fronting fee, in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to the earlier of (A) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (B) the date on which such Letter of Credit terminates or (C) the Termination Date), computed at a rate equal to the rate agreed by such Issuing Bank and the Top Borrower (but in any event not to exceed 0.125% per annum) of the daily face amount of such Letter of Credit, as well as such Issuing Bank s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Participation fees and fronting fees shall accrue to but excluding the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and be payable in arrears for the quarterly  

82 

period then ended on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (commencing, if applicable, December 31, 2016);   provided   that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate, and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 30 days after receipt of a written demand (accompanied by reasonable back-up documentation) therefor. 

(c)            [Reserved]. 

(d)            The Top Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the annual administration fee described in the Fee Letter.   

(e)            All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to any Issuing Bank).  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances except as otherwise provided in the Fee Letter.  Fees payable hereunder shall accrue through and including the last day of the month immediately preceding the applicable fee payment date. 

(f)            In the event that, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Closing Date, the Top Borrower (A) prepays, repays, refinances, substitutes or replaces any Initial Term B Loan in connection with a Repricing Transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment made pursuant to   Section 2.11(b)(iii)   that constitutes a Repricing Transaction), or (B) effects any amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent under, this Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction, the Top Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Initial Term B Lenders, (I) in the case of clause (A), a premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term B Loans so prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced and (II) in the case of   clause (B)  , a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial B Term Loans that are the subject of such Repricing Transaction outstanding immediately prior to such amendment.  If, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Initial Term B Loans held by any Initial Term B Lender are prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced pursuant to   Section 2.19(b)(iv)   as a result of, or in connection with, such Initial Term B Lender not agreeing or otherwise consenting to any waiver, consent, modification or amendment referred to in   clause (B)   above (or otherwise in connection with a Repricing Transaction), such prepayment, repayment, refinancing, substitution or replacement will be made at 101% of the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced.  All such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of effectiveness of such Repricing Transaction. 

(g)            Unless otherwise indicated herein, all computations of fees shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and shall be payable for the actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of a fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 

Section 2.13.            Interest  .

(b)               The Term Loans and Revolving Loans comprising each LIBO Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing   plus   the Applicable Rate. 

(c)               [Reserved]. 

83 

(d)               Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Term Loan or Revolving Loan, any LC Disbursement or any fee payable by the Top Borrower hereunder is not, in each case, paid or reimbursed when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, the relevant overdue amount shall bear interest, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal or interest of any Term Loan, Revolving Loan or unreimbursed LC Disbursement, 2.00%   plus   the rate otherwise applicable to such Term Loan, Revolving Loan or LC Disbursement as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00%   plus   the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans as provided in   paragraph (a)   of this Section;   provided   that no amount shall accrue pursuant to this   Section 2.13(d)   on any overdue amount, reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement or other amount payable to a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.   

(e)               Accrued interest on each Term Loan, Revolving Loan and Swingline Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Term Loan, Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan and (i) on the Maturity Date applicable to such Loan, (ii) in the case of a Revolving Loan of any Class, upon termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class and (iii) in the case of any Swingline Loan, upon termination of all of the Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable;   provided   that (A) interest accrued pursuant to   paragraph (d)   of this Section shall be payable on demand, (B) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Term Loan, Revolving Loan (other than an ABR Revolving Loan of any Class prior to the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class) or Swingline Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (C) in the event of any conversion of any LIBO Rate Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Term Loan or Revolving Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 

(f)               All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid;   provided   that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. 

Section 2.14.            Alternate Rate of Interest  .  If at least two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBO Rate Borrowing: 

(a)               the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or 

(b)               the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; 

then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Top Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Top Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, which the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion  

84 

of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBO Rate Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. 

Section 2.15.            Increased Costs  .   

(a)            If any Change in Law: 

(i)            imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the LIBO Rate) or Issuing Bank;  

(ii)            subject any Lender or Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on or with respect to its loans, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(iii)           imposes on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBO Rate Loans made by any Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the relevant Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any LIBO Rate Loan or Letter of Credit in an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Bank to be material, then, within 30 days after the Top Borrower s receipt of the certificate contemplated by   paragraph (c)   of this Section, the Top Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered;   provided   that the Top Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto, (y) such Lender invokes   Section 2.20   or (z) in the case of requests for reimbursement under   clause (iii)   above resulting from a market disruption, (A) the relevant circumstances are not generally affecting the banking market or (B) the applicable request has not been made by Lenders constituting Required Lenders. 

(b)            If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law other than due to Taxes (taking into consideration such Lender s or Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then within 30 days of receipt by the Top Borrower of the certificate contemplated by   paragraph (c)   of this Section the Top Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

85 

(c)            Any Lender or Issuing Bank requesting compensation under this   Section 2.15   shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Top Borrower that (i) sets forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or the holding company thereof, as applicable, as specified in   paragraph (a)   or   (b)   of this Section, (ii) sets forth, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (iii) certifies that such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d)            Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation;    provided  ,    however   that the Top Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank notifies the Top Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor;   provided  ,    further  , that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 

Section 2.16.            Break Funding Payments  .  In the event of (a) the conversion or prepayment of any principal of any LIBO Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBO Rate Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (c) the assignment of any LIBO Rate Loan of any Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Top Borrower pursuant to   Section 2.19  , then, in any such event, the Top Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the amount of any actual out-of-pocket loss, expense and/or liability (including any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Loans, but excluding loss of anticipated profit) that such Lender may incur or sustain as a result of such event.  Any Lender requesting compensation under this   Section 2.16   shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Top Borrower that (A) sets forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, the basis therefor and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (B) certifies that such Lender is generally charging the relevant amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Top Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. 

Section 2.17.            Taxes  .   

(a)               Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Requirements of Law.  If any applicable Requirement of Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax and/or Other Tax, the amount payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings have been made (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this   Section 2.17  ) each Lender (or, in the case of any payment made to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law.  If at any time any applicable withholding agent is required by any applicable Requirement of Law to make any deduction or withholding from any amount payable under any Loan Document, the Top Borrower shall  

86 

promptly notify the relevant Lender and the Administrative Agent upon any Responsible Officer becoming aware of the same. 

(b)               In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law. 

(c)               The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 30 days after receipt of the certificate described in the succeeding sentence, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this   Section 2.17  ), other than any penalties determined by a final and   non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (or documented in any settlement agreement) to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and, in each case,   any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not correctly or legally imposed or asserted);   provided   that if the Top Borrower reasonably believes that such Taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Top Borrower to obtain a refund of such Taxes (which shall be repaid to the Top Borrower in accordance with   Section 2.17(g)  ) so long as such efforts would not, in the sole determination of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, result in any additional out-of-pocket costs or expenses not reimbursed by such Loan Party or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable.  In connection with any request for reimbursement under this   Section 2.17(c)  , the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall deliver a certificate to the Top Borrower setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of the amount of the relevant payment or liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 2.17(c)  , no Borrower shall be required to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this   Section 2.17(c)   for any amount to the extent the Administrative Agent or such Lender fails to notify the Top Borrower of such possible indemnification claim within 180 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender receives written notice from the applicable taxing authority of the specific tax assessment giving rise to such indemnification claim. 

(d)               Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment under any Loan Document that is attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that no Loan Party has already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 9.05(c)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Taxes not described in   clauses (i)   or   (ii)   that are attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to any Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this   clause (d)  . 

(e)               As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Top Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 

87 

(f)            Status of Lenders  .   

(i)            Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any withholding Tax with respect to any payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation as the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 

(ii)            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

(A)            each Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two executed original copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 

(B)            each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 

(1)            in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing any available exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax; 

(2)            two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; 

(3)            in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, (x) two executed original copies of a certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit L-1   to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Top Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no payments payable to such Lender are effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (a    U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate   ) and (y) two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or 

(4)            to the extent any Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (e.g., where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender), two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate  

88 

substantially in the form of   Exhibit L-2  ,    Exhibit L-3   or   Exhibit L-4  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if such Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit L-2   on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner; 

(C)            each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two executed original copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law to permit the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

(D)            if a payment made to any Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Top Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation as is prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and may be necessary for the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. 

Each Lender agrees that if any documentation it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such documentation or promptly notify the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this   Section 2.17(f)  . 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this   Section 2.17(f)  , no Lender shall be required to provide any documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 

(g)            If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.17  , it shall pay over such refund to the Top Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the relevant Borrower under this   Section 2.17   with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund), and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);   provided   that the Top Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (  plus   any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent  

89 

or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this   paragraph (g)  , in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Top Borrower pursuant to this   paragraph (g)   to the extent that the payment thereof would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the position that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This   Section 2.17   shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the relevant Loan Party or any other Person. 

(h)            Survival  .  Each party s obligations under this   Section 2.17   shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 

(i)            Definition of  Lender   .  For the avoidance of doubt, the term  Lender  shall, for all purposes of this   Section 2.17  , include any Issuing Bank and any Swingline Lender. 

(j)            Certain Tax Matters  . 

(i)            For the avoidance of doubt, solely for purposes of FATCA, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat), this Agreement and any Loans made thereunder (including any Loans already outstanding) as not qualifying as  grandfathered obligations  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). 

(ii)            The parties shall treat this Agreement as resulting in a significant modification to the Converted Term B Loans (as defined in the Restatement Agreement) within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1001-3 and, in connection therewith (A) all Initial Term B Loans (including the Converted Term B Loans (as defined in the Restatement Agreement)) shall be treated as one fungible tranche for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (B) the issue price (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all Initial Term B Loans shall be determined based on the amount of cash paid for the Initial Term B Loans other than the Converted Term B Loans (in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1273(a)(1)).  

Section 2.18.            Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Payments  .    

(a)            Unless otherwise specified, the relevant Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under   Section 2.15  ,    2.16   or   2.17  , or otherwise) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated by the Administrative Agent to the Top Borrower, except that payments pursuant to   Sections 2.15  ,    2.16  ,    2.17   and   9.03   shall be made directly to the Person or Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  Except as provided in   Sections 2.19(b)   and   2.20  , each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans of a given Class and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type (and of the same Class) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their  

90 

respective Applicable Percentages of the applicable Class.  Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender s portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender s percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount.  All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.  Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.     

(b)            Subject in all respects to the provisions of any Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent while an Event of Default exists and all or any portion of the Loans have been accelerated hereunder pursuant to   Section 7.01  , shall be applied,   first  , to the payment of all costs and expenses then due incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any collection, sale or realization on Collateral or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Loan Party and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document,   second  , on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent (other than those covered in clause first above) or to the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank from the Top Borrower constituting Secured Obligations,   third  , on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts of the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has yet been made) owed to the Secured Parties on the date of any such distribution, to the payment in full of the Secured Obligations (including, with respect to LC Exposure, an amount to be paid to the Administrative Agent equal to 100% of the LC Exposure (  minus   the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account) on such date, to be held in the LC Collateral Account as Cash collateral for such Obligations);   provided   that if any Letter of Credit expires undrawn, then any Cash collateral held to secure the related LC Exposure shall be applied in accordance with this   Section 2.17(b)  , beginning with clause first above,   fourth  , as provided in any Intercreditor Agreement, and   fifth  , to, or at the direction of, the Top Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. 

(c)            If any Lender obtains payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans held by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for Cash at face value) participations in the Loans of such Class and sub-participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans of other Lenders of such Class at such time outstanding to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans;   provided   that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to (x) any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, including any payment made or deemed made in connection with   Sections 2.22  ,    2.23   and   9.02(c)  .  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise  

91 

against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this   Section 2.18(c)   and will, in each case, notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.  Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this   Section 2.18(c)   shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. 

(d)            Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Top Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Top Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Top Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank the amount due.  In such event, if the Top Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 

(e)            If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to   Section 2.07(b)   or   Section 2.18(d)  , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 

Section 2.19.            Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  .   

(a)               If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.15   or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans pursuant to   Section 2.20  , or any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17  , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or its participation in any Letter of Credit affected by such event, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.15   or   2.17  , as applicable, in the future or mitigate the impact of   Section 2.20  , as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed out-of-pocket cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect.  The Top Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 

(b)               If (i) any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.15   or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans pursuant to   Section 2.20  , (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17  , (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of  each Lender ,  each Revolving Lender  or  each Lender directly affected thereby  (or any other Class or group of Lenders other than the Required Lenders) with respect to which Required Lender, Required Revolving Lender, Required Term A Lender or Required Pro Rata Lender consent (or the consent of Lenders holding loans or  

92 

commitments of such Class or lesser group representing more than 50% of the sum of the total loans and unused commitments of such Class or lesser group at such time) has been obtained, as applicable, any Lender is a non-consenting Lender (each such Lender described in this   clause (iv)  , a    Non-Consenting Lender   ), then the Top Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the applicable Commitments of such Lender, and repay all Obligations of the relevant Borrowers owing to such Lender relating to the applicable Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date (  provided   that, if, after giving effect such termination and repayment, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Class exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect, then the Top Borrower shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Revolving Borrowings of the applicable Class or Swingline Loans (and, if no Revolving Borrowings of such Class are outstanding, deposit Cash collateral in the LC Collateral Account) in an amount necessary to eliminate such excess) or (y) replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in   Section 9.05  ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if any Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that (A) such Lender has received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and, if applicable, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, in each case of such Class of Loans and/or Commitments, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it under any Loan Document with respect to such Class of Loans and/or Commitments, (B) in the case of any assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 2.15   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 2.17  , such assignment would result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (C) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law.  No Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) shall be required to make any such assignment and delegation, and the Top Borrower may not repay the Obligations of such Lender or terminate its Commitments, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Top Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this   Section 2.19  , it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Promissory Note (if the assigning Lender s Loans are evidenced by one or more Promissory Notes) subject to such Assignment and Assumption (  provided   that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this   Section 2.19   to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver any such Promissory Note shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid), such assignment shall be recorded in the Register, any such Promissory Note shall be deemed cancelled.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lender s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agent s discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any action and to execute any such Assignment and Assumption or other instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this   clause (b)  .  To the extent that any Initial Term B Lender is replaced pursuant to   Section 2.19(b)(iv)   in connection with a Repricing Transaction requiring payment of a fee pursuant to   Section 2.12(f)  , the Top Borrower shall pay to such Initial Term B Lender the fee described in   Section 2.12(f)  . 

Section 2.20.            Illegality  .  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Published LIBO Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Top Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBO Rate Loans or to convert ABR Loans to LIBO Rate Loans shall be  

93 

suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Published LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Published LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly).  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Top Borrower shall, upon demand from the relevant Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or convert all of such Lender s LIBO Rate Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Published LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate) either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans (in which case the Top Borrower shall not be required to make payments pursuant to   Section 2.16   in connection with such payment) and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Published LIBO Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Top Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the determination of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 

Section 2.21.            Defaulting Lenders  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 

(a)               Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of any Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 2.12(a)   and, subject to   clause (d)(iv)   below, on the participation of such Defaulting Lender in Letters of Credit pursuant to   Section 2.12(b)   and pursuant to any other provisions of this Agreement or other Loan Document. 

(b)              The Commitments and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders, each affected Lender, the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving Lenders, the Required Term A Lenders and/or the Required Pro Rata Lenders or such other number of Lenders as may be required hereby or under any other Loan Document have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any waiver, amendment or modification pursuant to   Section 9.02  );   provided   that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender disproportionately and adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 

(c)               Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to   Section 2.11  ,    Section 2.15  ,    Section 2.16  ,    Section 2.17  ,    Section 2.18  ,    Article 7  ,    Section 9.05   or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 9.09  ), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent and, where relevant, the Top Borrower as follows:    first  , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;   second  , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any applicable Issuing Bank and/or Swingline Lender hereunder;   third  , if so reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or reasonably requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, to be held as Cash collateral for future funding obligations of  

94 

such Defaulting Lender in respect of any participation in any Letter of Credit;   fourth  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, as the Top Borrower may request, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement;   fifth  , as the Administrative Agent or the Top Borrower may elect, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;   sixth  , to the payment of any amounts owing to the non-Defaulting Lenders, Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any non-Defaulting Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   seventh  , to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   eighth  , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided   that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Exposure in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loan or LC Exposure was made or created, as applicable, at a time when the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Exposure owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Exposure owed to, such Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to any Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by any Defaulting Lender or to post Cash collateral pursuant to this   Section 2.21(c)   shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 

(d)            If any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 

(i)            the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages but only to the extent that (A) the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures of all non-Defaulting Lenders attributable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class does not exceed the total of the Revolving Credit Commitments of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders of such Class and (B) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender that is attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class does not exceed such non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class;  

(ii)            if the reallocation described in   clause (i)   above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Top Borrower shall, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Requirements of Law, within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, Cash collateralize 100% of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure and any obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund participations in any Swingline Loan (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to   paragraph (i)   above and any Cash collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender or pursuant to   Section 2.21(c)   above) or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and to the applicable Issuing Bank and/or the Swingline Lender with respect to such LC Exposure and/or Swingline Loans and obligations to fund participations.  Cash collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce LC Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (A) the elimination of the applicable LC Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of the Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with   Section 2.19  )) or (B) the Administrative Agent s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash collateral (including as a result of any subsequent reallocation of Swingline Loans and LC Exposure among non-Defaulting Lenders described in   clause (i)   above); 

95 

(iii)            if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this   Section 2.21(d)  , then the fees payable to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to   Sections 2.12(a)   and   (b)  , as the case may be, shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation; and 

(iv)            if any Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is not Cash collateralized, prepaid or reallocated pursuant to this   Section 2.21(d)  , then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under   Section 2.12(b)   with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is Cash collateralized or reallocated. 

(e)            So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan, and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, create, incur, amend or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders, Cash collateral provided pursuant to   Section 2.21(c)   and/or Cash collateral provided in accordance with   Section 2.21(d)  , and participating interests in any such or newly issued, extended or created Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in a manner consistent with   Section 2.21(d)(i)   (it being understood that Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein). 

(f)            In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower agree that any Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment, and on such date such Revolving Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the applicable Class of the other Revolving Lenders or participations in Revolving Loans of the applicable Class as the Administrative Agent determine as necessary in order for such Revolving Lender to hold such Revolving Loans or participations in accordance with its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class or its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage, as applicable.  Notwithstanding the fact that any Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, (x) no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of any Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender and (y) except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 

Section 2.22.            Incremental Credit Extensions  .   

(a)            Any Borrower may, at any time, on one or more occasions pursuant to an Incremental Facility Amendment (i) add one or more new tranches of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the Term Loans of any existing Class by requesting new commitments to provide such Term Loans (any such new tranche or increase, an    Incremental Term Facility    and any loans made pursuant to an Incremental Term Facility,    Incremental Term Loans   ) and/or (ii) add one or more new tranches of incremental revolving commitments and/or increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any existing Class (any such new tranche or increase, an    Incremental Revolving Facility    and, together with any Incremental Term Facility,    Incremental Facilities    and the loans thereunder,    Incremental Revolving Loans    and any Incremental Revolving Loans, together with any Incremental Term Loans,    Incremental Loans   ) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed the Incremental Cap;   provided   that:

(iii)            no Incremental Facility or Incremental Loan (nor the creation, provision or implementation thereof) shall require the approval of any existing Lender other than in its capacity, if any, as a lender providing all or part of any Incremental Commitment or Incremental Loan, 

(iv)            except as otherwise permitted herein, (A) the terms of any Incremental Term Facility (other than any terms which are applicable only after the Latest Maturity Date applicable to any then-existing Term Loans) must be (1) substantially consistent with those applicable to the Initial Term A Loans in the case of Incremental Term A Loans or Initial Term B Loans in the case of Incremental Term B Loans, or (2) otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (it being understood and agreed that any terms that are more favorable to the Term Lenders than those contained in the then-existing Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Term Lenders pursuant to an amendment to this Agreement effectuated in reliance on   Section 9.02(d)(ii)   are acceptable to the Administrative Agent) and (B) the terms of any Incremental Revolving Facility (other than any terms which are applicable only after the then-existing Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date), must be substantially consistent with those applicable to any then-existing Revolving Facility or otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (it being understood and agreed that any terms that are more favorable to the Revolving Lenders than those contained in the then-existing Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to an amendment to this Agreement effectuated in reliance on   Section 9.02(d)(ii)   are acceptable to the Administrative Agent), 

(v)            the Effective Yield (and the components thereof) applicable to any Incremental Facility may be determined by the relevant Borrower and the lender or lenders providing such Incremental Facility;   provided   that, in the case of any Incremental Term B Facility (other than any Incremental Term B Facility consisting of a Customary Bridge Loan (excluding any Indebtedness into which such Customary Bridge Loans are converted)) that is pari passu with the Initial Term B Loans in right of payment and with respect to security, the Effective Yield applicable thereto may not be more than 0.50% higher than the Effective Yield applicable to the Initial Term B Loans unless the Applicable Rate with respect to the Initial Term B Loans is adjusted to be equal to the Effective Yield with respect to such Incremental Facility,   minus  , 0.50%, 

(vi)            (A) the final maturity date with respect to (1) any Incremental Term A Loans shall be no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date applicable to Term A Loans and/or (2) any Incremental Term B Loans shall be no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date applicable to Term B Loans and (B) no Incremental Revolving Facility may have a final maturity date earlier than (or require scheduled amortization or mandatory commitment reductions prior to) the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date, 

(vii)            (A) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Incremental Term A Facility shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any then-existing tranche of Term A Loans and (B) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any

ARTICLE 8       THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints JPM (or any successor appointed pursuant hereto) as Administrative Agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 

Any Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, unless the context otherwise requires or unless such Person is in fact not a Lender, include each Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party or any subsidiary of any Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them. 

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists, and the use of the term  agent  herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Requirements of Law; it being understood that such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers that are expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents and which the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders, Required Revolving Lenders, Required Term A Lenders or Required Pro Rata Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the relevant circumstances as provided in   Section 9.02  );   provided    that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Requirements of Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Top Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders, Required Revolving Lenders, Required Term A Lenders and/or Required Pro Rata Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as is necessary, or as the Administrative Agent believes in good faith shall be necessary, under the relevant circumstances as provided in   Section 9.02  ) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Top Borrower or any Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any  

149 

Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any covenant, agreement or other term or condition set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien on the Collateral or the existence, value or sufficiency of the Collateral or to assure that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document have been or will continue to be properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in   Article 4   or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vii) any property, book or record of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof. 

Each Lender agrees that, except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, it will not take any enforcement action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, accelerate the Obligations under any Loan Document, or exercise any right that it might otherwise have under applicable Requirements of Law or otherwise to credit bid at any foreclosure sale, UCC sale, any sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar Disposition of Collateral.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may take action to preserve or enforce its rights against a Loan Party where a deadline or limitation period is applicable that would, absent such action, bar enforcement of the Obligations held by such Lender, including the filing of a proof of claim in a case under the Bankruptcy Code. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Guaranty; it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof, and all powers, rights and remedies under the other Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or in the event of any other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply all or any portion of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such Disposition and (B) the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of all or any portion of such Collateral at any such Disposition. 

No holder of any Secured Hedging Obligation or Banking Services Obligation in its respective capacity as such shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under this Agreement. 

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Hedge Agreement with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligation and/or by entering into documentation in connection with any Banking Services Obligation, each of the other Secured Parties hereby authorizes and shall be deemed to authorize) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of all Secured Parties to take any of the following actions upon the instruction of the Required Lenders: 

(a)            consent to the Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral free and clear of the Liens securing the Secured Obligations in connection with any Disposition pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 thereof; 

(b)            credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in  

150 

connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Section 363 thereof; 

(c)            credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the UCC, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the UCC; 

(d)            credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any foreclosure or other Disposition conducted in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law following the occurrence of an Event of Default, including by power of sale, judicial action or otherwise; and/or 

Cotiviti International Holdings, Inc., which the Top Borrower hereby certifies is, as of the Closing Date, an Excluded Subsidiary, is hereby released as a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.22 and the lien, security interest and assignment granted to the Administrative Agent by Cotiviti International Holdings, Inc. under the Security Agreement are hereby terminated, released and discharged effective as of the Closing Date. 

(e)            estimate the amount of any contingent or unliquidated Secured Obligations of such Lender or other Secured Party; 

it being understood that no Lender shall be required to fund any amount in connection with any purchase of all or any portion of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing   clauses (b)  ,    (c)   or   (d)   without its prior written consent. 

Each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to credit bid any part of the Secured Obligations or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral;   provided   that, in connection with any credit bid or purchase described under   clauses (b)  ,    (c)   or   (d)   of the preceding paragraph, the Secured Obligations owed to all of the Secured Parties (other than with respect to contingent or unliquidated liabilities as set forth in the next succeeding paragraph) may be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent on a ratable basis. 

With respect to any contingent or unliquidated claim that is a Secured Obligation, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, but is not required, to estimate the amount thereof for purposes of any credit bid or purchase described in the second preceding paragraph so long as the estimation of the amount or liquidation of such claim would not unduly delay the ability of the Administrative Agent to credit bid the Secured Obligations or purchase the Collateral in the relevant Disposition.  In the event that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to estimate any such contingent or unliquidated claim or any such claim cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Administrative Agent to consummate any credit bid or purchase in accordance with the second preceding paragraph, then any contingent or unliquidated claims not so estimated shall be disregarded, shall not be credit bid, and shall not be entitled to any interest in the portion or the entirety of the Collateral purchased by means of such credit bid. 

Each Secured Party whose Secured Obligations are credit bid under   clauses (b)  ,    (c)   or   (d)   of the third preceding paragraph is entitled to receive interests in the Collateral or any other asset acquired in connection with such credit bid (or in the Capital Stock of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such acquisition) on a ratable basis in accordance with the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the Secured Obligations of such Secured Party that were credit bid in such credit bid or  

151 

other Disposition, by (y) the aggregate amount of all Secured Obligations that were credit bid in such credit bid or other Disposition. 

In addition, in case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement is then due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent has made any demand on the Top Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 

(i)            to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans or LC Disbursements and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts to the extent due to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under   Sections 2.12   and   9.03  ) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 

(ii)            to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same. 

Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent consents to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amount due to the Administrative Agent under   Sections 2.12   and   9.03  . 

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any Issuing Bank in any such proceeding. 

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) that it believes to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent has received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 

152 

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent. 

The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten days  written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Top Borrower.  If the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender, either the Required Lenders or the Top Borrower may, upon ten days  notice, remove the Administrative Agent.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or delivery of any such notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Top Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank or trust company with offices in the U.S. having combined capital and surplus in excess of $1,000,000,000;   provided   that during the existence and continuation of an Event of Default under   Section 7.01(a)   or, with respect to any Borrower,   Sections 7.01(f)   or   (g)  , no consent of the Top Borrower shall be required.  If no successor has been appointed as provided above and accepted such appointment within ten days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or the Administrative Agent receives notice of removal, then (a) in the case of a retirement, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Top Borrower) or (b) in the case of a removal, the Top Borrower may, after consulting with the Required Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above;    provided   that (x) in the case of a retirement, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Top Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment or (y) in the case of a removal, the Top Borrower notifies the Required Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then, in each case, such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as collateral agent for the Secured Parties for purposes of maintaining the perfection of the Lien on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations required to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank will cooperate with the Borrowers to enable the Borrowers to take such actions), until such time as the Required Lenders or the Top Borrower, as applicable, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, as provided above in this   Article 8  .  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder as a successor Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (other than its obligations under   Section 9.13   hereof).  The fees payable by the Borrowers to any successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Top Borrower and such successor Administrative Agent.  After the Administrative Agent s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and   Section 9.03   shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the relevant Person was acting as Administrative Agent (including for this purpose holding any collateral security following the retirement or removal of the Administrative  

153 

Agent).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Disqualified Institution (nor any Affiliate thereof) may be appointed as a successor Administrative Agent. 

Each of each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each of each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their respective Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.

Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty or its Lien on any Collateral pursuant to this   Article 8  .  In each case as specified in this   Article 8  , the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender, and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrowers  expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, to subordinate its interest therein, or to release such Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this   Article 8  ;    provided  , that upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Top Borrower shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying that the relevant transaction has been consummated in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 

The Administrative Agent is authorized to enter into any Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement contemplated hereby with respect to any (a) Indebtedness (i) that is (A) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder and/or (B) secured by Liens and (ii) which contemplates an intercreditor, subordination or collateral trust agreement and/or (b) Secured Hedging Obligations and/or Secured Banking Services Obligations, whether or not constituting Indebtedness (any such other intercreditor agreement an    Additional Agreement   ), and the Secured Parties party hereto acknowledge that any Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Agreement is binding upon them.

(a)    No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any party hereto therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same is permitted by   paragraph (b)   of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

(A)            the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but not the consent of the Required Lenders) shall be required for any waiver, amendment or modification that: 

(1)            increases the Commitment of such Lender (other than with respect to any Incremental Facility pursuant to   Section 2.22   in respect of which such Lender has agreed to be an Additional Lender); it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall constitute an increase of any Commitment of such Lender;

(5)            extends the expiry date of such Lender s Commitment; it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitment shall constitute an extension of any Commitment of any Lender; and 

(6)            waives, amends or modifies the provisions of   Sections 2.18(b)   or   2.18(c)   of this Agreement in a manner that would by its terms alter the  waterfall  provision therein or the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby (except in connection with any transaction permitted under   Sections 2.22  ,    2.23  ,    9.02(c)   and/or   9.05(g)   or as otherwise provided in this   Section 9.02  );

(iii)            if the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower have jointly identified any ambiguity, mistake, defect, inconsistency, obvious error or any error or omission of a technical nature or any necessary or desirable technical change, in each case, in any provision of any Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision solely to address such matter as reasonably determined by them acting jointly,

(vii)            this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit any extension of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the relevant benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Lenders prior to such inclusion.

No Borrower shall, without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee unless (i) such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) such settlement does not include any statement as to any admission of fault or culpability. 

Section 9.04.            Waiver of Claim.    To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, no party to this Agreement shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, any Loan Party and/or any Related Party of any thereof, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, except, in the case of any  

166

(C)            the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually), and shall pay to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent); and 

(D)            the relevant Eligible Assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver on or prior to the effective date of such assignment, to the Administrative Agent (1) an Administrative Questionnaire and (2) any Internal Revenue Service form required under   Section 2.17  .

Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such  

168 

recordation, shall not affect any Borrower s obligations in respect of such Loans and LC Disbursements.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, each Issuing Bank and each Lender (but only as to its own holdings), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 

(v)            Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee, the Eligible Assignee s completed Administrative Questionnaire and any tax certification required by   Section 9.05(b)(ii)(D)(2)   (unless the assignee is already a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in   paragraph (b)   of this Section, if applicable, and any written consent to the relevant assignment required by   paragraph (b)   of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 

(vi)            By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender and the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (A) the assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that the amount of its commitments, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without giving effect to any assignment thereof which has not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption, (B) except as set forth in   clause (A)   above, the assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Top Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Top Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) the assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee, legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (D) the assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement and any Intercreditor Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in   Section 4.01(c)   or the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to   Section 5.01   and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (E) the assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (F) the assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent, by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) the assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

169 

the limitation set forth in the first proviso of the penultimate paragraph set forth in   Section 9.05(g)  , as if the limitation applied to such participations), the Top Borrower or any of its Affiliates) (a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its commitments and the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the relevant Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in (x)   clause (A)   of the first proviso to   Section 9.02(b)   that directly and adversely affects the Loans or commitments in which such Participant has an interest and (y)   clauses (B)(1)  ,    (2)   or   (3)   of the first proviso to   Section 9.02(b)  .  Subject to   paragraph (c)(ii)   of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 2.15  ,    2.16   and   2.17   (subject to the limitations and requirements of such Sections and   Section 2.19  ) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   paragraph (b)   of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under   Section 2.17(f)   shall be delivered to the participating Lender, and if additional amounts are required to be paid pursuant to   Section 2.17(a)   or   Section 2.17(c)  , to the Top Borrower and the Administrative Agent).  To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 9.09   as though it were a Lender;   provided   that such Participant shall be subject to   Section 2.18(c)   as though it were a Lender.   

(ii)            No Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 2.15  ,    2.16   or   2.17   than the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Top Borrower s prior written consent   expressly acknowledging that such Participant s entitlement to benefits under   Sections 2.15  ,    2.16   and   2.17   is not limited to what the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive absent the participation  . 

Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and their respective successors and registered assigns, and the principal and interest amounts of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (a    Participant Register   );   provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of any Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to any Participant s interest in any Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or any other obligation under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 

(d)            (i)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (other than to any Disqualified Institution or any natural person) to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this   Section 9.05   shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;   provided   that no  

170 

such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 

(ii)            No Lender may at any time enter into a total return swap, total rate of return swap, credit default swap or other derivative instrument under which any Secured Obligation is a reference obligation with any counterparty that is a Disqualified Institution. 

(e)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a    Granting Lender   ) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an     SPC   ), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower, the option to provide to any Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement;   provided   that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.

Schedule 1.01(b)   Dutch Auction 

Dutch Auction    means an auction (an    Auction   ) conducted by any Affiliated Lender or any Debt Fund Affiliate (any such Person, the    Auction Party   ) in order to purchase Term Loans, in accordance with the following procedures;   provided     that no Auction Party shall initiate any Auction unless (I) at least five Business Days have passed since the consummation of the most recent purchase of Term Loans pursuant to an Auction conducted hereunder; or (II) at least three Business Days have passed since the date of the last Failed Auction which was withdrawn pursuant to   clause (c)(i)   below: 

(a)            Notice Procedures  .  In connection with any Auction, the Auction Party will provide notification to the Auction Agent (as defined below) (for distribution to the relevant Lenders) of the Term Loans that will be the subject of the Auction (an    Auction Notice   ).  Each Auction Notice shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Auction Agent and shall (i) specify the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans subject to the Auction, in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 and whole increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in any case, such lesser amount of such Term Loans then outstanding or which is otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Auction Agent and the Administrative Agent (if different from the Auction Agent)) (the    Auction Amount   ), (ii) specify the discount to par (which may be a range (the    Discount Range   ) of percentages of the par principal amount of the Term Loans subject to such Auction), that represents the range of purchase prices that the Auction Party would be willing to accept in the Auction, (iii) be     extended,     at     the     sole     discretion     of the     Auction Party, to     (x) each     Lender     and/or (y) each     Le  n  der     with     re  s  pect     to     any   Term   Loan     on an   i  ndividual     Class b  a  sis and     (iv) re  m  ain outstanding     through     the   Auction   Response Date.    T  he Auction     Agent     will     pr  om  ptly     provide     each     ap  p  ropriate     Le  n  der     with     a     copy     of the Auction     Notice     and     a     form     of the     Return Bid to     be   s  ub  m  itted     by a     respondi  n  g     Lender     to     the     Auction     Agent     (or its     delegate)     by no later     than 5:00 p.  m  .     on the   date specified in the Auction Notice (or such later date as the Auction Party may agree with the reasonable consent of the Auction Agent)   (the    Auction Response Date   ). 

(b)            Reply Procedures  .  In connection with any Auction, each Lender holding the relevant Term   Loans   subject to such Auction may, in its sole discretion, participate in such Auction and may provide the Auction Agent with a notice of participation (the    Return Bid   ) which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Auction Agent, and shall specify (i) a discount to par (that must be expressed as a price at which it is willing to sell all or any portion of such Term Loans) (the    Reply Price   ), which (when expressed as a percentage of the par principal amount of such Term Loans) must be within the Discount Range, and (ii) a principal amount of such Term Loans, which must be in whole increments of $1,000,000 (or, in any case, such lesser amount of such Term Loans of such Lender then outstanding or which is otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Auction Agent) (the    Reply Amount   ).  Lenders may only submit one Return Bid per Auction, but each Return Bid may contain up to three bids only one of which may result in a Qualifying Bid.  In addition to the Return Bid, the participating Lender must execute and deliver, to be held in escrow by the Auction Agent, an Assignment and Assumption with the dollar amount of the Term Loans to be assigned to be left in blank, which amount shall be completed by the Auction Agent (but in no such event shall the amount be in excess of the principal amount of Term Loans such Lender has indicated it is willing to sell) in accordance with the final determination of such Lender s Qualifying Bid pursuant to   clause (c)   below.  Any Lender     whose Return Bid is     not     received by the     Auction     Agent     by the     Auction     R  e  sponse     Date     shall     be     dee  m  ed     to have     declined     to     participate in the relevant Auction   with respect to   all     of its Term     Loans. 

(c)            Acceptance Procedures  .  Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received by the Auction Agent prior to the applicable Auction Response Date, the Auction Agent, in consultation with the Auction Party, will determine the applicable price (the    Applicable Price   ) for the Auction, which will be the lowest Reply Price for which the Auction Party can complete the Auction at the Auction Amount;  

provided   that, in the event that the Reply Amounts are insufficient to allow the Auction Party to complete a purchase of the entire Auction Amount (any such Auction, a    Failed Auction   ), the Auction Party shall either, at its election, (i) withdraw the Auction or (ii) complete the Auction at an Applicable Price equal to the highest Reply Price.  The Auction Party shall purchase the relevant Term Loans (or the respective portions thereof) from each Lender with a Reply Price that is equal to or lower than the Applicable Price (   Qualifying Bids   ) at the Applicable Price;   provided   that if the aggregate proceeds required to purchase all Term Loans subject to Qualifying Bids would exceed the Auction Amount for such Auction, the Auction Party shall purchase such Term Loans at the Applicable Price ratably based on the principal amounts of such Qualifying Bids (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Auction Agent in its discretion).  If a Lender has submitted a Return Bid containing multiple bids at different Reply Prices, only the bid with the lowest Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Price will be deemed to be the Qualifying Bid of such Lender (e.g., a Reply Price of $100 with a discount to par of 2%, when compared to an Applicable Price of $100 with a 1% discount to par, will not be deemed to be a Qualifying Bid, while, however, a Reply Price of $100 with a discount to par of 2.50% would be deemed to be a Qualifying Bid).  The Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five Business Days following the Auction Response Date with respect to an Auction, notify (I) the Top Borrower of the respective Lenders  responses to such solicitation, the effective date of the purchase of Term Loans pursuant to such Auction, the Applicable Price, and the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans and the tranches thereof to be purchased pursuant to such Auction, (II) each participating Lender of the effective date of the purchase of Term Loans pursuant to such Auction, the Applicable Price, and the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of Term Loans to be purchased at the Applicable Price on such date, (III) each participating Lender of the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of the Term Loans of such Lender to be purchased at the Applicable Price on such date and (IV) if applicable, each participating Lender of any rounding and/or proration pursuant to the second preceding sentence.  Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Top Borrower and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. 

(d)          Additional Procedures.   

(i)          Once initiated by an Auction Notice, the Auction Party may not withdraw an Auction other than a Failed Auction.  Furthermore, in connection with any Auction, upon submission by a Lender of a Qualifying Bid, such Lender (each, a    Qualifying Lender   ) will be obligated to sell the entirety or its allocable portion of the Reply Amount, as the case may be, at the Applicable Price. 

(ii)          To     the     exte  n  t     not     ex  p  res  s  ly     provided     for herein,     each purchase of Term Loans pursuant to an Auction shall be consummated pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions in this definition, established by the Auction Agent acting in its reasonable discretion and as reasonably agreed by the Top Borrower. 

(iii)          In connection with any Auction, the Top Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent may require as a condition to any Auction, the payment of customary fees and expenses by the Auction Party in connection therewith as agreed between the Auction Party and the Auction Agent. 

(iv)          Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, for purposes of this definition, each notice or other communication required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) shall be deemed to have been given upon the Auction Agent s (or its delegate s) actual receipt during normal business hours of such notice or communication;   provided   that any notice or communication actually received outside of normal  

2 

business hours shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of business on the next Business Day. 

(v)          the Top Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent may perform any and all of its duties under this definition by itself or through any Affiliate of the Auction Agent and expressly consent to any such delegation of duties by the Auction Agent to such Affiliate and the performance of such delegated duties by such Affiliate.  The exculpatory provisions pursuant to this Agreement shall apply to each Affiliate of the Auction Agent and its respective activities in connection with any purchase of Term Loans provided for in this definition as well as activities of the Auction Agent. 

Auction Agent    means (a) the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates or (b) any other financial institution or advisor engaged by the Top Borrower (whether or not an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent) to act as an arranger in connection with any Dutch Auction;   provided  , that the Top Borrower shall not designate the Administrative Agent as the Auction Agent without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to agree to act as the Auction Agent);   provided  ,    further  , that neither Holdings nor any of its subsidiaries may act as the Auction Agent.

SECTION 4.02            Rights as a Pari Passu Secured Party  .  The Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Pari Passu Secured Party under any Series of Pari Passu Obligations that it holds as any other Pari Passu Secured Party of such Series and may exercise the same as though it were not the Controlling Collateral Agent and the term  Pari Passu Secured Party  or  Pari Passu Secured Parties  or (as applicable)  Credit Agreement Secured Party ,  Credit Agreement Secured Parties ,  Additional Secured Party ,  Additional Secured Parties ,  Initial Additional Secured Party  or  Initial Additional Secured Parties  shall, if applicable and unless otherwise  

-15- 

expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Top Borrower or any subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to any other Pari Passu Secured Party. 

SECTION 4.03            Exculpatory Provisions  . 

(a)          The Controlling Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Pari Passu Security Documents to which it is a party.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Controlling Collateral Agent: 

(i)          shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Pari Passu Security Documents that the Controlling Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative;   provided   that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Controlling Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Pari Passu Security Document or applicable law; 

(ii)          shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Pari Passu Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Top Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; 

(iii)          shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (A) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (B) in the absence of the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith or material breach of this Agreement by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any affiliate, director, officer, employee, counsel, agent or attorney-in-fact of the Controlling Collateral Agent (in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment) or (C) in reliance on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Top Borrower stating that such action is permitted by the terms of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under any Series of Pari Passu Obligations unless and until notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Controlling Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such Pari Passu Obligations or the Top Borrower); shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (A) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Pari Passu Security Document, (B) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (C) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any default, (D) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Pari Passu Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Pari Passu Security Documents, (E) the existence, value or the sufficiency of any Collateral for any Series of Pari Passu Obligations, or (F) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any Secured Credit Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Controlling Collateral Agent; and 

(iv)          with respect to the Credit Agreement or any Additional Document, may conclusively assume that the Grantors have complied with all of their obligations thereunder unless  

-16- 

advised in writing by the Authorized Representative thereunder to the contrary specifically setting forth the alleged violation. 

(b)          Each Pari Passu Secured Party acknowledges that, in addition to acting as the initial Controlling Collateral Agent, JPM also serves as Administrative Agent (under, and as defined in, the Credit Agreement), and each Pari Passu Secured Party hereby waives any right to make any objection or claim against JPM (or any successor Controlling Collateral Agent or any of their respective counsel) based on any alleged conflict of interest or breach of duties arising from the Controlling Collateral Agent also serving as the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or Credit Agreement Administrative Agent. 

SECTION 4.04            Reliance by Controlling Collateral Agent  .  The Controlling Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Controlling Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Controlling Collateral Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may include, but shall not be limited to, counsel for any Grantor or counsel for the Applicable Authorized Representative), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 

SECTION 4.05            Delegation of Duties  .  The Controlling Collateral Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Pari Passu Security Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Controlling Collateral Agent.  The Controlling Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Affiliates.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of the Controlling Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent. 

SECTION 4.06            Non Reliance on Controlling Collateral Agent and Other Pari Passu Secured Parties  .  Each Pari Passu Secured Party acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative or any other Pari Passu Secured Party or any of their Affiliates and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Secured Credit Documents.  Each Pari Passu Secured Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative or any other Pari Passu Secured Party or any of their Affiliates and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Secured Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

desire to permit the use of  Cash Collateral  (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar Debtor Relief Law) on which the First Lien Collateral Agents or any other creditor has a Lien or to permit any Obligor to obtain financing, whether from the First Lien Claimholders or any other Person, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar Debtor Relief Law (   DIP Financing   ), then each Second Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related Second Lien Claimholders, agrees that it and its Related Second Lien Claimholders will raise no objection to, or oppose or contest (or join with or support any third party opposing, objecting or contesting), such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing (including any proposed orders for such Cash Collateral use and/or DIP Financing which are acceptable to the Directing First Lien Collateral Agent) and it and its Related Second Lien Claimholders will be deemed to have consented to such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing (including such proposed orders), and to the extent the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations are subordinated to or   pari passu   with such DIP Financing, each Second Lien Collateral Agent will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral to the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto and any customary  carve-out  agreed to on behalf of the First Lien Claimholders by the Directing First Lien Collateral Agent)   and to all adequate protection Liens granted to the First Lien Claimholders   on the same basis as the Liens securing the Second Lien Obligations are subordinated to the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations under this Agreement and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except as expressly agreed by the Directing First Lien Collateral Agent or to the extent permitted by   Section 6.3  );   provided   that the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the Second Lien Claimholders retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the use of Cash Collateral or the DIP Financing that require a specific treatment of a claim in respect of the Second Lien Obligations for purposes of a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan. 

(b)            Each Second Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related Second Lien Claimholders, agrees that it and its Related Second Lien Claimholders will not seek consultation rights in connection with, and will raise no objection or oppose or contest (or join with or support any third party objecting, opposing or contesting), a motion to sell, liquidate or otherwise Dispose of Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code if the requisite First Lien Claimholders have consented to such sale, liquidation or other Disposition;   provided   that (1) to the extent the net cash proceeds of such sale or other Disposition are used to pay the principal amount of Indebtedness for borrowed money constituting First Lien Obligations, or to reimburse disbursements under, or cash collateralize the face amount of, the First Lien Letters of Credit constituting First Lien Obligations, the Liens of the Second Lien Claimholders shall attach to any remaining proceeds and (2) such motion does not impair the rights of the Second Lien Claimholders under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (  provided   that the First Lien Obligations are paid in cash in full in connection with any such credit bid by the Second Lien Claimholders); and   further     provided  , however, that the Second Lien Claimholders may assert any objection with respect to any proposed orders to retain professionals or set bid or related procedures in connection with such sale, liquidation or Disposition that may be raised by an unsecured creditor of the Obligors. 

6.2            Relief from the Automatic Stay  .

6.3            Adequate Protection  . 

(a)          Each Second Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related Second Lien Claimholders, agrees that none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting): 

-30- 

(i)          any request by any First Lien Collateral Agent or the other First Lien Claimholders for adequate protection under any Debtor Relief Law; 

(ii)          any objection by any First Lien Collateral Agent or the other First Lien Claimholders to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on such First Lien Collateral Agent or the other First Lien Claimholders claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the Collateral; or 

(iii)          the allowance and/or payment of interest, fees or other amounts to any First Lien Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or as adequate protection under Section 361 of the Bankruptcy Code. 

(b)          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this   Section 6.3  , in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding: 

(i)          if the First Lien Claimholders (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral in connection with any use of Cash Collateral or DIP Financing, then each Second Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related Second Lien Claimholders, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral, which Lien will be subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection for the First Lien Obligations and such use of Cash Collateral or DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Lien Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations under this Agreement; and 

(ii)          the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the other Second Lien Claimholders shall only be permitted to seek adequate protection with respect to their respective rights in the Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in the form of (A) additional collateral;   provided   that as adequate protection for the First Lien Obligations, each First Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related First Lien Claimholders, is also granted a Lien on such additional collateral that is senior to any Lien granted to the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the other Second Lien Claimholders; (B) replacement Liens on the Collateral;   provided   that as adequate protection for the First Lien Obligations, each First Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related First Lien Claimholders, is also granted replacement Liens on the Collateral that are senior to any Lien granted to the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the other Second Lien Claimholders; (C) an administrative expense claim;   provided   that as adequate protection for the First Lien Obligations, each First Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related First Lien Claimholders, is also granted an administrative expense claim that is senior and prior to the administrative expense claim of the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the other Second Lien Claimholders; and (D)   cash payments with respect to current fees and expenses; provided that (1) as adequate protection for the First Lien Obligations, each First Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related First Lien Claimholders, is also granted cash payments with respect to current fees and expenses and (2) each First Lien Collateral Agent may object to the amounts of fees and expenses sought by the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the other Second Lien Claimholders; and (E)   cash payments with respect to interest on the Second Lien Obligations;   provided   that (1) as adequate protection for the First Lien Obligations, each First Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and its Related First Lien Claimholders, is also granted cash payments with respect to interest on the First Lien Obligation represented by it, (2) such cash payments do not exceed an amount equal to the interest accruing on the principal amount of Second Lien Obligations outstanding on the date such relief is granted at the interest rate under the applicable Second Lien Documents and accruing from the date the applicable Second Lien Collateral Agent is granted such relief and (3) such cash payments are  

-31- 

held in the Escrow Account as described below.  If any Second Lien Claimholder is entitled by order of a court of competent jurisdiction to receive or receives adequate protection payments for post-petition interest in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding (   Second Lien Adequate Protection Payments   ), then all such payments shall be payable or transferred to, and held in, an escrow account (the    Escrow Account   ) pursuant to terms mutually satisfactory to the Directing First Lien Collateral Agent and the Directing Second Lien Collateral Agent, in each case until the effectiveness of the plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan for, or conclusion of, that Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the First Lien Claimholders do not receive payment in full in cash of all First Lien Obligations upon the effectiveness of the plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan for, or conclusion of, that Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, then an amount contained in the Escrow Account shall be paid over to the First Lien Claimholders (the    Pay-Over Amount   ) equal to the lesser of (x) the Second Lien Adequate Protection Payments received by the Second Lien Claimholders and (y) the amount of the short-fall (the    Short Fall   ) in payment in full of the First Lien Obligations;   provided   that to the extent any portion of the Short Fall represents payments received by the First Lien Claimholders in the form of promissory notes, equity or other property equal in value to the cash paid in respect of the Pay-Over Amount, the First Lien Claimholders shall, upon receipt of the Pay-Over Amount, transfer those promissory notes, equity or other property, equal in value to the cash paid in respect of the Pay-Over Amount, to the applicable Second Lien Claimholders pro rata in exchange for the Pay-Over Amount. Upon the effectiveness of the plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan for, or conclusion of, that Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any amounts remaining in the Escrow Account after application of amounts provided for above shall be paid to the Second Lien Claimholders as their interests may appear.  It is understood and agreed that nothing in this   Section 6.3(b)   shall modify or otherwise affect the other agreements by or on behalf of the Second Lien Collateral Agents and the other Second Lien Claimholders set forth in this Agreement (including the agreements to raise no objection to, or oppose or contest, that are set forth in   Section 6.1  ).  To the extent the First Lien Collateral Agents are not granted such adequate protection in the applicable form, any amounts recovered by or distributed to any Second Lien Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Claimholder pursuant to or as a result of any such additional collateral, any such replacement Lien, any such administrative expense claim or any such cash payment shall be subject to   Section 4.2  . 

6.4            No Waiver  .  Subject to   Section 6.7(b)  , nothing contained herein shall prohibit or in any way limit any First Lien Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder from objecting in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to any action taken by any Second Lien Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Claimholders, including the seeking by any Second Lien Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Claimholders of adequate protection or the asserting by any Second Lien Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Claimholders of any of its rights and remedies under the Second Lien Financing Documents or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the First Lien Claimholders shall not be deemed to have consented to, and expressly retain their rights to object to, the grant of adequate protection in the form of cash payments to the Second Lien Claimholders made pursuant to   Section 6.3(b)  .   

6.5            Reinstatement  .  If any First Lien Claimholder is required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of any Obligor any amount paid in respect of First Lien Obligations (a    Recovery   ), then such First Lien Claimholder shall be entitled to a reinstatement of its First Lien Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts on the date of such Recovery, and from and after the date of such reinstatement the Discharge of First Lien Obligations shall be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes hereunder.  If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties  

-32- 

hereto from such date of reinstatement.  Any amounts received by any Second Lien Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Claimholder on account of the Second Lien Obligations after the termination of this Agreement shall, upon a reinstatement of this Agreement pursuant to this   Section 6.5  , be held in trust for and paid over to the Directing First Lien Collateral Agent for the benefit of the First Lien Claimholders, for application to the reinstated First Lien Obligations.  This   Section 6.5   shall survive termination of this Agreement. 

6.6            Reorganization Securities  .  If, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, arrangement, compromise or liquidation or similar dispositive restructuring plan, both on account of First Lien Obligations and on account of Second Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the First Lien Obligations and on account of the Second Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same property, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations. 

6.7            Post-Petition Interest  . 

(a)          Each Second Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related Second Lien Claimholders, agrees that neither it nor its Related Second Lien Claimholders shall oppose or seek to challenge (or join with any other Person opposing or challenging) any claim by any First Lien Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of First Lien Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest.  Regardless of whether any such claim for Post-Petition Interest is allowed or allowable, and without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement expressly is intended to include, and does include the  rule of explicitness,  and is intended to provide the First Lien Claimholders with the right to receive payment of all Post-Petition Interest through distributions made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement even though such Post-Petition Interest may not be not allowed or allowable against the bankruptcy estate of the Top Borrower or any other Obligor under Section 502(b)(2) or Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other Debtor Relief Law. 

(b)          Subject to   Section 6.3(b)  , none of any First Lien Collateral Agent nor any of its Related First Lien Claimholders shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by any Second Lien Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Claimholder for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Second Lien Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of the Lien of any Second Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Second Lien Claimholders, on the Collateral (after taking into account the amount of the First Lien Obligations). 

6.8            Waivers  .  (a) Each Second Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related Second Lien Claimholders, waives any claim it or its Related Second Lien Claimholders may hereafter have against any First Lien Claimholder arising out of (a) the election of any First Lien Claimholder of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code or (b) any cash collateral or financing arrangement, or any grant of a security interest in connection with the Collateral, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding so long as such actions are not in express contravention of the terms of this Agreement. 

(b)            Each Second Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related Second Lien Claimholders, agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Debtor Relief Law senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral. 

-33- 

6.9            Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification; Voting on Plan  .  Each Second Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related Second Lien Claimholders, and each First Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related First Lien Claimholders, acknowledges and agrees that: 

(a)          the grants of Liens pursuant to the First Lien Collateral Documents and the Second Lien Collateral Documents constitute, and, in the case of the Shared Collateral Documents, are intended to constitute, two separate and distinct grants of Liens; 

(b)          because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral (including the Shared Collateral), the Second Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the First Lien Obligations and must, subject to applicable law, be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed or adopted in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding; and 

(c)          the Second Lien Claimholders agree that they will not propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization unless such plan (i) provides for the payment in full in cash of all the First Lien Obligations or (ii) is supported by the First Lien Claimholders required under applicable law to approve a plan. 

To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the First Lien Claimholders and the Second Lien Claimholders in respect of the Collateral (including the Shared Collateral) constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to   Sections 2.1   and   4.1  , all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Obligors in respect of the Collateral (including the Shared Collateral) (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Second Lien Claimholders), the First Lien Claimholders shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing (or that would be owing if there were such separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) in respect of Post-Petition Interest, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the First Lien Documents arising from or related to a default, regardless of whether any such claim is allowed or allowable in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by the Second Lien Claimholders with respect to the Collateral (including the Shared Collateral), with each Second Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of its Related Second Lien Claimholders, hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Directing First Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Claimholders, Collateral (including the Shared Collateral) or proceeds of Collateral (including the Shared Collateral) or any other distribution (whether or not expressly characterized as such) in respect of the Collateral, otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Second Lien Claimholders. 

6.10            Effectiveness in Insolvency Proceedings  .  The parties acknowledge that this Agreement is a  subordination agreement  under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and under comparable provisions of any other applicable Debtor Relief Law, which will be effective before, during and after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. All references in this Agreement to any Obligor will include such Person as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Person in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

7.3            No Waiver of Lien Priorities  . 

(a)          No right of the First Lien Collateral Agents or any other First Lien Claimholders, or any of them, to enforce any provision of this Agreement or of any First Lien Document shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of any Obligor or by any act or failure to act by any First Lien Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder, or by any

noncompliance by any Person with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, any of the First Lien Documents or any of the Second Lien Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof which the First Lien Collateral Agents or the other First Lien Claimholders, or any of them, may have or be otherwise charged with.

-44- 

Directing First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Claimholders or the Directing Second Lien Collateral Agent and the Second Lien Claimholders, as applicable.

In any event, if a respective intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement) exists, the provisions thereof shall not be (or be construed to be) an amendment, modification or other change to this Agreement or any other First Lien Document or Second Lien Document, and the provisions of this Agreement and the other First Lien Documents and Second Lien Documents shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (as such provisions may be amended, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, including to give effect to any intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement)). 

(b)          In addition, in the event that the Top Borrower or any of its subsidiaries incurs any obligations in respect of Indebtedness that is permitted by the First Lien Documents and the Second Lien Documents to be secured by a Lien on any Collateral that is junior to the Liens thereon securing any First Lien Obligations and all Second Lien Obligations and such obligations are not designated by the Top Borrower as Second Lien Obligations, then the First Lien Collateral Agents and/or the Second Lien Collateral Agents shall upon the request of the Top Borrower enter into an intercreditor agreement that is reasonably satisfactory to the First Lien Collateral Agents and the Second Lien Collateral Agents with the holders of such other obligations (or their agent, trustee or other representative) to reflect the relative Lien priorities of such parties with respect to the Collateral (or the relevant portion thereof) and governing the relative rights, benefits and privileges as among such parties in respect of such Collateral, including as to application of the proceeds of such Collateral, voting rights, control of such Collateral and waivers with respect to such Collateral, in each case, so long as such secured obligations are not prohibited by, and the terms of such intercreditor agreement do not violate or conflict with, the provisions of this Agreement or any of the First Lien Documents or Second Lien Documents, as the case may be, and are no less favorable to the Top Borrower or any Loan Party than the terms of this Agreement.  If any such intercreditor agreement is entered into, the provisions thereof shall not be (or be construed to be) an amendment, modification or other change to this Agreement or any First Lien Documents or Second Lien Documents, and the provisions of this Agreement, the First Lien Documents and the Second Lien Documents shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (as such provisions may be amended, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time in accordance with the respective terms thereof, including to give effect to any intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement)) and in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of such other intercreditor agreement as

(iii)            without notice (except as specifically provided in   Section 7.01   or elsewhere herein), demand or advertisement of any kind to any Grantor or any other Person, personally, or by agents or attorneys, enter the premises of any Grantor where any Collateral is located (through self-help and without judicial process) to collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, sell, lease, assign, grant an option or options to purchase or otherwise dispose of, deliver, or realize upon, the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at one or more public or private sales (which sales may be adjourned or continued from time to time with or without notice and may take place at such Grantor s premises or elsewhere), for cash, on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable; 

(iv)            upon at least three Business Days  written notice to the Top Borrower, transfer and register in its name or in the name of its nominee the whole or any part of the Pledged Collateral, to exercise the voting and all other rights as a holder with respect thereto (whereupon the voting and other rights of such Grantor described in   Section 4.02(d)(i)   above shall immediately cease such that the Collateral Agent shall have the sole right to exercise such voting and other rights while the relevant Event of Default exists), to collect and receive all cash dividends, interest, principal and other distributions made thereon (it being understood that all Stock Rights received by any Grantor while the relevant Event of Default exists shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral  

11

(v)            to take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, by directing such Grantor in writing to deliver the same to the Collateral Agent at any reasonable place or places designated by the Collateral Agent, in which event such Grantor shall at its own expense: 

(1)            forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places so designated by the Collateral Agent and there delivered to the Collateral Agent; 

(2)            store and keep any Collateral so delivered to the Collateral Agent at such place or places pending further action by the Collateral Agent; and 

(3)            while the Collateral shall be so stored and kept, provide such security and maintenance services as shall be reasonably necessary to protect the same and to preserve and maintain it in good condition. 

(b)            Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that compliance by the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, with any applicable state or federal Requirements of Law in connection with a disposition of the Collateral will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. 

(c)            The Collateral Agent shall have the right in any public sale and, to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, in any private sale, to purchase for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, all or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right of equity redemption, which equity redemption each Grantor hereby expressly releases.

(e)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to (i) make any demand upon, or pursue or exhaust any of their rights or remedies against, the Grantors, any other obligor, guarantor, pledgor or any other Person with respect to the payment of the Secured Obligations or to pursue or exhaust any of their rights or remedies with respect to any Collateral therefor or any direct or indirect guarantee thereof, (ii) marshal the Collateral or any guarantee of the Secured Obligations or to resort to the Collateral or any such guarantee in any particular order, or (iii) effect a public sale of any Collateral. 

(f)            Each Grantor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Collateral and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof.  Each Grantor also acknowledges that any private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that no such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonable manner solely by virtue of such sale being private.  The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit any Grantor or the issuer of any Pledged  

12 

Collateral to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under applicable state securities Requirements of Law, even if any Grantor and the issuer would agree to do so.

Section 5.03            Intellectual Property Remedies  .    (a)    For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise the rights and remedies under this   Article 5   at any time when an Event of Default exists and at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent a power of attorney to sign any document which may be required by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, domain name registrar or similar registrar in order to effect an absolute assignment of all right, title and interest in each registered Patent, Trademark, Domain Name and Copyright and each application for any such registration, and record the same.

The use of the license granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence may be exercised, at the option of the Collateral Agent, only when an Event of Default exists;   provided   that, any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance with this   clause (b)   shall be binding upon each Grantor notwithstanding any subsequent cure of the relevant Event of Default. 

Section 5.04            Application of Proceeds  .    (a)    Subject to any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other realization of any Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of Cash, as set forth in   Section 2.18(b)   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement.

To the extent that applicable Requirements of Law impose duties on the Collateral Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that it would be commercially reasonable for the Collateral Agent (a) to elect not to incur expenses to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to transform raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (b) to elect not to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) to elect not to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as any Grantor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (g) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (h) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (j) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (k) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Collateral Agent against risks of loss in connection with any collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Collateral Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral or (l) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist the Collateral Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral.  Each Grantor acknowledges that the purpose of this   Section 7.02   is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Collateral Agent would be commercially reasonable in the Collateral Agent s exercise of remedies with respect to the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Collateral Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this   Section 7.02  .  Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this   Section 7.02   shall be construed to grant any rights to any Grantor or to impose any duties on the Collateral Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this   Section 7.02  . 

Section 7.03            Compromises and Collection of Collateral  .  Each Grantor and the Collateral Agent recognize that setoffs, counterclaims, defenses and other claims may be asserted by obligors with respect to certain of the Receivables, that certain of the Receivables may be or become uncollectible in whole or in part and that the expense and probability of success in litigating a disputed Receivable may exceed the amount that reasonably may be expected to be recovered with respect to any Receivable.  In view of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Collateral Agent may at any time and from time to time, if an Event of Default exists, compromise with the obligor on any Receivable, accept in full payment of any Receivable such amount as the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion shall determine or abandon any Receivable, and  

17 

any such action by the Collateral Agent shall be commercially reasonable so long as the Collateral Agent acts in good faith based on information known to it at the time it takes any such action. 

Section 7.04            Collateral Agent Performance of Debtor Obligations  .  Without having any obligation to do so, the Collateral Agent may, at any time when an Event of Default exists and upon prior notice to the Top Borrower, perform or pay any obligation which any Grantor has agreed to perform or pay under this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement and which obligation is due and unpaid and not being contested by such Grantor in good faith, and such Grantor shall reimburse the Collateral Agent for any amounts paid by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this   Section 7.04   as a Secured Obligation payable in accordance with   Section 9.03(a)   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement. 

Section 7.05            No Waiver; Amendments; Cumulative Remedies  .  No delay or omission of the Collateral Agent (subject to the provisions of   Section 8.01   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement) to exercise any right or remedy granted under this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement shall impair such right or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.  No waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Grantors and the Collateral Agent with the concurrence or at the direction of the Lenders to the extent required under   Section 9.02   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All rights and remedies contained in this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement or afforded by law shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Collateral Agent until the Termination Date. 

Section 7.06            Limitation by Law; Severability of Provisions  .  All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable Requirements of Law, and all of the provisions of this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory Requirements of Law that may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that such provisions do not render this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement invalid, unenforceable or not entitled to be recorded or registered, in whole or in part.  To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any provision of this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

Section 7.07            Security Interest Absolute  .  All rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the security interests granted hereunder and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Secured Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating to the foregoing, (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Lien on any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guaranty, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Secured Obligations, (d) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of any Grantor, (e) any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of, any right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of this Amended and Restated First Lien Security

Agreement or any other Loan Document or (f) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Secured Obligations or this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement (other than a termination of any Lien contemplated by   Section 7.12   or the occurrence of the Termination Date). 

Section 7.08            Benefit of Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement  .  The terms and provisions of this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Grantor, the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns (including all Persons who become bound as a debtor to this Amended and Restated First Lien Security Agreement).  No sale of participations, assignments, transfers, or other dispositions of any agreement governing the Secured Obligations or any portion thereof or interest therein shall in any manner impair the Lien granted to the Collateral Agent hereunder for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties.

LOAN GUARANTY 

Section 2.01            Guaranty  .  Except as otherwise provided for herein (including under   Section 3.15  ), each Loan Guarantor hereby agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for, and, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, and absolutely and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent (acting as agent for the Secured Parties, pursuant to   Article 8   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement) for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, the full and prompt payment, when and as the same become due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of the Secured Obligations, including amounts that would become due but for the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.  362(a) (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Swap Obligation), together with any and all expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in collecting any of the Guaranteed Obligations that are reimbursable in accordance with   Section 9.03   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement (collectively the    Guaranteed Obligations   ).  Each Loan Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be increased, extended or renewed in whole or in part without notice to or further assent from it, and that it remains bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any such extension or renewal.  In addition, if any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations become due and payable hereunder, each Loan Guarantor, unconditionally and irrevocably, promises to pay such Guaranteed Obligations to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, on demand.  Each Loan Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations whether or not due or payable by any Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the Events of Default specified in   Sections 7.01(f)   or   7.01(g)   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement and thereafter irrevocably and unconditionally promises to pay such Guaranteed Obligations to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties.  This Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty is a continuing one and shall remain in full force and effect until the Termination Date, and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. 

Section 2.02            Guaranty of Payment  .  This Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.  Each Loan Guarantor waives any right to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to sue any Borrower, any Loan Guarantor, any other guarantor, or any other Person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (each of the Borrowers, each Loan Guarantor, each other guarantor or such other Person, an    Obligated Party   ), or otherwise to enforce its rights in respect of any Collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Administrative Agent may enforce this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty at any time when an Event of Default exists. 

Section 2.03            No Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty  .   

(a)            Except as otherwise provided for herein (including under   Section 3.15  ), the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are unconditional, irrevocable and absolute and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including: (i) any claim of waiver, release,  

3 

extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration, or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Obligated Party; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any other Obligated Party, or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Obligated Party; (iv) the existence of any claim, setoff or other right which any Loan Guarantor may have at any time against any Obligated Party, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions; (v) any direction as to application of payments by any Borrower or by any other party; (vi) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking; (viii) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by any Borrower or (ix) any payment made to any Secured Party on the Guaranteed Obligations which any such Secured Party repays to any Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Loan Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding. 

(b)            Except for termination of a Loan Guarantor s obligations hereunder or as expressly permitted by   Section 3.15  , the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are not subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, or any Requirements of Law purporting to prohibit payment by any Obligated Party, of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. 

(c)            Further, the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of any Borrower for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other guarantor of or other Person liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Loan Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, in each case other than as set forth in   Section 3.15  . 

Section 2.04            Defenses Waived  .  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, and except for termination of a Loan Guarantor s obligations hereunder or as otherwise provided for herein (including under   Section 3.15  ), each Loan Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor or arising out of the disability of any Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor or any other party or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any notice not provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, including any notice of nonperformance, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of acceptance of this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty, and any notice of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Obligated Party, or any other Person, including any right (except as may be required by applicable Requirements of Law and to the extent the relevant requirement cannot be waived) to require the Administrative Agent to (i) proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Borrower,  

4 

any other Loan Guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent s power whatsoever.  The Administrative Agent may, at its election and in accordance with the terms of the applicable Loan Documents, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law), accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any Collateral securing all or a part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Administrative Agent may, at its election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Obligated Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Obligated Party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Loan Guarantor under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty, except as otherwise provided in   Section 3.15  .  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, each Loan Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election may operate, pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Loan Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security. 

Section 2.05            Authorization  .  Each Loan Guarantor authorizes the Administrative Agent without notice or demand (except as may be required by applicable Requirements of Law and to the extent the relevant requirement cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder (except as set forth in   Section 3.15  ), from time to time, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the referenced Loan Documents, to: 

(a)            change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest or fees thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered; 

(b)            take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset there against; 

(c)            exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Borrower, any other Loan Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting; 

(d)            release or substitute any endorser, any guarantor, any Borrower, any other Loan Party and/or any other obligor; 

(e)            settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Borrower to its creditors other than the Secured Parties; 

(f)            apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Borrower to the Secured Parties regardless of what liability or liabilities of any Borrower remain unpaid; 

(g)            consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty, the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit  

5 

Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Hedge Agreement with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligation or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty, the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Hedge Agreement with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligation or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or 

(h)            take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of the Loan Guarantors from their respective liabilities under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty. 

Section 2.06            Rights of Subrogation  .  No Loan Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of action, including any claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Loan Party in respect of this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty until the occurrence of the Termination Date;   provided   that if any amount is paid to such Loan Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the Termination Date, then unless such Loan Guarantor has already discharged its liabilities under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty in an amount equal to such Loan Guarantor s Maximum Liability as of such date, such amount shall be held by the recipient Loan Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid by the recipient Loan Guarantor to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with   Section 2.18(b)   of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement.  

Section 2.07            Reinstatement; Stay of Acceleration  .  If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, each Loan Guarantor s obligations under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the other Loan Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent. 

Section 2.08            Information  .  Each Loan Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Borrower s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Loan Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Secured Party shall have any duty to advise any Loan Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks. 

Section 2.09            Contribution; Subordination; Maximum Liability  .   

(a)            In the event that any Loan Guarantor (a    Paying Guarantor   ) makes any payment or payments under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty or suffers any loss as a result of any realization upon any Collateral granted by it to secure its obligations under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty (each such payment or loss, an    Accommodation Payment   ), each other Loan Guarantor (each a    Non-Paying Guarantor   ) shall contribute to such Paying Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Guarantor s  Guarantor Percentage  of such Accommodation Payment by such Paying Guarantor.  For purposes of this   Article 2  , each Non-Paying Guarantor s    Guarantor Percentage    with respect to any Accommodation Payment by a Paying Guarantor shall be determined as of the date on which such Accommodation Payment was made by reference to the ratio of (a) such Non-Paying Guarantor s  

6 

Maximum Liability (as defined below) as of such date to (b) the aggregate Maximum Liability of all Loan Guarantors hereunder (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date.  As of any date of determination, the    Maximum Liability    of each Loan Guarantor shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability which could be asserted against such Loan Guarantor hereunder and under the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement without (i) rendering such Loan Guarantor  insolvent  within the meaning of Section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (   UFTA   ) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraud Conveyance Act (   UFCA   ), (ii) leaving such Loan Guarantor with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (iii) leaving such Loan Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA.  Nothing in this provision shall affect any Loan Guarantor s several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Loan Guarantor s Maximum Liability).  Each of the Loan Guarantors covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Secured Obligations until the Termination Date.  If, prior to the Termination Date, any such contribution payment is received by a Paying Guarantor at any time when an Event of Default exists, such contribution payment shall be collected, enforced and received by such Loan Guarantor as trustee for the Secured Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on account of the Secured Obligations, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Loan Guarantor under the other provisions of this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty.  This provision is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties. 

(b)            It is the desire and intent of the Loan Guarantors and the Secured Parties that this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty shall be enforced against the Loan Guarantors to the fullest extent permissible under the Requirements of Law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  The provisions of this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Requirements of Law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Loan Guarantor under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Loan Guarantor s liability under this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Loan Guarantors or the Secured Parties, be automatically limited and reduced to such Loan Guarantor s Maximum Liability.  Each Loan Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of such Loan Guarantor without impairing this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent hereunder;   provided   that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to increase any Loan Guarantor s obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability. 

Section 2.10            Representations and Warranties  .  As, when (including on the date hereof) and to the extent required in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, each Loan Guarantor hereby makes each applicable representation and warranty made in the Loan Documents by the Borrowers with respect to such Loan Guarantor and each Loan Guarantor hereby further acknowledges and agrees that such Loan Guarantor has, independently and without reliance upon any Secured Party and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Amended and Restated First Lien Loan Guaranty and each other Loan Document to which it is or is to be a party, and such Loan Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining from each other Loan Guarantor on a continuing basis information pertaining to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties and prospects of each other Loan Guarantor. 

7 

Section 2.11            Covenants  .  Each Loan Guarantor covenants and agrees that, until the Termination Date, such Loan Guarantor will perform and observe, and cause each of its subsidiaries that constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary to perform and observe, all of the terms, covenants and agreements set forth in the Loan Documents that the Top Borrower has agreed to cause such Loan Guarantor or such subsidiary to perform or observe.  Until the Termination Date, no Guarantor shall, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding against any Borrower or any Guarantor (it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this   Section 2.11   shall prohibit any Guarantor from commencing or joining with any Borrower or Guarantor as a co-debtor in any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding). 

Article 3
