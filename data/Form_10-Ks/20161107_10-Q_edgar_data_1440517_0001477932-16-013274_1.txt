GREENFIELD FARMS FOOD, INC.    NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The following interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2014. In the opinion of management, the interim unaudited financial statements furnished herein include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented.     The consolidated financial statements for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 include the financial statements of the Company and its operating subsidiary Carmela s Pizzeria.      The statements of operations and cash flows reflect the results of operations and the changes in cash flows of the Company for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.      NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, liabilities, and commitments in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a working capital deficit and has incurred significant losses since inception. Further losses are anticipated raising substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to acquire sufficient capital from its investors with which to pursue its business plan. There can be no assurance that the future operations will be significant and profitable, or that the Company will have sufficient resources to meet its objectives. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional funds.      NOTE 3   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS      Greenfield Farms Food, Inc. ( GRAS  or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 2, 2008. In October 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with COHP, LLC ( COHP ) through which the Company acquired certain of the assets and liabilities of COHP including the operations of Carmela s Pizzeria ( Carmela s ) through a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary Carmela s Pizzeria CO, Inc. Carmela's Pizzeria presently has three Dayton, Ohio area locations offering authentic New York style pizza. Carmela's offers a full service menu for Dine In, Carry out and Delivery, catering as well as pizza buffets in select stores.              NOTE 4   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Accounting Basis   The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP  accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 year end.      Use of Estimates and Assumptions   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate methodologies; however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting information necessary to develop these estimates. Accordingly, the Company s estimates of fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.     The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, deferred charges, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable approximate their carrying amounts because of the short maturities of these instruments.     The fair values of notes and loans payable to non-related parties approximate their carrying values because of the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt to non-related parties approximates carrying values, net of discounts applied, based on market rates currently available to the Company.     Fair value measurements are determined under a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ).     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market approach ). The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly.     The highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.            The three hierarchy levels are defined as follows:     Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;     Level 2   Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;     Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.     The Company has determined that its derivative liabilities fall under Level 2. Derivative liabilities were $547,802 and $572,565 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.      Income Taxes   The Company has elected to be taxed as a  C  corporation. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.      Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There were warrants outstanding convertible into 179,886 shares of common stock at June 30, 2016. Basic and diluted loss per share was the same for each period presented as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.      Dividends   The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown.      Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.             Advertising Costs   The Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $16,247 and $9,173 during the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Property and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the three to five year estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense totaled $10,691 and $12,450 for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Stock-Based Compensation   Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company did not issue any stock-based payments to its employees.      Accounting Pronouncements   No accounting standards or interpretations issued or recently adopted are expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, operations or cash flows.      NOTE 5   NOTES PAYABLE      The Company has outstanding a promissory note for $50,000 issued in 2011. The note is secured by the Company s common stock, bears 8% interest, and was due on January 26, 2012. The note is currently in default with a default interest rate of 12%.

Additional notes in the amount of $300 outstanding at December 31, 2015 and accrued interest of $17 was repaid during the six month period ended June 30, 2016.      NOTE 6   NOTES PAYABLE   RELATED PARTIES      Entities controlled by the members have loaned monies to COHP for working capital purposes. The loans are non-interest bearing and have no specific terms of repayment. A related party loan from KB Air is secured by all the assets of the Company.

The note is convertible by the holder after 180 days at 45% of the lowest trading price in the thirty trading days before the conversion. The entire balance of this note remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively.     On November 16, 2015 the Company issued a convertible promissory note to Cresthill Associates in the principal amount of $7,500 due on August 16, 2016 with an interest rate of 8% per annum in exchange for amounts payable to Cresthill for services rendered. The note is convertible by the holder after 180 days at 45% of the lowest last sales price in the thirty trading days before the conversion. The entire balance of this note remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively.     On March 4, 2016 the Company issued a convertible promissory note to CareBourn Capital in the principal amount of $33,000 due on April 20, 2016 with an interest rate of 12% per annum. Debt issuance costs of $3,000 were recorded for net proceeds to the Company of $30,000. The note is convertible by the holder after 90 days at 40% of the lowest closing bid price in the ninety trading days before the conversion. The entire balance of this note remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, respectively.     Total interest expense on these notes was $17,839 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.     A summary of convertible notes payable as of June 30, 2016 is as follows:            NOTE 8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY      The Company has determined that the conversion features of certain of its notes represent an embedded derivative since the notes are convertible into a variable number of shares upon conversion. Accordingly, they are not considered to be conventional debt under EITF 00-19 and the embedded conversion feature must be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. The fair value of this derivative instrument has been recorded as a liability on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as a discount to the notes. Such discount will be accreted from the commencing date of conversion period to the maturity date of the notes. The change in the fair value of the derivative liability will be recorded in other income or expenses in the statement of operations at the end of each period, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet.            The beneficial conversion feature included in the notes that became convertible during the six months ended June 30, 2016 resulted in initial note discounts of $61,100 and an initial loss on the valuation of the derivative liabilities of $89,175 based on the initial fair value of the derivative liabilities of $150,275. The fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities for notes not in default were calculated at the conversion commencement dates utilizing the following assumptions:           At June 30, 2016, the following notes remained convertible and not fully converted. All convertible notes beyond their maturity dates totaling $345,549 in principal payable are valued assuming a six month term for purposes of calculating the derivative liability.The fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities on the outstanding convertible notes was calculated at June 30, 2016 utilizing the following assumptions:            NOTE 9   CAPITAL STOCK        Common Stock       The Company has authorized 3,950,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.       2016 Common Stock Issuances      During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 213,722,083 shares of common stock upon conversion of $10,040 in principal and interest on convertible notes representing a value of $0.00005 per share. In addition, we incurred loss on conversion of certain of the shares totaling $16,617 for a total cost to the Company of $26,657.              Preferred Stock       The Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock par value $0.001.     The Company authorized 100,000 Series A preferred shares and issued 96,623 Series A shares. The Series A shares have immediate voting rights equivalent to 7,000 shares of common stock for each Series A share and may be converted after a minimum one-year hold at the same rate. This gives effective control of the Company to the holders of the Series A preferred shares. The terms called for no conversion or Series A shares coming into the market from these sources until March 28, 2012 at the earliest. As of June 30, 2016 no conversion has taken place.     On July 15, 2013, the board of directors of the Company authorized the creation of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which consists of up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock with par value of $0.001 per share and a stated value of $1.00 per share. A total of 44,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued on the conversion of debt payable by the Company, including $40,000 to the Company's then Chief Financial Officer, Henry Fong. The Series B Convertible Preferred is convertible to common stock at 100% of the stated value divided by 45% of the lowest trading price of the Company's common stock for the 90 trading days immediately preceding the Conversion Date. The Series B Preferred Stock has voting rights on an as if converted basis on the date of any vote to come before the Company's shareholders.     Effective September 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 1,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to Mr. Ronald Heineman, our Chief Executive Officer, in consideration for services rendered to the Company and continuing to work for the Company without receiving significant payment for services and without the Company having the ability to issue shares of common stock as the Company did not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to allow for any such issuances. As a result of the issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock shares, Mr. Heineman obtained voting rights over the Company s outstanding voting stock on September 24, 2014, which provide him the right to vote up to 51% of the total voting shares able to vote on any and all shareholder matters. As a result, Mr. Heineman will exercise majority control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of Directors, mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Heineman may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are adverse to other shareholders. Additionally, it may be impossible for shareholders to remove Mr. Heineman as an officer or Director of the Company due to the Super Majority Voting Rights. In the event Mr. Heineman is no longer acting as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, the shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically, without any action on the part of any party, or the Corporation, be deemed cancelled in their entirety.       Warrants       In connection with the acquisition in 2013 of the assets of Carmela s Pizzeria, COHP, LLC and its assigns received warrants to purchase a total of 179,886 shares of the Company s common stock for a period of five years in the amounts and exercise prices as follows: 59,962 at $3.00; 59,962 at $6.00; and 59,962 at $7.50. These warrants were valued in the year ended December 31, 2013 utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model for a total fair market value at issuance of $507,280.      NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      During the period from July 1, 2016 to the filing of this report, the Company has issued __________ shares of common stock upon the conversion of $_______ in principal and interest on its convertible notes.     In accordance with SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10) the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to June 30, 2016 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any additional material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements other than those reported above.

Additionally, we do not undertake any responsibility to update you on the occurrence of any unanticipated events which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.      The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as filed with the SEC and other financial information contained elsewhere in this report.      Overview      Our operations consist of Carmela's Pizzeria s, which presently has three Dayton, Ohio area locations offering authentic New York style pizza. Carmela's offers a full service menu for Dine In, Carry out and Delivery, catering as well as pizza buffets in select stores. Carmela s has been noted in Dayton Daily News as one of  The Best Pizzerias  in Dayton.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      GENERAL. Overall, we had a net loss of $125,106 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. During the six month period, we had cash flow used by operations of $97,272, cash flows used in investing activities of $9,162 and cash flows provided by financing activities of $128,788. At the end of the six month period ended June 30, 2016, our cash balance was $76,777.     CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. Net cash flow used in operating activities was $97,272, which included non-cash adjustments to derivative liabilities from convertible notes payable totaling $8,746 related to our convertible notes outstanding. The adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash for changes in assets and liabilities for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 totaled $25,889 with increases in accounts payable accounting for the largest increase. We had $10,691 in depreciation expense during the three month period.     CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we used $9,162 for the purchase of property and equipment to operate the various Carmela s restaurant locations.     CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, cash flows from financing activities was $128,788, which consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of convertible notes payable of $33,000 and proceeds from notes payable related parties totaling $100,455 that was offset by $4,667 for payments made on notes and convertible notes payable.     INTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. There is no assurance that funds from our operations will meet the requirements of our daily operations in the future. As we expect that funds from our operations will be insufficient to meet our operating requirements as a public company and for future expansion, we will need to seek other sources of financing to maintain liquidity. This will most likely include further convertible notes and other security instruments that will incur substantial continued dilution to our current stockholders.     EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. We intend to pursue all potential financing options in 2016 as we look to secure additional funds to both stabilize and grow our business operations. Our management will review any financing options at their disposal and will judge each potential source of funds on its individual merits. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional funds from debt or equity financing, as and when we need to or if we can, that the terms of such financing will be favorable or non-dilutive to us or our existing shareholders. We anticipate we will be required to issue additional promissory notes convertible into shares of our common stock at significant discounts to market prices that will result in significant and sustained dilution to our current stockholders.            INFLATION. Our management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations, and does not expect that it will in the remainder of the fiscal year 2016.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.       Six month period ended June 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2015      We had a net loss of $125,106 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $1,157,369 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our gross sales in the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $768,622 with cost of goods sold of $586,528 for a gross profit of $182,094. This compared to gross sales of $856,628 with cost of goods sold of $746,918 for a gross profit of $109,710 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our sales in the 2016 period decreased $88,006, or approximately 10% versus 2015 primarily due to operating only three stores in the 2016 period versus four stores in the 2015 period, which was partially offset by increased catering sales in the 2016 period. Cost of goods sold decreased by approximately 21% to approximately 76% of sales in 2016 versus 87% of sales in 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of lower operating costs for Carmela s catering business which operates with higher profit margins. The Company anticipates this trend will continue in the short-term future as it works to increase catering sales.     Total operating expenses were $278,683 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 versus $349,656 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 resulting in loss from operations of $96,589 and $239,946 in the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. There were many factors involved in this significant decrease in operating expenses including significant decreases in legal, accounting and professional fees as a $50,000 note was issued for professional fees in the 2015 period and decreased rent due to operating only three stores in 2016. Advertising costs increased in 2016 with more aggressive coupon and marketing campaigns versus 2015.       Other Expenses      Other expenses were $28,517 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $917,423 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This significant change is due to the derivative liabilities related to the Company s convertible notes outstanding. This significant change is due entirely to the derivative liabilities related to the Company s convertible notes outstanding. The single largest cause was the  change in derivative liability  due to significantly fewer conversions on notes as well as very little change in the price of the Company s common stock during the period that affected volatility calculations for the valuations. The derivative liability income may not be indicative of expectations for future periods as the Company may continue to issue convertible notes, which will result in increased derivative liability expense. Issuances of further notes cause changes in derivative liabilities as well as increased expense due to notes converted at discounts to market causing losses on conversion.      Three month period ended June 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2015      We had a net loss of $65,547 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $891,329 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This significant change is primarily due to the significantly decreased change in derivative liability due to significantly fewer conversions on notes as well as very little change in the price of the Company s common stock during the period that affected volatility calculations. An additional factor was a significant decrease in derivative expense in 2016 versus 2015 with significantly fewer notes becoming convertible in the 2016 period. Our gross sales in the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $391,530 with cost of goods sold of $284,647 for a gross profit of $106,883. This compared to gross sales of $464,339, costs of goods sold of $403,047 and gross profit of $61,292 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our sales in the 2016 period decreased $72,809, or approximately 16% versus 2015. Cost of goods sold decreased by approximately 29% to approximately 72% of sales in 2016 versus approximately 87% of sales in 2015. The decreased sales are primarily the result of only three stores in the 2016 period versus four stores in the 2015 period, however the loss of one store was partially offset with a new catering menu being offered that produces higher profit margins and thus the decrease in cost of goods sold. The Company believes its catering operations will continue to provide higher profit margins in 2016 as the Company also seeks to open a fourth location during the year.            Total operating expenses were $132,036 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 versus $217,121 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 resulting in loss from operations of $25,153 and $155,829 in the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. There were various different factors involved in the decrease in operating expenses in 2016 versus 2015 the single largest of which was a decrease in professional fees due primarily to a $50,000 note issued for fees in 2015 along with certain other. Advertising expense increased in the 2016 period with a more aggressive couponing and marketing campaign.      Other (Income) Expenses      Other income was $40,394 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to other expense of $735,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This significant change is due entirely to the derivative liabilities related to the Company s convertible notes outstanding. The single largest cause was from decreased change in derivative liability due to significantly fewer conversions on notes as well as very little change in the price of the Company s common stock during the 2016 period that affected volatility calculations for the valuations. A significant decrease in derivative expense was also seen in 2016 versus 2015 as the Company issued fewer notes in both late 2015 and 2016 that became convertible in 2016 thereby resulting in reduced derivative liability expense. The lower derivative liability expense may not be indicative of expectations for future periods as the Company may continue to issue convertible notes. Issuances of further notes cause changes in derivative liabilities as well as increased expense due to notes converted at discounts to market causing losses on conversion.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.      Not Applicable.      ITEM 4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the  Certifying Officers ) are responsible for maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. The controls and procedures established by us are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.     To evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we have adopted the framework prescribed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We believe that this framework will assist in the provision of reasonable assurance of the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, the reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In adopting the COSO framework, we maintain a control environment, perform risk assessments, carry out control activities, emphasize quality information and effective communication, and perform monitoring. In the maintenance of a control environment, we are committed to integrity and ethical values as well as to competence. We strive to assign authority and responsibility in a manner that supports our internal controls, and we also maintain human resources policies and procedures designed to support our internal controls. Our risk assessments are designed to ensure the achievement of company-wide and process-level objectives as well as to identify and analyze risks while managing change. We believe that all of these components together form a foundation for sound internal control through directed leadership, shared values and a culture that emphasizes accountability for control.            As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Certifying Officers evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Certifying Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     The Certifying Officers have also concluded, based on our evaluation of our controls and procedures that as of June 30, 2016, our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective and provide a reasonable assurance of achieving their objective.     Due to the small size and limited financial resources, we have inadequate segregation of duties within accounting functions and results in an overall lack of internal control. As a result, there is little segregation of duties in the accounting function, leaving all aspects of financial reporting and physical control of cash in the hands of a few individuals. This limited segregation of duties represents a material weakness. We will continue periodically review our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and make modifications from time to time considered necessary or desirable.     Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that a restatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.     This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.             PART II       ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.      We are not presently involved in any litigation that is material to our business. We are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings. In addition, none of our officers, directors, promoters or control persons has filed or been involved for the past five years:                   in any bankruptcy petition                        in any conviction of a criminal proceeding or involved in a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and minor offenses)                        is subject to any order, judgment or decree enjoining, barring suspending or otherwise limiting their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activities,                        or has been found to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law.           We may be subject to, from time to time, various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company.
