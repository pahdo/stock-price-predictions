A. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Vertex" or the "Company") in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  
  The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of (i) the Company, (ii) its wholly-owned subsidiaries and (iii) consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs).  All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company operates in   one   segment, pharmaceuticals. 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company's annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted.  These interim financial statements, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year.  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on   February 16, 2016   (the "  2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K"). The Company has reclassified certain amounts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the period ended   December 31, 2015   between Accounts receivables, net and Prepaid expenses and other current assets to conform to the current year presentation.  
  Use of Estimates and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.  Significant estimates in these condensed consolidated financial statements have been made in connection with the calculation of revenues, inventories, research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, the fair value of intangible assets, goodwill, contingent consideration, noncontrolling interest, the consolidation of VIEs, leases, the fair value of cash flow hedges and the provision for or benefit from income taxes.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions, including in certain circumstances future projections that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. 
  The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note A, "Nature of Business and Accounting Policies," in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance applicable to revenue recognition that will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted for the year-ending December 31, 2017.  The new guidance applies a more principle based approach to recognizing revenue.  The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented or a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the new guidance and determining the expected effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance applicable to leases that will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  This update requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months on the balance sheet.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the new guidance and determining the expected effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance applicable to share-based compensation to employees that will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  This update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the new guidance and determining the expected effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows to reduce existing diversity in practice. The new accounting guidance is effective for the year ending December 31, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new guidance and determining the expected effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

For a discussion of other recent accounting pronouncements please refer to Note A,  Nature of Business and Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements,  in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that had a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
           B. 
    Product Revenues, Net  
     The Company sells its products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and selected regional wholesalers in North America as well as government-owned and supported customers in international markets (collectively, its  Customers ).  The Company's Customers in North America subsequently resell the products to patients and health care providers.  The Company recognizes net revenues from product sales upon delivery to the Customer as long as (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between the Company and the Customer, (ii) collectibility is reasonably assured and (iii) the price is fixed or determinable.  
  In order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, the Company must be able to (i) calculate its gross product revenues from sales to Customers and (ii) reasonably estimate its net product revenues upon delivery to its Customers' locations.  The Company calculates gross product revenues based on the price that the Company charges its Customers.  The Company estimates its net product revenues by deducting from its gross product revenues (a) trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and Customer fees, (b) estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks and discounts, (c) estimated reserves for expected product returns and (d) estimated costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives for certain indirect customers. 
  The Company makes significant estimates and judgments that materially affect the Company's recognition of net product revenues.  In certain instances, the Company may be unable to reasonably conclude that the price is fixed or determinable at the time of delivery, in which case it defers the recognition of revenues.  Once the Company is able to determine that the price is fixed or determinable, it recognizes the revenues associated with the units in which revenue recognition was deferred. 
  The following table summarizes activity in each of the product revenue allowance and reserve categories for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  :          

  In   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company sold ORKAMBI in France pursuant to early access programs.  The Company has not recognized any product revenues based on these sales because the price is not fixed or determinable due to the ongoing negotiations regarding the reimbursement rate for ORKAMBI in France.  If the negotiated reimbursement rate in France is lower than the price currently being paid by Customers in France under these programs, the Company would reimburse the difference between such prices to the Customers.  The cash received from sales in France is included as a liability on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet, and the increase in "other liabilities, current portion" from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016   is primarily due to this liability. 
   
           C. 
    Collaborative Arrangements 
     Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated 
  The Company has a research, development and commercialization agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ( CFFT ) that was originally entered into in May 2004, and was most recently amended on October 13, 2016 (the  2016 Amendment ).   Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, the Company has agreed to pay royalties ranging from low single digits to mid-single digits on potential sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between March 1, 2014 and August 31, 2016 and tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on any approved drugs first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before February 28, 2014, including KALYDECO (ivacaftor), ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor), lumacaftor and VX-661 (tezacaftor).  For combination products, such as ORKAMBI, sales will be allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the combination product consistent with the allocation of net sales for ORKAMBI since the Company began marketing ORKAMBI in mid-2015.   
  In each of the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, CFFT earned a commercial milestone payment of   $13.9 million   from the Company upon achievement of certain sales levels of lumacaftor.  There are   no   additional commercial milestone payments payable by the Company to CFFT pursuant to the agreement.  Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, the CFFT provided the Company an upfront program award of   $75.0 million   and agreed to provide development funding to the Company of up to   $6.0 million   annually.  
  The Company began marketing KALYDECO in the United States and certain countries in the European Union in 2012 and began marketing ORKAMBI in the United States in 2015. The Company received approval for ORKAMBI In the European Union in 2015 and in Canada and Australia in 2016.   The Company has royalty obligations to CFFT for ivacaftor, lumacaftor and VX-661 until the expiration of patents covering those compounds.   The Company has patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that expire in 2027 and 2025, respectively, subject to potential patent extensions.  The Company has patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of lumacaftor that expire in 2030 and 2026, respectively, subject to potential extension.  The Company has patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of VX-661 (tezacaftor) that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, subject to potential extension.

CRISPR Therapeutics AG 
  In October 2015, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement (the "CRISPR Agreement") with CRISPR Therapeutics AG and its affiliates ("CRISPR") to collaborate on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.  The Company has the exclusive right to license up to   six   CRISPR-Cas9-based targets.  In connection with the CRISPR Agreement, the Company made an upfront payment to CRISPR of   $75.0 million   and a   $30.0 million   investment in CRISPR pursuant to a convertible loan agreement that converted into preferred stock in January 2016. The Company expensed   $75.0 million   to research and development, and the   $30.0 million   investment was recorded at cost and is classified as a long-term asset on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company made an additional preferred stock investment in CRISPR of approximately   $3.1 million  .  In connection with CRISPR's initial public offering in October 2016, the Company made an additional   $10 million   common share investment in CRISPR and the Company's preferred stock investment in CRISPR converted into common shares. 
  The Company will fund all of the discovery activities conducted pursuant to the CRISPR Agreement.  For potential hemoglobinapathy treatments, including treatments for sickle cell disease, the Company and CRISPR will share equally all research and development costs and worldwide revenues.  For other targets that the Company elects to license, the Company would lead all development and global commercialization activities.  For each of up to   six   targets that the Company elects to license, other than hemoglobinapathy targets, CRISPR has the potential to receive up to   $420.0 million   in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties on net product sales.   
  The Company may terminate the CRISPR Agreement upon   90   days  notice to CRISPR prior to any product receiving marketing approval or upon   270   days  notice after a product has received marketing approval.  The CRISPR Agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the CRISPR Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the Company's payment obligations under the CRISPR Agreement. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  The Company has entered into several agreements pursuant to which it has licensed rights to certain drug candidates from third-party collaborators, which has resulted in the consolidation of the third parties' financial statements into the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements as VIEs.  In order to account for   the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments   related to these collaborations under GAAP, the Company uses present-value models based on assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the relevant milestones, estimates regarding the timing of achieving the milestones, estimates of future product sales and the appropriate discount rates.  The Company bases its estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant milestones on industry data for similar assets and its own experience.  The discount rates used in the valuation model represent a measure of credit risk and market risk associated with settling the liabilities.  Significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions at each reporting period.  Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments.  The following collaborations are reflected in the Company's financial statements as consolidated VIEs: 
    
  Parion Sciences, Inc. 
    
  License and Collaboration Agreement 
    
  In June 2015, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement (the "Parion Agreement") with Parion Sciences, Inc. ( Parion ).  Pursuant to the Parion Agreement, the Company is collaborating with Parion to develop investigational epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) inhibitors, including VX-371 (formerly P-1037) and VX-551 (formerly P-1055), for the potential treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and other pulmonary diseases.  The Company is leading development activities for VX-371 and VX-551 and is responsible for all costs, subject to certain exceptions, related to development and commercialization of the compounds. 
    
  Pursuant to the Parion Agreement, the Company has worldwide development and commercial rights to Parion s lead investigational ENaC inhibitors, VX-371 and VX-551, for the potential treatment of CF and all other pulmonary diseases and

     Table of Contents  
  VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  
  (unaudited) 

has the option to select additional compounds discovered in Parion s research program.  Parion received an   $80.0 million   up-front payment and has the potential to receive up to an additional (i)   $490.0 million   in development and regulatory milestone payments for development of ENaC inhibitors in CF, including   $360.0 million   related to global filing and approval milestones, (ii)   $370.0 million   in development and regulatory milestones for VX-371 and VX-551 in non-CF pulmonary indications and (iii)   $230.0 million   in development and regulatory milestones should the Company elect to develop an additional ENaC inhibitor from Parion s research program.  The Company has agreed to pay Parion tiered royalties that range from the low double digits to mid-teens as a percentage of potential sales of licensed products. 
    
  The Company may terminate the Parion Agreement upon   90   days  notice to Parion prior to any licensed product receiving marketing approval or upon   180   days  notice after a licensed product has received marketing approval.  If the Company experiences a change of control prior to the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for a licensed product, Parion may terminate the Parion Agreement upon   30   days  notice, subject to the Company's right to receive specified royalties on any subsequent commercialization of licensed products.  The Parion Agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions.  Unless earlier terminated, the Parion Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the Company's royalty obligations, which expire on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the date the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product expires or (ii)   ten   years after the first commercial sale in the country. 
    
  The Company determined that Parion is a VIE based on, among other factors, the significance to Parion of the ENaC inhibitors licensed to the Company pursuant to the Parion Agreement and on the Company's power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of Parion.  Accordingly, the Company consolidated Parion's financial statements beginning on June 4, 2015.  However, the Company's interests in Parion are limited to those accorded to the Company in the Parion Agreement.  
  Consideration for the Parion Agreement 
    
  The Company determined that the fair value of the consideration from the Company to Parion was   $255.3 million   as of June 4, 2015, which consisted of (i) an   $80.0 million   up-front payment, (ii) the estimated fair value of the contingent research and development milestones potentially payable by the Company to Parion and (iii) the estimated fair value of potential royalty payments payable by the Company to Parion.  The Company valued the contingent milestone and royalty payments using (a) discount rates ranging from   4.1%   to   5.9%   for the development milestones and (b) a discount rate of   6.6%   for royalties.  The consideration paid and the preliminary fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by the Company pursuant to the agreement are set forth in the table below: 

Allocation of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The Company allocated the total consideration to the assets and liabilities of Parion. The following table summarizes the final fair values of the assets and liabilities recorded on the effective date of the agreement:

The Company recorded   $255.3 million   of intangible assets on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet for Parion's in-process research and development assets.  These in-process research and development assets relate to Parion's pulmonary ENaC platform, including the intellectual property related to VX-371 and VX-551, that are licensed by Parion to the Company.  The Company recorded Parion s assets and liabilities including (i) the fair value of the intangible assets, (ii) the fair value of the net assets attributable to noncontrolling interest, and (iii) a deferred tax liability resulting from a basis difference in the intangible assets and certain other net liabilities held by Parion.  The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of Parion s net assets was recorded as goodwill. 
  BioAxone Biosciences, Inc. 
  In October 2014, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the  BioAxone Agreement ) with BioAxone Biosciences, Inc. ( BioAxone ), a privately-held biotechnology company, which resulted in the consolidation of  BioAxone as a VIE beginning on October 1, 2014.  The Company paid BioAxone initial payments of   $10.0 million   in the fourth quarter of 2014.  
  BioAxone has the potential to receive up to   $90.0 million   in milestones and fees, including development, regulatory and milestone payments and a license continuation fee.  In addition, BioAxone would receive royalties and commercial milestones on future net product sales of VX-210, if any. The Company recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of   $29.0 million   for VX-210 and a corresponding deferred tax liability of   $11.3 million   attributable to BioAxone.  The Company holds an option to purchase BioAxone at a predetermined price.  The option expires on the earliest of (a) the day the FDA accepts the Biologics License Application submission for VX-210, (b) the day the Company elects to continue the license instead of exercising the option to purchase BioAxone and (c) March 15, 2018, subject to the Company s option to extend this date by   one   year.  
  Aggregate VIE Financial Information 
    
  An aggregate summary of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the Company's VIEs for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

The increases in   the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were primarily due to a Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-371, a compound being developed pursuant to the Parion Agreement, achieving its primary safety endpoint in the second quarter of 2016.  The fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments also reflects changes in market interest rates and the time value of money.  During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the increase (decrease) in   the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments   related to the Company's VIEs was as follows:

As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to the Parion Agreement and the BioAxone Agreement was   $232.5 million   and   $28.8 million  , respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments related to the Parion collaboration and the BioAxone collaboration was   $179.0 million   and   $28.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  The following table summarizes items related to the Company's VIEs included in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of the dates set forth in the table: 

The Company has recorded the VIEs' cash and cash equivalents as restricted cash and cash equivalents (VIE) because (i) the Company does not have any interest in or control over the VIEs' cash and cash equivalents and (ii) the Company's agreements with each VIE do not provide for the VIEs' cash and cash equivalents to be used for the development of the assets that the Company licensed from the applicable VIE.  Assets recorded as a result of consolidating the Company's VIEs' financial condition into the Company's balance sheet do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company's general assets.  
  Other Collaborations 
  The Company has entered into various agreements pursuant to which it collaborates with third parties, including inlicensing and outlicensing arrangements.  Although the Company does not consider any of these arrangements to be material, the most notable of these arrangements are described below.

Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. 
  In July 2016, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement (the "Moderna Agreement") with Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. ("Moderna") pursuant to which the parties are seeking to identify and develop messenger Ribonucleic Acid ("mRNA") Therapeutics for the treatment of CF.  In connection with the Moderna Agreement in the third quarter of 2016, the Company made an upfront payment to Moderna of   $20.0 million   and a   $20.0 million   cost-method investment in Moderna pursuant to a convertible promissory note that converted into preferred stock in August 2016.  Moderna has the potential to receive future development and regulatory milestones of up to   $275.0 million  , including   $220.0 million   in approval and reimbursement milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales. 
  Under the terms of the Moderna Agreement, Moderna will lead discovery efforts and the Company will lead all preclinical, development and commercialization activities associated with the advancement of mRNA Therapeutics that result from this collaboration and will fund all expenses related to the collaboration. 
  The Company may terminate the Moderna Agreement by providing advanced notice to Moderna, with the required length of notice dependent on whether any product developed under the Moderna Agreement has received marketing approval.  The Moderna Agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the Moderna Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the Company's payment obligations under the Moderna Agreement. 
  Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  In June 2014, the Company entered into an agreement (the  Janssen Influenza Agreement ) with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Janssen Inc. ), which was amended in October 2014 to clarify certain roles and responsibilities of the parties.  
    
  Pursuant to the Janssen Influenza Agreement, Janssen Inc. has an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain drug candidates for the treatment of influenza, including VX-787.  The Company received non-refundable payments of   $35.0 million   from Janssen Inc. in 2014, which were recorded as collaborative revenue.  The Company has the potential to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales, if any.  Janssen Inc. may terminate the Janssen Influenza Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, upon   six   months' notice. 
  Janssen Inc. is responsible for costs related to the development and commercialization of the compounds.  During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded reimbursement for these development activities of   $2.8 million   and   $10.6 million  , respectively.  During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded reimbursement for these development activities of   $4.0 million   and   $18.7 million  , respectively. The reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to development expense in the Company's   condensed consolidated statements of operations   primarily due to the fact that Janssen Inc. directs the activities and selects the suppliers associated with these activities.

    Earnings Per Share 
     Basic net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding restricted stock and restricted stock units that have been issued but are not yet vested.  Diluted net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted-average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is dilutive.  
  The Company did not include the securities in the following table in the computation of the net loss per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders calculations because the effect would have been anti-dilutive during each period:

    Fair Value Measurements 
     The fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities reflects the Company s estimate of amounts that it would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from sources independent from the Company) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (the Company s assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).  The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: 
                 Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
      Level 2: 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs.  Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
      Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The Company s investment strategy is focused on capital preservation.  The Company invests in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in the Company s investment policy.  This policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or type of instrument.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s investments were primarily in money market funds, short-term government-sponsored enterprise securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company s financial assets that were subject to fair value measurements were valued using observable inputs.  The Company s financial assets valued based on Level 1 inputs consisted of money market funds and short-term government-sponsored enterprise securities.  The Company s financial assets valued based on Level 2 inputs consisted of corporate debt securities and commercial paper, which consisted of investments in highly-rated investment-grade corporations.

The Company's VIEs invested in cash equivalents consisting of money market funds of   $57.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which are valued based on Level 1 inputs.  These cash equivalents are not included in the table above.  The Company s noncontrolling interest related to VIEs includes   the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments  , which are valued based on Level 3 inputs.  Please refer to Note C,  Collaborative Arrangements,  for further information. 
  As of September 30, 2016  , the fair value and carrying value of the Company's Term Loan was   $297.8 million  .  The fair value of the Company's Term Loan was estimated based on Level 3 inputs computed using the effective interest rate of the Term Loan.  The effective interest rate considers the timing and amount of estimated future interest payments as well as current market rates.  Please refer to Note K, "Long-term Obligations" for further information regarding the Company's Term Loan.

    Hedging 
     The Company maintains a hedging program intended to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for a portion of the Company s forecasted product revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies.  The program includes foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP having contractual durations from   one   to   eighteen   months.  
  The Company formally documents the relationship between foreign currency forward contracts (hedging instruments) and forecasted product revenues (hedged items), as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities, which includes matching all foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the foreign currency forward contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items on a prospective and retrospective basis.  If the Company determines that a (i) foreign currency forward contract is not highly effective as a cash flow hedge, (ii) foreign currency forward contract has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or (iii) forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the Company would discontinue hedge accounting treatment prospectively.  The Company measures effectiveness based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and the fair value of the hypothetical foreign currency forward contracts with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all hedges were determined to be highly effective and the Company had not recorded any ineffectiveness related to the hedging program. 
  The following table summarizes the notional amount of the Company s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges:

I.   Inventories 
  Inventories consisted of the following: 

J.   Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
  Intangible Assets 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , in-process research and development intangible assets of   $284.3 million   were recorded on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
  In June 2015, in connection with entering into the Parion Agreement, the Company recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of   $255.3 million   based on the Company s estimate of the fair value of Parion s lead investigational ENaC inhibitors, including VX-371 and VX-551, that were licensed by the Company from Parion.  The Company aggregated the fair value of the ENaC inhibitors into a single intangible asset because the phase, nature and risks of development as well as the amount and timing of benefits associated with the assets were similar.  In October 2014, the Company recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of   $29.0 million   based on the Company s estimate of the fair value of VX-210, a drug candidate for patients with spinal cord injuries that was licensed by the Company from BioAxone.  The Company used discount rates of   7.1%   and   7.5%   in the present-value models to estimate the fair values of the ENaC inhibitors and VX-210 intangible assets, respectively.  
  Goodwill 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , goodwill of   $50.4 million   was recorded on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
   
  K.   Long-term Obligations 
  Fan Pier Leases 
  In 2011, the Company entered into   two   lease agreements, pursuant to which the Company leases approximately   1.1 million   square feet of office and laboratory space in   two   buildings (the  Buildings ) at Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts (the  Fan Pier Leases ).  The Company commenced lease payments in December 2013, and will make lease payments pursuant to the Fan Pier Leases through December 2028.  The Company has an option to extend the term of the Fan Pier Leases for an additional   ten years  .  
  Because the Company was involved in the construction project, the Company was deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Buildings during the construction period and recorded project construction costs incurred by the landlord. Upon completion of the Buildings, the Company evaluated the Fan Pier Leases and determined that the Fan Pier Leases did not meet the criteria for  sale-leaseback  treatment.  Accordingly, the Company began depreciating the asset and incurring interest expense related to the financing obligation in 2013.  The Company bifurcates its lease payments pursuant to the Fan Pier Leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the Buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the Buildings were constructed.  The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease that commenced in 2011. 
  Property and equipment, net, included   $492.3 million   and   $502.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to construction costs for the Buildings.  The carrying value of the Company's lease agreement liability for the Buildings was   $472.7 million   and   $473.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  San Diego Lease 
  On December 2, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 3215 Merryfield Row, San Diego, California with ARE-SD Region No. 23, LLC.  Pursuant to this agreement, the Company agreed to lease approximately   170,000   square feet of office and laboratory space in a building to be built in San Diego, California.  The lease will commence upon completion of the building, scheduled for the first half of 2018, and will extend for   16   years from the commencement date.  Pursuant to the lease agreement, during the initial   16  -year term, the Company will pay an average of approximately   $10.2 million   per year in aggregate rent, exclusive of operating expenses.  The Company has the option to extend the lease term for up to   two   additional   five  -year terms.

Term Loan 
  In July 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto, and Macquarie US Trading LLC ("Macquarie"), as administrative agent.  The credit agreement provided for a   $300.0 million   senior secured term loan ("Macquarie Loan").  On October 13, 2016, the Company terminated and repaid all outstanding obligations under the Macquarie Loan. 
  The Macquarie Loan initially bore interest at a rate of   7.2%   per annum, which was reduced to   6.2%   per annum based on the FDA's approval of ORKAMBI.  The Term Loan bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   5.0%   per annum during the third year of the term.   If the Company had not terminated and repaid all outstanding obligations, the maturity date of all loans under the facilities was July 9, 2017. 
  Based on the Company's evaluation of the Macquarie Loan, the Company determined that the Macquarie Loan contained several embedded derivatives.  These embedded derivatives were clearly and closely related to the host instrument because they related to the Company's credit risk; therefore, they did not require bifurcation from the host instrument, the Macquarie Loan. 
  The Company incurred   $5.3 million   in fees paid to Macquarie that were recorded as a discount on the Macquarie Loan and were recorded as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the loan in the Company s   condensed consolidated statements of operations  .    As of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unamortized discount associated with the Macquarie Loan that was included in the senior secured term loan caption on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet was   $2.1 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively. 
  Subsequent Event 
  On October 13, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders referred to therein.  The Credit Agreement provides for a   $500.0 million   revolving facility,   $300.0 million   of which was drawn at closing (the  Loans ).  The Credit Agreement also provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company may request that the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement be increased by an additional   $300.0 million  .  The Credit Agreement matures on October 13, 2021. 
  The proceeds of the borrowing under the Credit Agreement were used primarily to repay the Company's existing indebtedness under the Macquarie Loan.  The Company will incur a charge of   $2.2 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to a loss on extinguishment attributable to the Macquarie Loan.  The Loans will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a base rate or a Eurodollar rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. Under the Credit Agreement, the applicable margins on base rate loans range from   0.75%   to   1.50%   and the applicable margins on Eurodollar loans range from   1.75%   to   2.5%  , in each case based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of the Company's total consolidated debt to the Company's trailing twelve-month EBITDA). 
  The Loans are guaranteed by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Company's domestic subsidiaries (excluding intellectual property, owned and leased real property and certain other excluded property) and by the equity interests of the Company's subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.  Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company must maintain, subject to certain limited exceptions, a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and consolidated EBITDA of at least   $200.0 million  , in each case to be measured on a quarterly basis. 
  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.  In the case of a continuing event of default, the administrative agent would be entitled to exercise various remedies, including the acceleration of amounts due under outstanding loans. 
   
  L.   Stock-based Compensation Expense 
  During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized the following stock-based compensation expense:

M.   Other Arrangements 
  Sale of HIV Protease Inhibitor Royalty Stream 
  In 2008, the Company sold to a third party its rights to receive royalty payments from GlaxoSmithKline plc, net of royalty amounts to be earned by and due to a third party, for a one-time cash payment of   $160.0 million  .  These royalty payments relate to net sales of HIV protease inhibitors, which had been developed pursuant to a collaboration agreement between the Company and GlaxoSmithKline plc.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $15.8 million   in deferred revenues related to the one-time cash payment, which it is recognizing over the life of the collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc based on the units-of-revenue method.  In addition, the Company continues to recognize royalty revenues equal to the amount of the third-party subroyalty and an offsetting royalty expense for the third-party subroyalty payment. 
   
  N.   Income Taxes 
  The Company is subject to United States federal, state, and foreign income taxes.  For   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a   provision for income taxes   of   $0.5 million   and   $24.1 million  , respectively.  The provision for income taxes recorded in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   included a benefit of   $0.5 million   and a provision of   $20.1 million  , respectively, related to the Company's VIEs' income tax provision.  The Company has   no   liability for taxes payable by the Company's VIEs and the income tax provision and related liability have been allocated to noncontrolling interest (VIE).  For   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a   provision for income taxes   of   $1.3 million   and   $31.8 million  , respectively, primarily related to the Company's VIEs' income tax provision.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of   zero   and   $0.4 million  , respectively.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense.    As of September 30, 2016  ,   no   interest and penalties have been accrued.  The Company does not expect that its unrecognized tax benefits will materially increase within the next twelve months.  The Company did not recognize any material interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reduced the balance of its unrecognized tax benefits by approximately   $0.4 million   due to the expiration of statute of limitations, which reduced the Company s effective tax rate. 
  The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized because of its extended history of annual losses.   
  The Company files United States federal income tax returns and income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is no longer subject to any tax assessment from an income tax examination in the United States before 2011 or any other major taxing jurisdiction for years before 2009, except where the Company has net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that originated before 2009.  The Company currently is under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the year ended December 31, 2011 and in Delaware, Canada and Quebec for varying periods including the years ended December 31, 2011 through 2014.  No adjustments have been reported.  The Company is not under examination by any other jurisdictions for any tax year.  The Company concluded audits with Pennsylvania and Texas during 2016 and Massachusetts and New York during 2015 with no material adjustments. 
  The Company currently intends to reinvest the total amount of its unremitted earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , foreign earnings, which were not significant, have been retained indefinitely by foreign subsidiary companies for reinvestment; therefore, no provision has been made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of such earnings, and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.  Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to United States federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. 
   
  O.    Restructuring Liabilities 
  2003 Kendall Restructuring    
  In 2003, the Company adopted a plan to restructure its operations to coincide with its increasing internal emphasis on advancing drug candidates through clinical development to commercialization.  The restructuring liability relates to specialized laboratory and office space that is leased to the Company pursuant to a   15  -year lease that terminates in 2018.  The Company has not used more than   50%   of this space since it adopted the plan to restructure its operations in 2003.  This unused laboratory and office space currently is subleased to third parties.  
  The activities related to the restructuring liability for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Fan Pier Move Restructuring    
  In connection with the relocation of its Massachusetts operations to Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts, which commenced in 2013, the Company is incurring restructuring charges related to its remaining lease obligations at its facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The majority of these restructuring charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2014 upon decommissioning   three   facilities in Cambridge.  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company terminated   two   of these lease agreements resulting in a credit to restructuring expense equal to the difference between the Company s estimated future cash flows related to its lease obligations for these facilities and the termination payment paid to the Company s landlord on the effective date of the termination.  The third major facility included in this restructuring activity is   120,000   square feet of the   Kendall Square Facility   that the Company continued to use for its operations following its   2003 Kendall Restructuring  .  The rentable square footage in this portion of the   Kendall Square Facility   was subleased to a third party in February 2015.  The Company will continue to incur charges through April 2018 related to the difference between the Company s estimated future cash flows related to this portion of the   Kendall Square Facility  , which include an estimate for sublease income to be received

from the Company's sublessee and its actual cash flows.  The Company discounted the estimated cash flows related to this restructuring activity at a discount rate of   9%  .   
  The activities related to the restructuring liability for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Other Restructuring Activities 
  The Company has engaged in several other restructuring activities that are unrelated to its   2003 Kendall Restructuring   and the   Fan Pier Move Restructuring  .  The most significant activity commenced in October 2013 when the Company adopted a restructuring plan that included (i) a workforce reduction primarily related to the commercial support of INCIVEK following the continued and rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with INCIVEK as new medicines for the treatment of HCV infection neared approval and (ii) the write-off of certain assets.  This action resulted from the Company's decision to focus its investment on future opportunities in CF and other research and development programs. 
  The activities related to the Company's other restructuring liabilities for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

P.    Commitments and Contingencies 
  Financing Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had irrevocable stand-by letters of credit outstanding that were issued in connection with property leases and other similar agreements totaling   $21.9 million   that were cash collateralized.  The cash used to support these letters of credit is included in restricted cash, as of   September 30, 2016  , on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.  Effective as of October 13, 2016, the letters of credit are covered by the Company's credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders referred to therein, and as a result, are no longer cash collateralized.  
  Litigation 
  On May 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action   Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al.   was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors as defendants.  The lawsuit alleged that the Company made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in the Company's disclosures during the period from May 7, 2012 through May 29, 2012, all in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased the Company s common stock between May 7, 2012 and May 29, 2012.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys  fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants  sales of the Company s stock.  On October 8, 2014, the Court approved Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff, and Scott and Scott LLP as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class.  On February 23, 2015, the Company filed a reply to the plaintiffs  opposition to its motion to dismiss.  The court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on March 6, 2015 and took the motion under advisement.  On September 30, 2015, the court granted the Company's motion to dismiss.  On October 15, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal.  The First Circuit Court of Appeals issued a scheduling order on December 24, 2015. On February 2, 2016, the Plaintiff filed their opening brief and the Company filed its opposition brief on March 7, 2016.  On March 24, 2016, the plaintiff filed their reply brief.  Oral argument on the appeal took place on July 26, 2016.  On October 3, 2016, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court s dismissal of the Plaintiff s complaint.   As of September 30, 2016  , the Company has   no  t recorded any reserves for this purported class action. 
  Guaranties and Indemnifications 
  As permitted under Massachusetts law, the Company s Articles of Organization and By-laws provide that the Company will indemnify certain of its officers and directors for certain claims asserted against them in connection with their service as an officer or director.  The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited.  However, the Company has purchased directors  and officers  liability insurance policies that could reduce its monetary exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.    No   indemnification claims currently are outstanding, and the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. 
  The Company customarily agrees in the ordinary course of its business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trial investigators and sites in its drug development programs, sponsored research agreements with academic and not-for-profit institutions, various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for the Company and its real estate leases.  The Company also customarily agrees to certain indemnification provisions in its drug discovery, development and commercialization collaboration agreements.  With respect to the Company s clinical trials and sponsored research agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the investigator s institution relating to personal injury or property damage, violations of law or certain breaches of the Company s contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical testing of the Company s compounds or drug candidates.  With respect to lease agreements, the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury or property damage caused by the Company, to violations of law by the Company or to certain breaches of the Company s contractual obligations.  The indemnification provisions appearing in the Company s collaboration agreements are similar to those for the other agreements discussed above, but in addition provide some limited indemnification for its collaborator in the event of third-party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.

each of the cases above, the indemnification obligation generally survives the termination of the agreement for some extended period, although the Company believes the obligation typically has the most relevance during the contract term and for a short period of time thereafter.  The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited.  The Company has purchased insurance policies covering personal injury, property damage and general liability that reduce its exposure for indemnification and would enable it in many cases to recover all or a portion of any future amounts paid.  The Company has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions.  Accordingly, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. 
  Other Contingencies 
  The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities.  The Company accrues a reserve for contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.  There were   no   material contingent liabilities accrued as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  OVERVIEW 
  We are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases.  We use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets.  Our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications, while maintaining our financial strength.  Our two marketed products are ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. 
  Cystic Fibrosis  
  ORKAMBI  
  ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2015 and by the European Commission in November 2015, for the treatment of patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or   CFTR,   gene.  ORKAMBI was approved for this patient population in Canada and Australia in the first quarter of 2016.  In September 2016, the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  Our future ORKAMBI net product revenues in the United States will reflect the number of patients for whom treatment with ORKAMBI is initiated, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment, patient compliance with the recommended treatment regimen and the level of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments to our ORKAMBI gross product revenues.  We believe that there currently are approximately 11,000     patients in the United States who are eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI.  The country-by-country reimbursement approval process in ex-U.S. markets is ongoing.  We believe that there are approximately 12,000 patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in Europe and approximately an aggregate of 2,500 patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in Canada and Australia. 
  We have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in approximately 200 patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  We expect data from this clinical trial to be available by the end of 2016 and if successful, we expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency seeking approval of ORKAMBI in this patient population in the European Union in the first half of 2017.  We believe that there are approximately 3,400 patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in Europe. 
  We recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF two to five years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  The first part of the two-part clinical trial is evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics to inform dose selection for the second part of the clinical trial.  The primary endpoint of the second part of the clinical trial is safety and tolerability, with multiple efficacy measurements as secondary endpoints. 
  KALYDECO  
  KALYDECO (ivacaftor) was approved in 2012 in the United States and European Union as a treatment for patients with CF six years of age and older who have the G551D mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  Since 2012, we have increased the number of patients who are being treated with KALYDECO in the United States and ex-U.S. markets by expanding the label for KALYDECO to include patients with CF who have additional mutations in their   CFTR   gene and to include patients in additional age demographics.  We believe that there are approximately 4,000 patients in North America, Europe and Australia who are currently eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. 
  We have initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for ivacaftor in patients with CF less than two years of age to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on markers of CF disease in young children. The clinical trial utilizes a weight-based dose of ivacaftor granules that can be mixed in soft foods or liquids.  The clinical trial is enrolling patients with one of the ten   CFTR   gene mutations for which KALYDECO is currently approved. 
  VX-661 
  VX-661 (tezacaftor) is an orally-administered CFTR corrector drug candidate that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple CF patient populations who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  Details of the patient population and status of each of the ongoing clinical trials in this development program are as follows: 

24 

     Table of Contents  

Two copies of the F508del in their CFTR gene  :  We have completed enrollment in this clinical trial and expect data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of 2017.  
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in a gating defect in the CFTR protein  :  We plan to complete enrollment in this clinical trial in early 2017. 
                
    One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in residual CFTR function  :  We have completed enrollment in this clinical trial and expect data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of 2017. 
     If supported by data from the Phase 3 clinical program, Vertex plans to submit an NDA to the FDA for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we completed an interim futility analysis of efficacy data from the first part of a clinical trial in patients with one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function.  The analysis showed that the combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor did not result in a pre-specified improvement in lung function in this patient group. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB,  recommended that we stop the clinical trial and not initiate enrollment in the second part of this clinical trial. There were no safety concerns noted in the DSMB's review of the data. We are closing this clinical trial based on the recommendation of the DSMB. 
  In addition to evaluating the efficacy of the combination regimen, these Phase 3 clinical trials will provide safety data on the combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor to support the planned development of a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor. 
  ENaC Inhibition 
  VX-371 is an investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC, inhibitor, we are evaluating in a Phase 2 development program in collaboration with Parion Sciences, Inc., or Parion.  In the second quarter of 2016, Parion completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in approximately 142 patients with CF with no restriction on the mutations in their   CFTR   gene.  The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was safety as compared to patients on placebo.  Secondary endpoints evaluated the effect on mean absolute forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV   1    and patient-reported respiratory symptoms as reported in the CF questionnaire-revised, or CFQ-R.  The clinical trial met its primary safety endpoint and data from the clinical trial showed that VX-371 was generally well tolerated.  There were no statistically significant changes in FEV   1    or CFQ-R for patients who received VX-371. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating VX-371 in approximately 150 patients on ORKAMBI, both with and without the addition of hypertonic saline, who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.  The primary endpoints of this clinical trial are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in FEV   1    at day 28 as compared to patients on placebo. 
  In vitro  , VX-371 showed a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used in combination with ORKAMBI in human bronchial epithelial cells with two copies of the F508del mutation, but did not show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used alone. 
  Next-generation CFTR Corrector Compounds 
  We are developing next-generation CFTR corrector compounds that we plan to evaluate as part of triple combination treatment regimens.  We plan to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials of: 
             
    VX-440 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4-week dosing of VX-440 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in approximately 40 patients with CF who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function and approximately 25 patients with CF with two copies of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene; and 
                
    VX-152 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2-week dosing of VX-152 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in approximately 35 patients with CF who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function and approximately 25 patients with CF with two copies of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene.   
     Data from these clinical trials are expected in the second half of 2017 and if successful, are intended to support the potential initiation of Phase 3 development of VX-440 and a longer-duration Phase 2b or registrational program for VX-152. 
   We also plan to begin Phase 1 development of an additional next-generation corrector, VX-659, by the end of 2016.  The Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to enroll healthy volunteers and will also include an arm to evaluate triple combination dosing

in CF patients who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function.  If successful, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-659 in the second half of 2017. In addition to VX-659, we expect to move a fourth next-generation corrector from research into clinical development in 2017. 
  Research and Development 
  We are engaged in a number of other research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including in the areas of oncology, pain and neurology.   
  Oncology 
  We are conducting two Phase 1/2 clinical trials of VX-970, a protein kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related, or ATR, in combination with commonly used DNA-damaging chemotherapies across a range of solid tumor types, including triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We also are in Phase 1 development of VX-803, a second ATR inhibitor, alone and in combination with chemotherapy.  We have initiated Phase 1 clinical development of VX-984, a third oncology drug candidate, alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.   
  Pain 
  We are developing VX-150 and VX-241, two drug candidates for the treatment of pain.  We have initiated a six-week cross-over Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate VX-150 in approximately 100 patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee.  Data from this clinical trial is expected by the end of 2016.  
  Acute Spinal Cord Injury 
  We are developing VX-210, a drug candidate for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury, that we exclusively licensed from BioAxone BioSciences, Inc.  VX-210 is designed to inhibit a protein known as Rho that blocks neural regeneration after injury.  We have initiated a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-210 in patients with certain acute cervical spinal cord injuries. 
  Research 
  We plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines.  We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years.   
  Recent Transactions 
  CFFT 
  In October 2016, we amended our research, development and commercialization agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated, or CFFT.   Pursuant to the amendment, we have agreed to pay royalties ranging from low single digits to mid-single digits on certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between March 1, 2014 and August 31, 2016 and tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on any approved drugs first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before February 28, 2014, including KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, lumacaftor and VX-661.  In connection with the amendment, CFFT provided us an upfront program award of $75.0 million and agreed to provide development funding to us of up to $6.0 million annually. 
  Credit Agreement 
  In October 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders referred to therein. The agreement provides for a $500 million revolving facility, $300 million of which was drawn at closing. The agreement also provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under the agreement be increased by an additional $300 million.  All outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement mature on October 13, 2021.  In connection with entry into the agreement, we terminated and repaid all outstanding obligations under our pre-existing credit agreement with Macquarie US Trading LLC, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. 
  Moderna 
  In July 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., pursuant to which we are seeking to identify and develop messenger Ribonucleic Acid Therapeutics for the treatment of CF.  In  

26 

     Table of Contents  

connection with the agreement, we made an upfront payment to Moderna of $20.0 million and made a $20.0 million investment in Moderna pursuant to a convertible promissory note, that converted into preferred stock in August 2016. 
    
  Drug Discovery and Development 
  Discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take 10 to 15 years or more.  Potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product.  Most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval.  Because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential.  This process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors. 
  If we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an NDA to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the United States and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions.  To obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate.  The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval.  If regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed. 
  Regulatory Compliance 
  Our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations.  We have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, and through the promotion of a culture of compliance.  Among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various United States federal and state laws, and comparable foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims statutes, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses.  Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug.  False claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.  We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally. 
  Reimbursement 
  Sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations.  We dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the United States and ex-U.S. markets.  In the United States, we continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states.  Following the European Commission s November 2015 approval of ORKAMBI in Europe, we are working to obtain government reimbursement for ORKAMBI on a country-by-country basis, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments.  Consistent with our experience with KALYDECO when it was first approved, we expect reimbursement discussions in ex-U.S. markets may take a significant period of time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Loss Attributable to Vertex 
  Net   loss   attributable to Vertex was   $(38.8) million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to a net   loss   attributable to Vertex of   $(95.1) million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  Our revenues increased significantly in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due to increased ORKAMBI and KALYDECO net product revenues.  Our operating costs and expenses   increased   in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and cost of product revenues.  In the near term, we expect net loss (income) attributable to Vertex will be dependent on expected increases in ORKAMBI net product revenues.  
  Net   loss   attributable to Vertex was   $(145.0) million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to a net   loss   attributable to Vertex of   $(482.6) million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Our revenues increased significantly in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to increased ORKAMBI and KALYDECO net product revenues.  Our operating costs and expenses   increased   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and cost of product revenues.   Other items, net in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included an aggregate of   $58.5 million   in charges related to the increase in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to Parion. 
  Diluted Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Vertex Common Shareholders 
  Diluted net   loss   per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders was   $(0.16)   in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to a diluted net   loss   per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders of   $(0.39)   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . Diluted net   loss   per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders was   $(0.59)   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to a diluted net   loss   per share attributable to Vertex common shareholders of   $(2.00)   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Revenues 

Product Revenues, Net

     Table of Contents  

Our total net product revenues   increased   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to increased net product revenues from ORKAMBI, which was approved by the FDA in July 2015, and increased KALYDECO net product revenues.  In September 2016, the FDA approved a label expansion for ORKAMBI, expanding the label to include patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their   CFTR   gene. 
  We believe that the level of our ORKAMBI revenues for the remainder of 2016 will be dependent on: 
             
    the number of additional patients who begin treatment with ORKAMBI, including patients six to eleven years of age in the United States; 
        the rate at which additional patients initiate treatment; 
     the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment; and 
     the compliance rate for patients who remain on treatment. 
  We expect ORKAMBI net product revenues to increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2016.  In the short term, we expect that our ex-U.S. ORKAMBI net product revenues will be primarily from Germany due to the time it will take to complete the reimbursement discussions in other European countries.  In the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized approximately   $22.8 million   and   $47.5 million  , respectively, in ex-U.S. ORKAMBI net product revenues, which were mainly from Germany.  We also are selling ORKAMBI in France pursuant to an early access program, but are not recognizing any revenues because the price is not determinable.  
  The increase in KALYDECO net product revenues in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was primarily due to additional patients being treated with KALYDECO as we completed reimbursement discussions in various jurisdictions and to the increased number of patients eligible to receive KALYDECO through label expansions.  In the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized approximately   $75.1 million   and   $227.6 million  , respectively, in ex-U.S. KALYDECO net product revenues. 
  We have withdrawn INCIVEK from the market in the United States.  We may continue to have small adjustments to INCIVEK revenues over the next several quarters as we adjust our INCIVEK reserves for rebates, chargebacks and discounts.  
  Royalty Revenues 
  Our royalty revenues were   $3.8 million   and   $12.7 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $5.8 million   and   $17.6 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Our royalty revenues consist of (i) revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008 when we sold our rights to certain HIV royalties and (ii) revenues related to certain third-party royalties payable by our collaborators on sales of HIV and HCV drugs that also result in corresponding royalty expenses.  
  Collaborative Revenues 
  Our collaborative revenues were   $0.3 million   and   $1.0 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $1.5 million   and   $3.0 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Our collaborative revenues have historically fluctuated significantly from one period to another and may continue to fluctuate in the future.

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Product Revenues 
  Our cost of product revenues includes the cost of producing inventories that correspond to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of our products.  Pursuant to our agreement with CFFT, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens. Our cost of product revenues   increased   in the third quarter and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased net product revenues.  The increase in cost of product revenues in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   also reflected the second and final $13.9 million commercial milestone that was earned by CFFT in the first quarter of   2016   related to sales of ORKAMBI and that was included in cost of product revenues in the first quarter of 2016.  In future periods, our cost of product revenues will not be affected by commercial milestones on ORKAMBI, with our cost of product revenues generally tracking our net product revenues. 
  Royalty Expenses 
  Royalty expenses include expenses related to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of an HIV protease inhibitor sold by GlaxoSmithKline and third-party royalties payable upon net sales of telaprevir by our collaborators in their territories.  Royalty expenses do not include royalties we pay to CFFT on sales of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, which instead are included in cost of product revenues.  Royalty expenses in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $0.8 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, as compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of   decreased   INCIVO (telaprevir) sales by our collaborator Janssen NV. 
  Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates.  We do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs.  These internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program.  All research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred. 
  Since January 1, 2013, we have incurred   $3.5 billion   in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development.  The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks.  In addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the  

30 

     Table of Contents  

drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted.  The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures.  Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities.  Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict.  Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available. 
  In 2015 and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , costs related to our CF programs represented the largest portion of our development costs.  Any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change.  We cannot make a meaningful estimate when, if ever, our clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows. 
  Research Expenses 

We maintain a substantial investment in research activities.  Our research expenses   increased   by   43%   in the   third quarter   of 2016 as compared to the   third quarter   of 2015 and increased by   21%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Outsourced services and acquired research assets in the   third quarter   of 2016 included a $20.0 million upfront payment to Moderna for which there was no comparable expense in the   third quarter   of 2015.  We expect to continue to invest in our research programs with a focus on identifying drug candidates with the goal of creating transformative medicines. 
  Development Expenses 

Our development expenses in the   third quarter   of 2016 were consistent with development expenses in the   third quarter   of 2015.  Our development expenses   increased   by   $71.5 million  , or   15%  , in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in outsourced services during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related to ongoing clinical trials, including our Phase 3 development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, and an increase in infrastructure costs.

Sales, General and Administrative Expenses 

Sales, general and administrative expenses   increased   by   6%   in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   and   increased   by   15%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased investment in commercial support for ORKAMBI in ex-U.S. markets.  We expect sales, general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of 2016 will be similar to our quarterly sales, general and administrative expenses in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
     Restructuring Expense, Net 
  We recorded restructuring   expenses   of   $8.0 thousand   and   $1.0 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to restructuring   expenses   of   $1.8 million   and   $0.7 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Our restructuring expenses in the   third quarter   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily relate to adjustments to our restructuring liability in connection with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Boston, Massachusetts. 
  Other Items 
  Interest Expense, Net  
  Interest expense, net was   $20.1 million   and   $61.0 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to   $21.1 million   and   $63.6 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  During the remainder of 2016, we expect to incur approximately   $15 million   of interest expense associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters, approximately   $2 million   of interest expense related to the credit agreement we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016 and approximately  $2 million related to a loss on extinguishment attributable to the Macquarie Loan. 
  Other (Expense) Income, Net 
  Other (expense) income, net was an expense of   $0.2 million   and income of   $3.0 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to expense of   $1.3 million   and   $5.0 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Other (expense) income, net in each of the   third quarter   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily due to foreign exchange gains and losses. 
  Income Taxes 
  We recorded a   provision for income taxes   of   $0.5 million   and   $24.1 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to   $1.3 million   and   $31.8 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The provision for income taxes in the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 was due to income tax on our VIEs, as well as state and foreign tax in various jurisdictions. 
  Noncontrolling Interest (VIEs) 
  The net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest (VIEs) recorded on our condensed consolidated statements of operations reflects Parion and BioAxone's net loss (income) for the reporting period, adjusted for any changes during the reporting period in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by us to Parion and BioAxone. 
  In the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest (VIEs) was a loss of   $0.7 million   and income of   $33.2 million  , respectively.  In the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest (VIEs) was income of   $1.3 million   and a loss of   $30.9 million  , respectively.  
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

32 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of   $1.13 billion  , which represented an increase of   $86 million   from   $1.04 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we increased our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance due to increased cash receipts in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from product sales, partially offset by increased cash expenditures in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related to, among other things, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses.  
  Our future cash flows will be substantially dependent on product sales of KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.  
  Sources of Liquidity 
  We intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity.  We are receiving cash flows from sales of ORKAMBI and KALYDECO from the United States and ex-U.S. markets.  In the short term, we expect that our ex-U.S. ORKAMBI net product revenues will be primarily from Germany due to the time it will take to complete the reimbursement discussions in other European countries. 
  We borrowed $300.0 million under a $500.0 million revolving credit facility that we entered into in October 2016 and, subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million.  In 2014 and 2015, we also received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but we have received limited proceeds from employee benefit plans in 2016 and the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain.  Other possible sources of liquidity include strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, development milestones and royalties on sales of products, software and equipment leases, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions.  Negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity. 
  Future Capital Requirements 
  We incur substantial operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and to operate our organization. Under the terms of our credit agreement entered into in October 2016, we are required to repay the outstanding principal amount (currently $300.0 million) in 2021.  We also have substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in Boston, Massachusetts that continue through 2028.  In addition, we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets.   
  We expect that cash flows from KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.  The adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs. 
  Financing Strategy 
  In October 2016, we borrowed $300.0 million under a $500.0 million revolving credit facility that we entered into in October 2016.  In addition, subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million. In connection with this new credit agreement, we terminated and repaid all outstanding obligations under our pre-existing credit agreement.  We may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing.  We will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile.  There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 
   
  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS 
  Our commitments and obligations were reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on   February 16, 2016  .  There have been no

     Table of Contents  

material changes from the contractual commitments and obligations previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that: 
             
    On October 13, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders referred to therein. The agreement provides for a $500 million revolving facility, $300 million of which was drawn at closing.  All outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement mature on October 13, 2021.  In connection with entry into the agreement, we terminated and repaid all outstanding obligations under our pre-existing credit agreement with Macquarie US Trading LLC, as administrative agent, and the the other lenders party thereto. 
                
    On July 1, 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., or Moderna, pursuant to which Moderna is eligible to receive development and regulatory milestones of up to $275 million, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales. 
      
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.  These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.  Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on   February 16, 2016  .  
   
  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements please refer to Note A,  Nature of Business and Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements,  in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that had a material effect on our financial statements. 
   
  Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks.  The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations, including our research and development activities.  None of these market risk-sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes.   
  Interest Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally money market funds, short-term government-sponsored enterprise securities, U.S. Treasury securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper.  These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars.  All of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate.  Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity, and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of our investment instruments.  Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk. 

34 

Foreign Exchange Market Risk 
  As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. dollar.  The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, payables and inventories.  Both positive and negative affects to our net revenues from international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite affect that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating costs and expenses. 
  We maintain a foreign currency management program with the objective of reducing the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies.  
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of   September 30, 2016   our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II.  Other Information 
   
  Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
  Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al. 
  On May 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action   Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Plan   Trust v. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, et al.   was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming us and certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants.  The lawsuit alleged that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in our disclosures during the period from May 7, 2012 through May 29, 2012, all in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased our common stock between May 7, 2012 and May 29, 2012.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys  fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants  sales of our stock.  On October 8, 2014, the Court approved Local No. 8 IBEW Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff, and Scott and Scott LLP as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class.  We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on December 8, 2014 and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to our motion to dismiss on January 22, 2015.  On February 23, 2015, we filed a reply to the plaintiffs  opposition to our motion to dismiss.  The court heard oral argument on our motion to dismiss on March 6, 2015 and took the motion under advisement.  On September 30, 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss.  On October 15, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. The First Circuit Court of Appeals issued a scheduling order on December 24, 2015.  On February 2, 2016, the Plaintiff filed their opening brief and we filed our opposition brief on March 7, 2016.  On March 24, 2016, the plaintiff filed their reply brief.  Oral arguments on the appeal took place on July 26, 2016.  On October 3, 2016, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court s dismissal of the plaintiff s complaint.  
  DOJ Subpoena 
  In the third quarter of 2015, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to our marketed medicines.  This subpoena requests documents relating primarily to our Good Laboratory Practices in a bioanalytical laboratory.  We are in the process of responding to the subpoena and intend to continue to cooperate. 
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  Information regarding risk factors appears in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on February 16, 2016.  There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that: 
    
  Risk Relating to the Referendum of the United Kingdom s Membership of the European Union. 

35 

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, or the E.U., commonly referred to as  Brexit.   As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal from the E.U.  A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U.  In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. 
  The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business.  The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause third-party payors, including governmental organizations, to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets.  Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
  Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks. 
    
  In October 2016, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500 million revolving facility, $300 million of which was drawn at closing.  All outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement mature on October 13, 2021. 
  Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants, including that we maintain (i) subject to certain limited exceptions, a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) consolidated EBITDA of at least $200 million, in each case to be measured on a quarterly basis.  
  Further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates.  As a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. Failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
  Additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.  All obligations under the credit agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all guarantors (excluding intellectual property, owned and leased real property and certain other excluded property), including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries.  If we fail to satisfy our obligations under the credit agreement or are unable to obtain sufficient funds to make payments, the lenders could foreclose on our pledged collateral. 
    
  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.  Many factors mentioned in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be important in determining future results.  Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.  Actual future results may vary materially from expected results.  We also provide a cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties under  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on February 16, 2016.  These are factors and uncertainties that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results.  Other factors and uncertainties besides those listed there could also adversely affect us. 
  Without limiting the foregoing, the words  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   intends,   expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  There are a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control.  In addition, the forward-looking statements contained herein represent our estimate only as of the date of this filing and should not be relied upon as representing our estimate as of any subsequent date.  While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.

  (iii)        No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:

  51 

or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; 
  (F)        the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or

  (v)        No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.

   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  52 

C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be.  In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer:  (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof and in the absence of specification of currency shall be deemed a request for a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may reasonably require.  In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may require.  Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the applicable L/C Issuer such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as such L/C Issuer may require. 
  (ii)        Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.  Unless the applicable L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
  (iii)        Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

  53 

(iv)        If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a standby Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an    Auto-Extension Letter of Credit      provided   that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve (12) month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the    Non-Extension Notice Date   ) in each such twelve (12) month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;   provided     that  , a Letter of Credit may, upon the request of the Borrower, be renewed for a period beyond the Letter of Credit Expiration Date subject to the provisions of   Section 2.03(a)(ii)(B)  ;   provided  ,   however  , that such L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
  (c)        Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations  . 
  (i)        Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  The Borrower shall reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for all drawings under any Letter of Credit in Dollars, unless, in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, (A) such L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in such Alternative Currency, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in such Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall have notified such L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower will reimburse such L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency.  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.  If the Borrower shall have received notice from the applicable L/C Issuer on or prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of payment by the  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  54 

applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, not later than 4:00 p.m. on such date of payment by the applicable L/C Issuer, or, if the Borrower shall have received notice later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m. on the immediately following Business Day, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by such L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an    Honor Date   ), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency.  In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify any L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing.  If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the    Unreimbursed Amount   ), and the amount of such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof.  In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice).  Any notice given by any L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;   provided   that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
  (ii)        Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer, in Dollars,     at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable L/C Issuer in Dollars. 
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  55 

(iii)        With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section. 
  (iv)        Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer. 
  (v)        Each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuers for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any L/C Issuer, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided  ,   however  , that each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse any L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
  (vi)        If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  56 

included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.  A certificate of any L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Repayment of Participations  . 
  (i)        At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
  (ii)        If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)        Obligations Absolute  .  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse each L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
  (i)        any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
  (ii)        the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or by such Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated hereby or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  57 

(iii)        any draft, demand, endorsement, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
  (iv)        waiver by any L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer s protection and not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by such L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower; 
  (v)        honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; 
  (vi)        any payment made by any L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under, such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable; 
  (vii)        any payment by any L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
  (viii)        any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or  
  (ix)        any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; 
  provided   that the foregoing shall not excuse any L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent provided in the second proviso to   Section 2.03(f)  . 
  The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer.  The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
  (f)        Role of L/C Issuer  .  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility

  58 

to obtain any document (other than any sight or time draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.  The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;   provided  ,   however  , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.03(e);   provided  ,   however  , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against any L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves, as determined by a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, were caused by such L/C Issuer s gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith or such L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight or time draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, any L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring, endorsing or assigning or purporting to transfer, endorse or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no L/C Issuer shall be responsible to the Borrower for, and no L/C Issuer s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall be impaired by, any action or inaction of such L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as

applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law   Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 
  (h)        Letter of Credit Fees  .  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance, subject to Section 2.15, with its Applicable Revolving Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the    Letter of Credit Fee   ) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.

Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on or prior to the date that is ten (10) Business Days following each fiscal quarter end, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 
  (j)        Conflict with Issuer Documents  .  In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 
  (k)        L/C Issuer Reports to the Administrative Agent  .  Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer shall, in addition to its notification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section, provide the Administrative Agent a Letter of Credit Report, as set forth below: 
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  60 

(i)        reasonably prior to the time that such L/C Issuer issues, amends, renews, increases or extends a Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal, increase or extension and the stated amount of the applicable Letters of Credit after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed); 
  (ii)        on each Business Day on which such L/C Issuer makes a payment pursuant to a Letter of Credit, the date and amount of such payment; 
  (iii)        on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse a payment made pursuant to a Letter of Credit required to be reimbursed to such L/C Issuer on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such payment; 
  (iv)        on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer; and 
  (v)        for so long as any Letter of Credit issued by an L/C Issuer is outstanding, such L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (A) on the last Business Day of each calendar month, (B) at all other times a Letter of Credit Report is required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (C) on each date that (1) an L/C Credit Extension occurs or (2) there is any expiration, cancellation and/or disbursement, in each case, with respect to any such Letter of Credit, a Letter of Credit Report appropriately completed with the information for every outstanding Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer. 
  (l)        Additional L/C Issuers  .  Any Lender hereunder (that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) may become an L/C Issuer upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of a fully executed Notice of Additional L/C Issuer which shall be signed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each L/C Issuer. 
  (m)        Letters of Credit Issued for Restricted Subsidiaries  .  Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse each L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under each Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Borrower inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Restricted Subsidiaries. 
   (a)        The Swingline  .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section, may in its sole discretion make loans to the Borrower (each such loan, a    Swingline Loan   ).  Each such Swingline Loan may be made, subject to the terms and conditions set  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  61 

forth herein, to the Borrower, in Dollars, from time to time on any Business Day.  During the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swingline Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swingline Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Revolving Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swingline Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender s Revolving Commitment;   provided  ,   however  , that (i) after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments at such time, and (B) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender at such time shall not exceed such Lender s Revolving Commitment, (ii) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan, and (iii) the Swingline Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swingline Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section.  Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest only at a rate based on the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.  Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan. 
  (b)        Borrowing Procedures  . 
  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Swingline Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by: (A) telephone or (B) a Swingline Loan Notice;   provided   that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swingline Loan Notice.  Each such Swingline Loan Notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day).  Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.  Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the third sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender may, make the  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  62 

amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Borrower at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swingline Lender in Same Day Funds. 
  (c)        Refinancing of Swingline Loans  . 
  (i)        The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.  The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. 
  (ii)        If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
  (iii)        If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  63 

charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (iv)        Each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided     however  , that each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice).  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
  (d)        Repayment of Participations  . 
  (i)        At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender. 
  (ii)        If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)        Interest for Account of Swingline Lender  .  The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans.  Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section to refinance such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of any Swingline  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  64 

Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Revolving Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender. 
  (f)        Payments Directly to Swingline Lender  .  The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender. 
   (a)        Optional  . 
  (i)        The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty subject to Section 3.05;   provided   that, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, (A) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (1) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender s Applicable Percentage).  If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  Subject to Section 2.15, such prepayments shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 
  (ii)        The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swingline Lender pursuant to delivery to the Swingline Lender of a Notice of Loan Prepayment (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swingline Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;   provided   that, unless otherwise agreed by the Swingline Lender, (A) such notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess hereof (or, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding).  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  65 

notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. 
  (b)        Mandatory  . 
  (i)        If for any reason the Total Revolving Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment then in effect for the Revolving Facility at such time, the Borrower shall promptly (and in any event, within one (1) Business Day) prepay Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and L/C Borrowings (together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon) and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;   provided  ,   however  , that the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i) unless, after the prepayment of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment then in effect for the Revolving Facility at such time;   provided   that if any such excess shall result solely from a change in the applicable exchange rates relating to Alternative Currencies, then such prepayment and/or Cash Collateralization shall only be required to be made by the Borrower upon three (3) Business Days  notice from the Administrative Agent. 
  (ii)        Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15, prepayments of the Revolving Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.05(b),   first  , shall be applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings and the Swingline Loans,   second  , shall be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans, and,   third  , shall be used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C Obligations.  Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral shall be applied (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Defaulting Lender that has provided Cash Collateral) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer or the Revolving Lenders, as applicable. 
  (iii)        If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal to 105%  of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect. 
  Within the parameters of the applications set forth above in Section 2.05(b), prepayments pursuant to Section 2.05(b) shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities.  All prepayments under Section 2.05(b) shall be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

  (b)        Mandatory  .    If after giving effect to any reduction or termination of Revolving Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Commitments at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit, as the case may be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. 
  (c)        Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees  .  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, Swingline Sublimit or the Revolving Commitment under this Section 2.06.  Upon any reduction of the Revolving Commitments, the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender shall be reduced by such Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such reduction amount.  All fees in respect of the Revolving Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
   (a)        Revolving Loans  .  The Borrower shall repay to the Revolving Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

  67 

understood that the Borrower may use the proceeds of a Borrowing of Revolving Loans for such repayment, subject to the applicable conditions to such Borrowing hereunder) and (ii) the Maturity Date. 
   (a)        Interest  .  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan under the Revolving Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period   plus   the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan under the Revolving Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Rate.

  68 

(a)        Commitment Fee  .  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Percentage, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Revolving Facility exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.15.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the Revolving Facility for purposes of determining the commitment fee.  The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period for the Revolving Facility.  For purposes of calculating the commitment fee, if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
  (b)        Other Fees  .

           2.10 
    Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate  . 
     (a)        Computation of Interest and Fees  .  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365 day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  (b)        Financial Statement Adjustments or Restatements  .  If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or for any other reason, the Borrower, or the Lenders determine that (i) the

Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under any provision of this Agreement to payment of any Obligations hereunder at the Default Rate or under Article VIII.  The Borrower s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.  Any additional interest or fees under this Section 2.10(b) shall not be due and payable until a demand is made for such payment by the Administrative Agent and accordingly, any nonpayment of such interest or fees as a result of any such inaccuracy shall not constitute a Default (whether retroactively or otherwise), and none of such additional amounts shall be deemed overdue or accrue interest at the Default Rate. 
   (a)        Maintenance of Accounts  .  The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Revolving Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Revolving Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
  (b)        Maintenance of Records  .  In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  70 

and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
           2.12 
    Payments Generally; Administrative Agent s Clawback  . 
     (a)        General  .  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent, in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  Subject to Section 2.07(a) and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
  (b)        (i)      Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  71 

paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
  (ii)        Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
  (c)        Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent  .  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
  (d)        Obligations of Lenders Several  .  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c). 
  (e)        Funding Source  .  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
  (f)        Pro Rata Treatment  .  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:  (i) each Borrowing (other than Swingline Borrowings) shall be made from the Appropriate Lenders,  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  72 

each payment of fees under Section 2.09 and Sections 2.03(h) and (i) shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the respective Revolving Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Revolving Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Revolving Commitments (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Appropriate Lenders. 
   If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of the Revolving Facility due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Revolving Facility due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Revolving Facility due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Revolving Facility owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Revolving Facility owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Revolving Facility owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then, in each case under clauses (a) and (b) above, the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Revolving Facility then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be,   provided   that: 
  (1)        if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  73 

(2)        the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.14, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 
   (a)        Certain Credit Support Events  .  If (i) any L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05 or 8.02(c), or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one (1) Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by the Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. 
  (b)        Grant of Security Interest  .  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.14(c).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will,  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  74 

promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more blocked, interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America (it being understood and agreed that Bank of America and the Administrative Agent make no warranty or guarantee as to the level of, or amount (if any) of, interest with respect to such deposit account).  The Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral. 
  (c)        Application  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.14 or Sections 2.03, 2.05, 2.15 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Revolving Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 
  (d)        Release  .  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Revolving Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 11.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral;   provided  ,   however  , (A) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents, and (B) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
  (e)        Release of Lenders  Obligations  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, in the event that (i) any applicable L/C Issuer shall have issued, in accordance with Section 2.03(a)(ii)(B), a Letter of Credit with an expiry date occurring after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and (ii) the Borrower shall have Cash Collateralized the Outstanding Amount of all such L/C Obligations in respect of such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.14(a) above, then, upon the provision of such Cash Collateral and without any further action, each Lender hereunder shall be automatically released from any further obligation to such L/C Issuer in respect of such Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, any obligation of any such Lender to reimburse such L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under such Letter of Credit or to purchase any risk participation therein;   provided  ,   however  , that all such obligations of each Lender hereunder to such L/C Issuer in respect of such Letter of Credit shall be revived if any Cash Collateral provided by the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  75 

entered into by the Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such Cash Collateral had not been provided.  The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph shall survive the Facility Termination Date.  
   (a)        Adjustments  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
  (i)        Waivers and Amendments  .  Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of  Required Lenders  and Section 11.01. 
  (ii)        Defaulting Lender Waterfall  .  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:    first  , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;   second  , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder;   third  , to Cash Collateralize each L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.14;   fourth  , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;   fifth  , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (A) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (B) Cash Collateralize each L/C Issuer s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.14;   sixth  , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   seventh  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   eighth  , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise as may be required under the Loan Documents in connection with any Lien conferred  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  76 

thereunder or directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided     that if (1) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (2) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv).  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  (iii)        Certain Fees  . 
  (A)        Fees  .  No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
  (B)        Letter of Credit Fees  .  Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14. 
  (C)        Defaulting Lender Fees  . With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) or any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (2) pay to each L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer s or Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
  (iv)        Reallocation of Applicable Revolving Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Percentages  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  77 

(calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Revolving Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Commitment.  Subject to Section 11.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  (v)        Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans  .  If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (A) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure and (B) second, Cash Collateralize each L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.14. 
  (b)        Defaulting Lender Cure  .  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and the L/C Issuers agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and   provided  ,   further  , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
           2.16 
    Increase in Revolving Commitments  . 
     (a)        Increase in Revolving Facility  . 
  (i)        Upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Revolving Lenders), the Borrower may from time to time after the Closing Date, request an increase in the Revolving Facility by an aggregate amount (for all such requests) not to exceed $300,000,000 (any such increase in the Revolving Facility, an    Incremental Revolving Facility      provided   that (i) any such request for an Incremental Revolving Facility shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000, and in increments of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, or, if less, the entire remaining amount available for such Incremental Revolving Facility, and (ii) in no event shall the  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  78 

Aggregate Revolving Commitments under the Revolving Facility (after giving effect to all requested increases therein) exceed $800,000,000.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may seek commitments from existing Lenders or any other Person that is an Eligible Assignee who shall become a Revolving Lender in connection therewith.  At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Revolving Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Revolving Lenders). 
  (ii)        Revolving Lender Elections to Increase  .  Each Revolving Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Revolving Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase.  Any Revolving Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Commitment. 
  (iii)        Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Revolving Lenders  .  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Revolving Lender of the Revolving Lenders  responses to each request made hereunder.  To achieve the full amount of a requested increase (to the extent the existing Revolving Lenders do not agree to provide the entire amount of the requested increase), and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Swingline Lender, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Revolving Lenders (together with any existing Revolving Lender participating in such increase, each, an    Increasing Revolving Lender   ) pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.  Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Revolving Lender to participate in any increase in the Revolving Facility. 
  (iv)        Effective Date and Allocations  .  If the Revolving Facility is increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine (x) the effective date of any such increase (the    Revolving Facility Increase Effective Date   ) and (y) the final allocation of such increase among the Increasing Revolving Lenders and   Schedule 1.01(b)   attached hereto shall be automatically updated to reflect the same.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Revolving Facility Increase Effective Date. 
  (b)        Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase  .  As a condition precedent to each such increase in the Revolving Facility pursuant to this Section 2.16: 
  (i)        as of the Revolving Increase Effective Date, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) no Default or Event of Default shall then exist or would exist after giving effect thereto exists, (B) the Borrower shall demonstrate to the

  (iii)        If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each of the Loan Parties shall also, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or an L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below.

  (d)        Evidence of Payments  .  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

  (A)        any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

  (1)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable)  establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 
  (2)        executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
  (3)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit K-1   to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a    U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate   ) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or

  (C)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  84 

of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (or originals, as required) of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (D)        if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  (iii)        Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  (f)        Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Loan  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  85 

Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. 
  (g)        Survival  .  Each party s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the termination of the Revolving Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
   (a)        If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans  the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  86 

upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
  (b)        If, in any applicable jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer to (i) perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (ii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any Credit Extension such Person shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, then, upon the Administrative Agent notifying the Borrower, and until such notice by such Person is revoked, any obligation of such Person to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Loan Parties shall, (A) repay that Person s applicable Obligations on the date specified by such Person in the notice delivered to the Administrative Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by applicable Law) and (B) take all reasonable actions requested by such Person to mitigate or avoid such illegality. 
   (a)        If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i)  the Administrative Agent determines that (A)  Dollar deposits  are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to clause (i),    Impacted Loans   ), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  87 

such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
  (b)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this Section, the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower and the Required Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) of this Section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
           3.04 
    Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans  . 
     (a)        Increased Costs Generally  .  If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(d)) or any L/C Issuer; 
  (ii)        subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
  (iii)        impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  88 

may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)        Capital Requirements  .  If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)        Certificates for Reimbursement  .  A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
  (d)        Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans  .  The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as  Eurocurrency liabilities ), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Revolving Commitments or the funding of the Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Revolving Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least ten (10) days  prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice.

  89 

(e)        Delay in Requests  .  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
   Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and manner of, calculating such compensation, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
  (a)        any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
  (b)        any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower;  
  (c)        any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.13; or 
  (d)        any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency 
  including any loss or expense (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits).  The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this   Section 3.05  , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

   The properties of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies not Affiliates of the Borrower, in such amounts (after giving effect to any self-insurance compatible with the following standards), with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily carried by companies of a similar size engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties.

To the best knowledge of the Loan Parties, nothing has occurred that would prevent or cause the loss of such tax-qualified status other than qualification defects that can be corrected under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System described in IRS Revenue Procedures 2013-12, 2015-27 and 2015-18 where such correction would not be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
  (b)        There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Loan Parties, threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority, with respect to any Plan that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  There has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Secured Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.  Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received from such Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Loan Parties to preserve the allocation to Secured Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Secured Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received a Secured Party Designation Notice, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term  agent  herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
  (b)        Collateral Agent  . The Administrative Agent shall also act as the  collateral agent  under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Hedge Bank and a potential Cash Management Bank) and each of the L/C Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and such L/C Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.  In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as  collateral agent  and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX and Article XI (including Section 11.04(c), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the  collateral agent  under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
   The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial, advisory, underwriting or other business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or to provide notice to or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto.

  (c)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary), or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objections.

  The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations (including accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Secured Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, or any similar Laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable Law.  In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Secured Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase).  In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Equity Interests thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in clauses (a) through (j) of Section 11.01 of this Agreement, and (iii) to the extent that Secured Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Secured Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Secured Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Secured Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action.

  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.10.  In each case as specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will promptly, at the Borrower s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.10.  The Administrative Agent shall have no liability whatsoever to any Secured Party as the result of effectuating or executing any document evidencing any release of Collateral or Loan Party by it as permitted (or which the Administrative Agent in good faith believes to be permitted) by this   Section 9.10   and any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this   Section 9.10   shall be without recourse or warranty by the Administrative Agent. 
  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.

The Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Secured Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements in the case of a Facility Termination Date.  Each Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees (including on behalf of any of its Affiliates that may be a Cash Management Bank or a potential Hedge Bank) that (x) obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any Secured Cash Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement shall be secured and guaranteed pursuant to the Collateral Documents to the extent that, and for so long as, the other Obligations are so secured and guaranteed and (y) any release of Collateral or Guarantors effected in a manner permitted by this Agreement shall not require the consent of holders of obligations under Secured Cash Management Agreements or Secured Hedge Agreements. 
  ARTICLE X            CONTINUING GUARANTY 
   Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally, jointly and severally guarantees, as primary obligor and as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all Secured Obligations (for each Guarantor, subject to the proviso in this sentence, its    Guaranteed Obligations      provided   that (a) the Guaranteed Obligations of a Guarantor shall exclude any Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to such Guarantor and (b) the liability of each Guarantor individually with respect to this Guaranty shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law or other applicable Law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guaranteed Obligations shall include any such indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities with respect to Secured Obligations, or portion thereof, which may be or hereafter become unenforceable or compromised or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against any Debtor under any Debtor Relief Laws.  The Administrative Agent s books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Secured Obligations absent manifest error.  This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Secured Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Secured

Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Secured Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantors, or any of them, under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 
   Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Secured Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Secured Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Secured Obligations.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor. 
   Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Secured Party) of the liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting any Guarantor s liability hereunder; (d) any right to proceed against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Secured Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Secured Party whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Secured Party; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable Law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.  Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Secured Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Secured Obligations. 
   The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Secured Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.

No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Secured Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Revolving Commitments and the Revolving Facility are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to a Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Secured Parties to reduce the amount of the Secured Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 
   This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Secured Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or a Guarantor is made, or any of the Secured Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Secured Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Secured Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Secured Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 
   If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Secured Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against a Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor, jointly and severally, immediately upon demand by the Secured Parties. 
   Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Secured Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Secured Parties at any time, to disclose to it any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other guarantor (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Secured Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).

Each of the Loan Parties hereby appoints the Borrower to act as its agent for all purposes of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and all other documents and electronic platforms entered into in connection herewith and agrees that (a) the Borrower may execute such documents and provide such authorizations on behalf of such Loan Parties as the Borrower deems appropriate in its sole discretion and each Loan Party shall be obligated by all of the terms of any such document and/or authorization executed on its behalf, (b) any notice or communication delivered by the Administrative Agent, an L/C Issuer or a Lender to the Borrower shall be deemed delivered to each Loan Party and (c) the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers or the Lenders may accept, and be permitted to rely on, any document, authorization, instrument or agreement executed by the Borrower on behalf of each of the Loan Parties. 
   The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other Guarantors as permitted under applicable Law. 
   Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Guaranty or the grant of a Lien under the Loan Documents, in each case, by any Specified Loan Party becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor s obligations and undertakings under this Article X voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.  Each Loan Party intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
  ARTICLE XI            MISCELLANEOUS

  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section;   provided   that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 11.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender;   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder;   provided  ,   however  , that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  165 

publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (2) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.  For purposes of this Section,    Information    means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Revolving Commitments. 
  (b)        Non-Public Information  .  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (i) the Information may include material non-public information concerning a Loan Party or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States federal and state securities Laws. 
  (c)        Press Releases  .  The Loan Parties and their Affiliates agree that they will not in the future issue any press releases or other public disclosure using the name of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, unless (and only to the extent that) the Loan Parties or such Affiliate is required to do so under law and then, in any event the Loan Parties or such Affiliate will consult with such Person before issuing such press release or other public disclosure. 
   If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, such L/C Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  166 

the Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured, secured or unsecured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;   provided   that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Secured Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11.08, if at any time any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates maintains one or more deposit accounts for the Borrower or any other Loan Party into which Medicare and/or Medicaid receivables are deposited, such Person shall waive the right of setoff set forth herein. 
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the    Maximum Rate   ).  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 
           11.10 
    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness  . 
     This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement,  the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the  
  
   DB1/ 88815292.10 
    
  167 

signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any certificate delivered thereunder, by fax transmission or e-mail transmission (e.g.  pdf  or  tif ) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or certificate.  Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent a manually executed counterpart is not specifically required to be delivered under the terms of any Loan Document, upon the request of any party, such fax transmission or e-mail transmission shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. 
           11.11 
    Survival of Representations and Warranties  . 
     All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
   If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
   If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such

  (b)        such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (c)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
  (d)        such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
  (e)        in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Loan Party (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

  CERTIFICATION 
  I, Jeffrey M. Leiden, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
