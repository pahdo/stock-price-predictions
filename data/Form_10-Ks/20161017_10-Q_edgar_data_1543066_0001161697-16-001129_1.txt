  Note 1. Presentation and Nature of Operations  
   
 Throughout this report, the terms  our,   we,   us,  and the  Company  refer to E-Waste Corp. and its consolidated subsidiary, Peekay Boutiques Inc.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of E-Waste Corp. have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements, instructions to Form 10-Q, and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016 filed with the SEC on June 15, 2016 ( Annual Report ).  In management s opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation to make our financial statements not misleading have been included.  The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The February 29, 2016 balance sheet has been derived from our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report. 
   
 E-Waste Corp. was organized in the State of Florida on January 26, 2012, to develop an e-waste recycling business.  The Company was not successful in its efforts and discontinued this line of business.  Since that time, the Company has been a  shell company  (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). 
   
 Going forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. 
   
 On November 18, 2014, we formed our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Peekay Boutiques Inc., solely in connection with a potential business combination for which we determined not to proceed.  Peekay Boutiques Inc. has no business or operations. 
   
  Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which contemplates our continuation as a going concern.   We have not yet generated any revenue and have incurred losses to date of $276,457.  In addition, our current liabilities exceed our current assets by $232,692.  To date we have funded our operations through advances from a stockholder and the sale of common stock.  We intend on financing our future development activities and our working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern.  Our ability to continue our operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon our ability to raise capital sufficient to fund commitments, ongoing losses, and ultimately generate profitable operations. 
   
  Basis of Consolidation  
   
 The consolidated condensed financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiary Peekay Boutiques Inc. All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.

  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  
  August 31, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  Financial Instruments  
   
 Our balance sheet includes certain financial instruments.  The carrying amounts of current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. 
   
  Revenue and Cost Recognition  
   
 We currently have no source of revenue; therefore, we have not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 A provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ).  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
   
 ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.  Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 
   
 For the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 
   
  Earnings per Share  
   
 We calculate net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share .  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed by including Common Stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator.  At August 31, 2016 and 2015 we had no potential dilutive common shares and, any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended. 
   
  Recent Pronouncements  
   
 We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoptions of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of operations. 
   
  Note 3. Stockholder Advances - Related Party  
   
 Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if we have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.  Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 
   
 During the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 we received $37,075 in advances from a shareholder of the Company.  As of August 31, 2016, the balance of the advances was $222,978.  The advances bear no interest, are unsecured and are due on demand.

  Note 4. Stockholders  Equity  
   
 During the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 there were no issuances or cancellations of our common stock. 
   
 There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company. 
   
  Note 5. Income Taxes  
   
 We have determined an estimated annual effective tax rate.  The rate will be revised, if necessary, as of the end of each successive interim period during our fiscal year to our best current estimate. 
   
 There are open statutes of limitations for taxing authorities in federal and state jurisdictions to audit our tax returns from 2013 through the current period.  Our policy is to account for income tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense in the statements of operations.  There have been no income tax related interest or penalties assessed or recorded. 
   
 ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  This pronouncement also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.  There have been no uncertain tax positions taken. 
   
  Note 6. Commitments and Contingency  
   
 From time to time the Company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company.  Management believes that there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
   
  Note 7. Business Segments  
   
 There are no reportable business segments. 
   
  Note 8. Subsequent Events  
   
 Management has evaluated all activity and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred as of October 17, 2016 that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   
  Forward-Looking Statements  
   
  Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses.  Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words  expects,   anticipates,   intends,   believes  and similar language.  Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed herein. You should carefully review the risks described herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.  
   
  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.  
   
 All references in this Form 10-Q to the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our  are to E-Waste Corp. and its consolidated subsidiary, Peekay Boutiques Inc. 
   
  General Overview  
   
 We were organized in the State of Florida on January 26, 2012, to develop an e-waste recycling business.  We were not successful in our efforts and have discontinued this line of business.  Since that time, we have been a  shell company  (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). 
   
 Going forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders.  No specific assets or businesses have been definitively identified and there is no certainty that any such assets or business will be identified or any transactions will be consummated.  See Part I, Item 1,  Business  and Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, filed with the SEC on June 15, 2016, for additional information and risks associated with our proposed business plan. 
   
 On November 18, 2014, we formed our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Peekay Boutiques Inc., solely in connection with a potential business combination for which we determined not to proceed.  Peekay Boutiques Inc. has no business or operations. 
   
 During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of Exchange Act reports, and possible costs relating to consummating an acquisition or combination. 
   
 We expect that we will need to raise funds in order to effectuate our business plan.  We have no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds, and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means.  Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for the consummation of an acquisition may have a severe negative impact on our ability to become a viable company. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which contemplates our continuation as a going concern.  We have not yet generated any revenue and have incurred losses to date of $276,457.  In addition, our current liabilities exceed our current assets by $232,692. To date we have funded our operations through advances from a shareholder and the sale of common stock.  We intend on financing our future development activities and our working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern.  Our ability to continue our operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon our ability to raise capital sufficient to fund our commitments and ongoing losses, and ultimately generate profitable operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoptions of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of operations. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  Three Month Period Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three Month Period Ended August 31, 2015  
   
  Revenues and Other Income   
   
 During the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not realize any revenues from operations. 
   
  Expenses   
   
 Operating expenses, consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses (including professional fees) totaled $19,252 in the three-month period ended August 31, 2016, compared to $25,496 in the three-month period ended August 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of ordinary operating expenses and professional fees. 
   
  Net Losses   
   
 As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of $19,252 or $(0.00) per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $25,496, or $(0.00) per share, for the corresponding period ended August 31, 2015. 

Six Month Period Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Six Month Period Ended August 31, 2015  
   
  Revenues and Other Income   
   
 During the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not realize any revenues from operations. 
   
  Expenses   
   
 Operating expenses, consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses (including professional fees) totaled $42,133 in the six-month period ended August 31, 2016, compared to $40,169 in the six-month period ended August 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of ordinary operating expenses and professional fees. 
   
  Net Losses   
   
 As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of $42,133 or $(0.00) per share, for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $40,169, or $(0.00) per share, for the corresponding period ended August 31, 2015. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 As of the date of this report, we had yet to generate any revenues from our business operations.  For the period ended February 28, 2012, we issued 9,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for cash proceeds of $9,000.  We also sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering, which closed on June 14, 2012, for aggregate cash proceeds of $36,000. 
   
 As of August 31, 2016, we had no cash, we had liabilities of $237,692, and our working capital deficit was $232,692.  We anticipate that our current liquidity is not sufficient to meet the obligations associated with being a company that is fully reporting with the SEC. 
   
 To date, we have managed to keep our monthly cash flow requirement low for two reasons.  First, our sole officer does not draw a salary at this time.  Second, we have been able to keep our operating expenses to a minimum by operating in space provided at no expense by one of our shareholders. 
   
 We currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions or off-balance sheet arrangements that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital. 
   
 Our sole director and officer has made no commitments written or oral, with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. 

- 11 - 

In the six-month period ended August 31, 2016, a shareholder of ours made loans to us in the amount of $37,075 to pay certain of our expenses.  However, going forward, this shareholder has made no commitments written or oral, with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. 
   
 We expect that we will need to raise funds in order to effectuate our business plan.  We anticipate that we will need to seek financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds.  If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to seek a buyer for our business or another entity with which we could create a joint venture.  If all of these alternatives fail, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws. 
   
 Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. See Note 2 of our financial statements. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We have never entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not formed any special purpose entities.  We have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non-financial assets. 
   
  Contractual Obligations  
   
 None. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
   
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation we conducted on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, that occurred during our second fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
