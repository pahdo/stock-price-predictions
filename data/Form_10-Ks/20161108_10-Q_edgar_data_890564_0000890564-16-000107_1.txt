ON ASSIGNMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. Financial Statement Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The   December 31, 2015   condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements. The financial statements include adjustments consisting of normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of On Assignment, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") and its results of operations for the interim dates and periods set forth herein. The results for any of the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other period. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ("  2015   10-K"). 

2. Accounting Standards Update    
    
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. It is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the provisions of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  , which is intended to simplify the accounting for the taxes related to stock-based compensation. Under the new guidance excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement, rather than in the balance sheet within additional paid-in capital. The new guidance also makes amendments to the following areas: presentation of excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies on the statement of cash flows, accounting for forfeitures, and presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet minimum statutory withholding requirements. It is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the provisions of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which outlines a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations contained in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which further clarifies the implementation guidance relating to identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which further clarifies guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, practical expedients, and transition. These standards, pursuant to ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Deferral of the Effective Date (Topic 606)   issued by the FASB in August 2015, will be effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact these new standards will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. It is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the provisions of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated statements of cash flows.  

3. Acquisitions    
    
  On   June 5, 2015  , the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the holding company for   Creative Circle, LLC   ("Creative Circle"). Creative Circle, which   is headquartered in Los Angeles, California  ,   was purchased to expand the Company s technical and creative staffing services  . The purchase price consisted of   $540.0 million   cash,   $30.2 million   of common stock (  794,700   shares of the Company s common stock), and estimated future contingent consideration which was valued at   $13.8 million   in the purchase price allocation. Acquisition expenses of approximately   $5.7 million   were expensed in 2015 and are included in selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses. 
    
  The final value of the contingent consideration was   $15.8 million  , an increase of   $2.0 million   from the initial valuation. This increase consisted of (i) accretion of discount, as the initial value was recorded on a discounted basis and (ii) an increase in the obligation due to higher than expected post-acquisition performance of the acquired business. The   $15.8 million   obligation was paid in the second quarter of 2016, of which   $13.8 million   was included in cash used in financing activities and   $2.0 million   in cash used in operating activities. 

7 

On   April 14, 2015  , the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of   LabResource B.V.   ("LabResource")   headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands   for   $12.7 million  . LabResource was purchased to   expand the Company's life sciences staffing business in Europe  . Acquisition expenses of approximately   $0.4 million   were expensed in 2015 and are included in SG A expenses.  
    
  The results of operations for the Creative Circle and LabResource acquisitions (the "Acquisitions") have been combined with those of the Company from the acquisition date.  
    
  The summary below (in thousands, except for per share data) presents pro forma unaudited consolidated results of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as if the Acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2014. The pro forma financial information gives effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on acquisition-related debt, provision for income taxes, and increased number of common shares as a result of the Acquisitions. Acquisition-related costs are assumed to have occurred at the beginning of the year prior to acquisition. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the Acquisitions had been consummated as of the date indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results.  

4. Discontinued Operations    
    
  On February 1, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its Physician Segment for   $123.0 million   including   $6.0 million   that was held in escrow and was released in March 2016. The gain on the sale was   $25.7 million   (net of income taxes of   $14.4 million  ). The operating results of this segment are presented as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for all periods presented.  
    
  Cash flows from discontinued operations are included in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The cash flows that are attributable to the Physician Segment are as follows (in thousands):  

There were no significant cash flows attributable to the Physician Segment for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  .

There were no significant operating results from discontinued operations after March 31, 2015. The following is a summary of the operating results of all of the Company's discontinued operations in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   (in thousands): 

5. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets    
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands):

6. Long-Term Debt    
    
  Long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands): 

On June 5, 2015, the Company entered into a   $975.0 million   credit facility. The funds were used to repay the old credit facility and to fund the cash portion of the purchase of Creative Circle (see "Note   3. Acquisitions  "). The facility consists of (i) an   $825.0 million   seven-year term B loan facility and (ii) a   $150.0 million   five-year revolving credit facility. 
    
  The credit facility was amended on August 5, 2016, resulting in a 25 basis points reduction in the interest rate for the term B loan facility. Related to the August 5, 2016 amendment, the Company incurred   $0.9 million   of third-party fees which are included in interest expense, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The revolving credit facility remains unchanged.  
    
  Borrowings under the term B loan bear interest at LIBOR (floor of 75 basis points), plus   2.75 percent  , and borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR (or the bank s base rate) plus   0.75   to   2.5 percent   depending on leverage levels.  A commitment fee of   0.25   to   0.40 percent   is payable on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate was   3.5 percent  .   
    
  Under terms of the credit facility, the Company is required to make minimum quarterly payments of   $2.1 million   and mandatory prepayments, subject to specified exceptions, from excess cash flow and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and specified other events. Because of the principal payments made through   September 30, 2016  , no additional minimum quarterly payments are required.  
    
  The Company's obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company's tangible and intangible property and by a pledge of all of the equity interests in its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries.  
  The credit facility includes various restrictive covenants including the maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (  4.00   to 1.00 as of   September 30, 2016   decreasing to   3.25   to 1.00 on March 31, 2018). The credit facility also contains certain customary limitations including, among other terms and conditions, the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and declare dividends. At   September 30, 2016   the Company had a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of   2.38   to 1.00. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and had   $142.5 million   of borrowing available under the revolving credit facility. 

7. Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  The Company has entered into various non-cancelable operating leases, primarily related to its facilities and certain office equipment used in the ordinary course of business. The Comp  any leases   two   properties owned by related parties. Rent expense for these two properties was   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Rent expense for these two properties was   $1.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  The Company carries large retention policies for its workers  compensation liability exposures.  The workers' compensation loss reserves are based upon an actuarial report obtained from a third party and determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. The Company accounts for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data. Changes in estimates, differences in estimates, and actual payments for claims, are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or the payments were made. The workers' compensation loss reserves were approximately   $1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , net of anticipated insurance and indemnification recoveries of   $14.2 million   and   $13.2 million  , at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company has unused stand-by letters of credit to secure obligations for workers  compensation claims with various insurance carriers. The unused stand-by letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $3.5 million  . 
    
  Certain employees participate in the Company s Change in Control Severance Plan, or have separate agreements that provide for certain benefits in the event of termination at the Company's convenience or following a change in control, as defined by the plan or agreement. Generally, these benefits are based on the employee s position with the Company and include severance, continuation of health insurance and a pro rata bonus.  

10 

Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on the facts currently available, the Company does not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

8. Fair Value Measurements    
    
  The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value based on their short-term nature. Long-term debt recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   was   $658.6 million   (net of   $16.4 million   of unamortized deferred loan costs, see "Note   6. Long-Term Debt  "). The fair value of the long-term debt at that same date was   $674.9 million   as dete  rmined using the quoted price technique, based on Level 2 inputs (significant observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets in active markets) from the fair value hierarchy, and included the yields of comparable companies with similar credit characteristics  . 
    
  Related to its acquisitions, the Company had obligations to pay contingent consideration in cash if certain performance targets were met. Contingent consideration obligations were paid during the current year. Prior to completing the performance period, the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using an expected present value technique. Expected cash flows were determined using the probability-weighted average of possible outcomes that would occur should certain financial metrics be reached. There is no market data available to use in valuing the contingent consideration, therefore, the Company developed its own assumptions related to the future financial performance of the businesses to evaluate the fair value of these liabilities. As such, the contingent consideration was classified within Level 3 inputs (unobservable inputs) from the fair value hierarchy.     The fair value of the liability for contingent consideration was established at the time of the acquisition and finalized by the end of the measurement period. The fair value was     then     remeasured on a   recurring basis with c  hanges due to the accretion of the present value discount recorded in interest expense, and changes related to new developments in expected performance recorded in SG A expenses.  
    
  The following table summarizes the balance of the contingent consideration and changes for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Certain assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For   the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  , no fair value adjustments were required for non-financial assets or liabilities. 

9. Stockholders' Equity    
    
  The number of shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock units, exercise of stock options and stock purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was   175,440   and   738,507   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, whereby the Company may repurchase up to   $150.0 million   of its common stock over the next two years. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   510,411   and    607,911   shares of its common stock at a cost of   $19.0 million   and   $22.6 million  , respectively. All shares repurchased under this program were retired, which resulted in a reduction of   $5.4 million   and   $6.4 million   in paid-in capital and a reduction of   $13.6 million   and   $16.2 million   in retained earnings, for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  The accumulated other comprehensive loss balance at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and other comprehensive income during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , consists of foreign currency translation adjustments.   

11 

10. Stock-based Compensation      
    
  Stock-based compensation expense, which is included in SG A expenses, was   $6.3 million   and   $6.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $19.8 million   and   $15.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

11. Earnings Per Share    
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands): 

The amount of anti-dilutive share equivalents outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was insignificant.  

12. Income Taxes    
    
  For interim reporting periods, the Company s provision for income taxes is calculated using its annualized estimated effective tax rate for the year. This rate is based on our estimated full-year income and the related income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate. Changes in the geographical mix, permanent differences or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can impact the Company s actual effective rate. This rate is adjusted for the effects of discrete items occurring in the quarter. During the quarter, discrete items included the research and development tax credit of   $0.7 million   for tax years 2014 and 2015. This discrete item lowered the effective tax rate for the quarter approximately   1.5   percentage points.  

13. Segment Reporting    
    
  On Assignment provides services through   two   operating segments, the Apex Segment and the Oxford Segment, with each addressing different sectors of the professional staffing market with distinct business models attuned to those sectors. Businesses in the Apex Segment predominately serve markets with a large and local talent pool, and provide a full range of skills through a network of local offices where clients most value relationship, speed, reliability and price. The Apex Segment provides a broad spectrum of technical, scientific and creative professionals for temporary, contract-to-hire and permanent placement positions and consulting services to Fortune 1000 and mid-market clients across the United States. Our businesses in this segment include Apex Systems, Lab Support and Creative Circle. Businesses in the Oxford Segment predominately serve markets with higher-end, specialized skills through a combination of national recruiting centers and local offices where clients most value the unique skill of the candidate and speed of response. The Oxford Segment provides specialized niche staffing, permanent placement and consulting services in select skill and geographic markets. Our businesses in this segment include Oxford, CyberCoders and Life Sciences Europe. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, there were two changes to the Company's segment configuration: 1) the Apex Segment now includes a small clinical research business which was previously included in the Oxford Segment, and 2) costs associated with personnel located at our Corporate office that have shared services roles and support certain of our businesses, primarily within the Oxford Segment, are now presented in the segments they support whereas previously they were presented within Corporate. For comparability purposes, prior periods have been adjusted to reflect these changes. 
    
  The Company s management evaluates the performance of each segment primarily based on revenues, gross profit and operating income. The information in the following tables is derived directly from the segments  internal financial reporting used for corporate management purposes.  The Company's management does not evaluate, manage or measure performance of segments using asset information, and such information is not readily available. Accordingly, assets by reportable segment are not disclosed.

OVERVIEW 
    
  On Assignment, Inc., is a leading global provider of highly skilled, hard-to-find professionals in the growing technology, life sciences, and creative sectors, where quality people are the key to success.  We go beyond matching r sum s with job descriptions to match people we know into positions we understand, for contract, contract-to-hire and direct hire assignments. 
    
  On Assignment provides services through two operating segments, the Apex Segment and the Oxford Segment, with each addressing different sectors of the professional staffing market with distinct business models attuned to those sectors. Businesses in the Apex Segment predominately serve markets with a large and local talent pool, and provide a full range of skills through a network of local offices where clients most value relationship, speed, reliability and price. The Apex Segment provides a broad spectrum of technical, scientific, and creative professionals for temporary, contract-to-hire and permanent placement positions, and consulting services to Fortune 1000 and mid-market clients across the United States. Our businesses in this segment include Apex Systems, Lab Support and Creative Circle. Businesses in the Oxford Segment predominately serve markets with higher-end, specialized skills through a combination of national recruiting centers and local offices where clients most value the unique skill of the candidate and speed of response. The Oxford Segment provides specialized niche staffing, permanent placement and consulting services in select skill and geographic markets. Our businesses in this segment include Oxford, CyberCoders and Life Sciences Europe. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, there was a change to our segment configuration whereby the Apex Segment now includes a small clinical research business, which was previously included in the Oxford Segment. For comparability purposes, prior periods have been adjusted to reflect these changes. 
    
  Pro forma revenues and gross profit by segment are presented in the tables and discussion below to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between periods.  Pro forma data were prepared as if the acquisitions of Creative Circle and LabResource (the "Acquisitions") were consummated at the beginning of 2014. Although the pro forma segment data are considered non-GAAP measures, they were calculated in the same manner as the consolidated pro forma data, which are GAAP measures.

Results of Operations 
    
  CHANGES IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE   THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    
  COMPARED WITH THE   THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    
  (Dollars in millions) 

Revenues increased   $57.3 million  , or   10.0 percent   year-over-year. The year-over-year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial effect on the revenue growth rates for the quarter. 
    
  Assignment revenues were   $596.4 million  , up   10.6 percent   year-over-year. Permanent placement revenues, comprised of direct hire and conversion fees, were   $33.0 million  , up   0.7 percent   year-over-year. Permanent placement revenues accounted for   5.2 percent   of total revenues compared with   5.7 percent   for the   third quarter   of last year. 
    
  The Apex Segment accounted for   75.2 percent   of consolidated revenues in the   third quarter   of   2016  , up from   73.9 percent   in the same period of last year. Its revenues were   $473.6 million  , up   12.0 percent   year-over-year. This increase was a result of the high growth of Apex Systems (the segment's IT services unit), which accounted for   73.7 percent   of the segment's revenues and had a year-over-year growth rate of   12.1 percent  , reflecting the continued high demand from our large customer accounts, and the high growth from Creative Circle, which accounted for   17.8 percent   of the segment's revenues and had a year-over-year growth rate of   15.6 percent  .  
    
  The Oxford Segment accounted for   24.8 percent   of consolidated revenues in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared with   26.1 percent   in the same period of last year. Its revenues were   $155.8 million  , up   4.3 percent   year-over-year primarily due to (i) growth in key accounts, (ii) increased demand for EMR (electronic medical records system) implementations, upgrades and optimization projects within our Healthcare IT business unit, and (iii) growth across most skill disciplines in our European IT operations. Assignment revenues were   $134.4 million   in the quarter, compared with   $127.5 million   in the third quarter of last year. Permanent placement revenues for the quarter were   $21.4 million  , or   13.8 percent   of the segment's revenues, down from   $22.0 million  , or   14.7 percent   of the segment's revenues in the   third quarter   of   2015  . The year-over-year decline in permanent placement revenues reflected lower demand from technology-based clients, specifically early stage companies, and the lengthening in the time our clients are taking to make hiring decisions and a tight candidate pool.

Gross Profit and Gross Margins 

Gross profit is comprised of revenues less costs of services, which consist primarily of compensation for our contract professionals and assignment-related expenses. Gross profit for the current quarter was   $207.1 million  , up   8.2 percent   year-over-year. Gross margin was   32.9 percent  , a compression of   60   basis points year-over-year primarily due to a lower mix of permanent placement revenues and higher growth of our high-volume, lower-margin accounts. 
    
  The Apex Segment accounted for   69.4 percent   of consolidated gross profit in the current quarter. Its gross profit was   $143.7 million  , up   11.2 percent   year-over-year. Gross margin for the segment was   30.3 percent  , a compression of   30   basis points year-over-year related to the shift in business mix toward higher-volume, lower-margin accounts. 
    
  The Oxford Segment accounted for   30.6 percent   of consolidated gross profit in the current quarter. Its gross profit was   $63.4 million  , up   2.0 percent   year-over-year. Gross margin for the segment was   40.7 percent  , a compression of   90   basis points year-over-year due to lower permanent placement revenues (  13.8 percent   of the segment's revenues in the current quarter down from   14.7 percent   in the third quarter of 2015).  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our field operations and corporate staff, rent, information systems, marketing, telecommunications, public company expenses and other general and administrative expenses. SG A expenses for the quarter were   $142.0 million   (  22.6 percent   of revenues), compared with   $128.6 million   (  22.5 percent   of revenues) in the same period of last year. This increase was mainly due to higher compensation expense related to (i) added headcount and  higher incentive compensation (commensurate with growth in the business) and (ii) higher incentive bonus accruals as current operating performance was more in line with our incentive performance targets than was the case in the same period of last year. 
    
  SG A expenses in the   third quarter   of   2016   included   $0.7 million   in acquisition and integration expenses primarily related to the integration of certain operating units onto Oxford's front and back office systems, compared with   $1.7 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , which primarily related to the acquisition of Creative Circle.  
    
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
    
  Amortization of intangible assets for the quarter was   $9.7 million  , compared with   $11.3 million   in the same period of last year.  The decrease is due to the accelerated amortization method for certain acquired intangibles, which have higher amortization rates at the beginning of their useful life.  
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
    
  Interest expense (net of interest income) for the quarter was   $8.3 million  , compared with   $9.5 million   in the same period of last year. Interest expense for the quarter was comprised of (i)   $6.5 million   of interest on the credit facility, (ii)   $0.9 million   of amortization of deferred loan costs and (iii)   $0.9 million   third-party fees related to the August 5, 2016 amendment to our credit facility. Interest expense for the same period of last year was comprised of (i) interest on the credit facility of $7.9 million, (ii) amortization of deferred loan costs of $0.9 million, and (iii) accretion of discount of $0.7 million on the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions. The decrease in interest expense reflected a lower interest rate due to the credit facility amendment and a lower debt balance. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes was   $17.3 million   for the quarter, compared with   $17.0 million   in the same period of last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was   36.8 percent  , a decrease from the   41.4 percent   for the full year   2015  . This lower effective tax rate was due to (i) a lower mix of non-deductible expenses, (ii) research and development tax credit for taxable years 2014 and 2015 (approximately $0.7 million) and (iii) the estimated full year credit for 2016 (approximately $0.4 million). 

16 

Net Income 
    
  Net income was   $29.8 million   for the quarter, compared with   $24.9 million   in the same period of last year.   

Results of Operations 
    
  CHANGES IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE   NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    
  COMPARED WITH THE   NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    
  (Dollars in millions) 

____________ 
  (1) Pro forma data were prepared as if the Acquisitions were consummated at the beginning of 2014. 
    
  Revenues on an as reported basis increased   $332.0 million  , or   22.3 percent   year-over-year as a result of (i) the contribution of revenues from the Acquisitions and (ii) year-over-year revenue growth from virtually all other operating divisions. On a pro forma basis, revenues were up   $218.1 million  , or   13.6 percent  , year-over-year. The year-over-year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial effect on the revenue growth rates for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Assignment revenues were   $1,720.3 million  , up   22.7 percent   year-over-year on an as reported basis and   14.2 percent   on a pro forma basis. Permanent placement revenues, comprised of direct hire and conversion fees, were   $99.2 million  , up   16.2 percent   year-over-year on an as reported basis and   4.8 percent   on pro forma basis.  Permanent placement revenues accounted for   5.5 percent   of total revenues compared with   5.9 percent   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   on a pro forma basis.  
    
  The Apex Segment accounted for   74.8 percent   of consolidated revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , up from   73.1 percent   in the same period of last year on a pro forma basis. Its revenues were   $1,360.4 million  , up   28.5 percent   year-over-year on an as reported basis. This increase was a result of (i) inclusion of Creative Circle for the full nine months ended September 30, 2016 which accounted for   17.7 percent   of the segment's revenue, whereas the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included Creative Circle's results from the date of acquisition (June 5, 2015) through September 30, 2015 and (ii) the high growth of Apex Systems, which accounted for   73.8 percent   of the segment's revenues and had a year-over-year growth rate of   17.0 percent  , reflecting the continued high demand from our large customer accounts. On a pro forma basis, revenues for the segment were up   16.2 percent   year-over-year primarily related to the high growth rate for Apex Systems and continued high growth from Creative Circle which grew   17.9 percent   year-over-year.   
    
  The Oxford Segment accounted for   25.2 percent   of consolidated revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   26.9 percent   in the same period of last year on a pro forma basis. Its revenues were   $459.1 million  , up   7.2 percent   year-over-year on an as reported  
  
   17 

basis primarily due to growth in IT assignment revenues. Assignment revenues were   $394.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $364.7 million   in the same period of last year. Permanent placement revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $64.3 million  , or   14.0 percent   of the segment's revenues, compared with   $63.7 million  , or   14.9 percent   of the segment's revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This reduction in permanent placement revenues as a percentage of the segment's revenues reflects lower demand from technology-based clients, specifically early stage companies, and the lengthening in the time our clients are taking to make hiring decisions and a tight candidate pool.  
    
  Gross Profit and Gross Margins 

____________ 
  (1) Pro forma data were prepared as if the Acquisitions were consummated at the beginning of 2014. 
    
  Gross profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $597.0 million  , up   22.9 percent   year-over-year. Gross margin was   32.8 percent  , an expansion of   10   basis points year-over-year on an as reported basis. This expansion related to the inclusion of Creative Circle for the full nine months ended September 30, 2016, whereas the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included Creative Circle's results from the date of acquisition (June 5, 2015) through September 30, 2015. Creative Circle has a higher assignment gross margin than our other contract services divisions. On a pro forma basis, our gross margin compressed   60   basis points year-over-year, which was primarily due to a lower mix of permanent placement revenues (  5.5 percent   of revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with   5.9 percent   in the same period of last year), and higher growth in high-volume, lower-margin accounts. 
    
  The Apex Segment accounted for   68.3 percent   of consolidated gross profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Its gross profit was   $408.0 million  , up   32.6 percent   year-over-year on an as reported basis. Gross margin for the segment was   30.0 percent  , an expansion of   1.0   percentage point year-over-year due to the inclusion of Creative Circle for the full nine months (Creative Circle's assignment margin is higher than the other operating units of the Apex Segment). On a pro forma basis, gross margin for the segment was   30   basis points lower than the same period of last year, related to the shift in business mix toward higher-volume, lower-margin accounts.  
    
  The Oxford Segment accounted for   31.7 percent   of consolidated gross profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Its gross profit was   $189.0 million  , up   6.1 percent   year-over-year on an as reported basis. Gross margin for the segment was   41.2 percent  , a compression of   40   basis points year-over-year due to lower permanent placement revenues (  14.0 percent   of the segment's revenues in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   down from   14.9 percent   in the same period of last year).  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  SG A expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $423.2 million   (  23.3 percent   of revenues), compared with   $353.4 million   (  23.8 percent   of revenues) in the same period of last year.  This increase was mainly due to (i) the Acquisitions' incremental $31.5 million SG A expenses (mainly due to the inclusion of Creative Circle for the full nine months), (ii) added headcount and higher incentive compensation (commensurate with growth in the business), (iii) higher incentive bonus accruals as current operating performance was more in line with our incentive performance targets than was the case in the same period of last year, and (iv) $4.6 million higher stock-based compensation expense. 
    
  SG A expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   $4.5 million   in acquisition and integration expenses primarily related to the integration of certain operating units onto Oxford's front and back office systems, compared with   $9.9 million   in the same period of last year, which primarily related to the acquisition of Creative Circle and the integration of certain operating and back office systems. 
    
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
    
  Amortization of intangible assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $29.9 million  , compared with   $23.2 million   in the same period of last year. The increase related to amortization from the Acquisitions.  
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
    
  Interest expense (net of interest income) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $25.3 million  , compared with   $17.3 million   in the same period of last year. The increase in interest expense was due to higher debt levels related to the June 5, 2015 acquisition of Creative Circle, which was funded primarily from proceeds from borrowings. Interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was comprised of  
  
   18 

(i) interest on the credit facility of   $20.7 million  , (ii) amortization of deferred loan costs of   $2.8 million  , (iii) accretion of discount of   $0.9 million   on the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions and (iv)   $0.9 million   third-party fees related to the August 5, 2016 amendment to our credit facility. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was comprised of (i) interest on the credit facility of $14.8 million, (ii) amortization of deferred loan costs of $1.8 million, and (iii) accretion of discount of $0.7 million on the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions. 
    
  Write-off of Loan Costs  
    
  Write-off of loan costs was   $3.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and related to the refinancing of our credit facility in June 2015.  
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes was   $45.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $35.9 million   in the same period of last year. The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   38.3 percent  , a decrease from the 41.4 percent for the full year 2015. This lower effective tax rate was due to (i) a lower mix of non-deductible expenses, (ii)  research and development tax credit for taxable years 2014 and 2015 (approximately $0.7 million) and (iii) the estimated full year credit for 2016 (approximately $0.4 million). 
    
  Income from Continuing Operations 
    
  Income from continuing operations was   $73.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $52.2 million   in the same period of last year.   
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  The gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of income tax, was   $25.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the sale of our Physician Segment.  
    
  Net Income 
    
  Net income was   $73.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $78.3 million   in the same period of last year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities) at   September 30, 2016   was   $260.4 million   and our cash and cash equivalents were   $17.0 million  , of which   $9.8 million   was held in foreign countries, which is not available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated. We do not intend to repatriate cash held in foreign countries. Our cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities have been our primary source of liquidity and have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by the overall growth in our business and debt service requirements.  We believe that our expected cash flows and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our obligations, working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next 12 months.  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $140.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $87.3 million   for the same period of last year. The increase primarily related to higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, etc.), which was   $151.9 million   for the current nine-month period, up from   $117.0 million   in the same period of last year. This improvement related to the growth in the business and the inclusion of Creative Circle, which was acquired in June 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for the current period was reduced by   $11.5 million   related to the change in operating assets and liabilities. For the same period in 2015, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a   $29.7 million   use of cash, which included the $14.4 million in income taxes paid related to the gain from the sale of the Physician Segment. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $15.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $455.5 million   for the same period of last year. Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was comprised of   $20.6 million   used to purchase property and equipment and   $6.0 million   collected from the release of escrow from the sale of our Physician Segment. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquisitions was   $552.8 million  , which was partially offset by the net proceeds from sale of the Physician Segment of   $115.4 million  .  
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $132.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $366.5 million   cash provided by financing activities for the same period of last year. Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of   $106.0 million   in principal payments of long-term debt,   $21.5 million   used for repurchases of our common stock,   and   $16.8 million   in payments of contingent considerations (total payment of   $21.6 million  , of which   $16.8 million   was cash used in financing activities and   $4.8 million   was cash used in operating activities). Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   consisted primarily of $  875.0 million   proceeds from the credit facility entered into on June 5, 2015, partially offset by   $486.1 million   in principal payments of long-term debt.  

19 

On June 5, 2015, the Company entered into a $975.0 million credit facility. The funds were used to repay the old credit facility and to fund the cash portion of the purchase of Creative Circle (see "Note   3. Acquisitions  "). This facility consists of (i) an $825.0 million seven-year term B loan facility and (ii) a $150.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility was amended on August 5, 2016, resulting in a 25 basis points reduction in the interest rate for the term B loan facility. Related to the August 5, 2016 amendment, the Company incurred   $0.9 million   of third-party fees which are included in interest expense, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The revolving credit facility remains unchanged.  
    
  Under terms of the credit facility, we are required to make minimum quarterly payments of   $2.1 million   and mandatory prepayments, subject to specified exceptions, from excess cash flow and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and specified other events. Because of the principal payments made through   September 30, 2016  , no additional minimum quarterly payments are required. The outstanding balance on the facility at   September 30, 2016   was   $675.0 million   (see "Note   6. Long-Term Debt  "). The maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA steps down at regular intervals from   4.00   to 1.00 as of   September 30, 2016  , to   3.25   to 1.00 as of March 31, 2018 and thereafter. As of   September 30, 2016  , the leverage ratio was   2.38   to 1.00. Additionally, the credit facility, which is secured by substantially all of our assets, provides for certain limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, offer loans, and declare dividends. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $142.5 million   of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility.  
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program whereby the Company may repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock over the next two years. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   we purchased   607,911   shares for   $22.6 million   ($37.13 average price per share). The remaining authorized amount under this program is $127.4 million.

  With respect to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, there have been no material changes to the information included in our   2015   10-K. 
    
  We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates.  
    
  Foreign Currency Fluctuations.   Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of our reported earnings, investments in our foreign subsidiaries, and intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of our stockholders  equity. The assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations, we do not believe that a 10 percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements.  
    
  Interest Rate Risk.   Our exposure to interest rate risk is associated with our debt instruments. See the "Note   6. Long-Term Debt  " in the condensed consolidated financial statements for further description of our debt instruments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately   $6.8 million   based on   $675.0 million   of debt outstanding for any 12-month period. We have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for hedging or trading purposes.

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term  disclosure controls and procedures  means controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1   Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, based on the facts currently available, we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A       Risk Factors 
    
  Information regarding risk factors affecting our business is discussed in our   2015   10-K.
