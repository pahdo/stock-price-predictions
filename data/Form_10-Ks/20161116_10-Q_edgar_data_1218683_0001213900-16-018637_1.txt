       GENERAL    

a.    OphthaliX
                                         Inc. (the  Company  or  OphthaliX ), originally incorporated in the
                                         State of Nevada on December 10, 1999 under the name Bridge Capital.com Inc., was a nominally
                                         capitalized corporation that did not commence its operations until it changed its name
                                         to Denali Concrete Management Inc. ( Denali ), in March 2001. Denali was a
                                         concrete placement company specializing in providing concrete improvements in the road
                                         construction industry. Denali operated primarily in Anchorage, Alaska, placing curb and
                                         gutter, sidewalks and retaining walls for state, municipal and military projects.    

In
December 2005, the Company ceased its principal business operations and focused its efforts on seeking a business opportunity,
becoming a public shell company in the U.S.  

Eye-Fite
Ltd. ( Eye-Fite  or the  Subsidiary ) was founded on June 27, 2011 in contemplation of the execution of a
transaction between Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. (the  Parent company  or  Can-Fite ), a public company in Israel
and U.S, and the Company, as further detailed in Note 1b below.  

The
Company and its Subsidiary conduct research and development activities using an exclusive worldwide license for CF101, a synthetic
A3 adenosine receptor, or A3AR, agonist (known generically as IB-MECA) solely for the field of ophthalmic diseases after the consummation
of the transaction. See also Note 1b2.  

Following
the transaction, Denali changed its name to OphthaliX Inc. and also changed its corporate domicile from Nevada to Delaware.  

On July 5, 2016,
the Company released top-line results from its Phase II clinical trial of CF101 for the treatment of glaucoma. In this trial,
no statistically significant differences were found between the CF101 treated group and the placebo group in the primary endpoint
of lowering intra ocular pressure ( IOP ). High IOP is a characteristic of glaucoma. CF101 was found to have a favorable
safety profile and was well tolerated. 

In September 2016,
the Company s board of directors and Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. ( Can-Fite ), the Company s parent and majority
shareholder, consented in writing to, among other things, the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to
a Plan of Dissolution. 

In November, 2016, the board
of directors of the Company abandoned the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company. Subsequently on November 15, 2016,
the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with an Israeli company for the acquisition of such company by way of a
reverse triangular merger. The proposed reverse merger is subject to signing of definitive transaction documents and the completion
of closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent will be completed.

b.    Reverse
                                         Recapitalization and related arrangements:    

1.    Recapitalization:    

On
November 21, 2011 (the  Closing Date ), Can-Fite purchased 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par
value $ 0.001 per share in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Eyefite pursuant to the terms of
a stock purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ).  As a result, Eyefite became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company and Can-Fite became its majority stockholder and a parent.  

Also
on November 21, 2011, the Company issued a warrant to Can-Fite by which Can-Fite has the right, until the earlier of (a) the November
21, 2016 and (b) the closing of the acquisition of the Company by another entity, resulting in the exchange of the Company s
outstanding common shares such that its stockholders prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the
voting power of the surviving entity, to convert its right to the Additional Payment (as defined below) into 480,022 shares of
Common Stock (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances).  The per share exercise price for the shares is $ 5.148.    

The
Company also received 714,922 ordinary shares in Can-Fite, representing approximately 7% of Can-Fite's issued and outstanding
share capital as of the Closing Date. On June 17, 2013, the Company sold 268,095 Can-Fite ordinary shares for a total consideration
of $511. As of September 30, 2016, the Company holds 446,827 Can-Fite ordinary shares, representing approximately 1.6% of Can-Fite's
outstanding share capital.  

In
contemplation of the recapitalization transaction, it was agreed that for every four shares of Common Stock purchased by the New
Investors and Can-Fite, they received nine warrants to acquire two share of Common Stock of the Company. The exercise price of
such warrants is $ 7.74 per share of Common Stock. The warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of grant.
The warrants do not contain nonstandard anti-dilution provisions (see also Note 6b to the consolidated financial statements as
of December 31, 2015).  

The
transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization which is outside the scope ASC 805, Business Combinations. Under reverse
capitalization accounting, EyeFite is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes, and acquired the
assets and assumed the liabilities of the Company. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are reported at their historical amounts.
Consequently, the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the operations of the acquirer for accounting
purposes together with a deemed issuance of shares, equivalent to the shares held by the former shareholders of the legal acquirer
and a recapitalization of the equity of the accounting acquirer. These condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company since the effective date of the reverse capitalization and the accounts of EyeFite since inception.  

2.    License
                                         and research and development services from Can-Fite:    

In
connection with the consummation of the recapitalization transaction, the Company and Can-Fite entered into a license agreement,
pursuant to which Can-Fite granted EyeFite a sole and exclusive worldwide license for the use of CF101, solely in the field of
ophthalmic diseases ( CF101 ). EyeFite will be obligated to make to the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ),
with regard to the patents of which are included in the license to EyeFite, for as long as the license agreement between the Company
and NIH remains in effect, a nonrefundable minimum annual royalty fee and potential future royalties of 4.0% to 5.5% on net sales.

In
addition, the Company will be obligated to make certain milestone payments ranging from $25 to $500 upon the achievement of various
development milestones for each indication. During 2013, the Company accrued an amount of $75 related to the glaucoma phase II
clinical trial. EyeFite will also be required to make payments of 20% of sublicensing revenues, excluding royalties and net of
the required milestone payments. Until September 30, 2016, the Company did not reach any milestone or generate revenue that would
trigger additional payments to Can-Fite.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the aggregate amount accrued for these milestones payment is $ 175.  

In
addition, following the closing of the recapitalization transaction, Can-Fite, OphthaliX and EyeFite entered into a service agreement
(the  Service Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Service Agreement, Can-Fite will manage the research and development
activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101. In consideration
for Can-Fite's services, EyeFite will pay to Can-Fite a service fee (consisting of all expenses and costs incurred by Can-Fite
plus 15%). In addition, the Company is committed to future additional payments equal to 2.5% of any and all proceeds received
by EyeFite relating to the activities regarding the drug (the  Additional Payment ).  

According
to the Service Agreement, Can-Fite will have the right, at any time until November 21, 2016, to convert the Additional Payment
into an additional 480,022 shares of Common Stock of the Company for total consideration of $ 2,471 (subject to adjustment in
certain circumstances - See also Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015).  

In
 addition, in February 2013, as last updated in August 2015, the Company obtained a formal letter from Can-Fite stating
that Can-Fite agrees to defer the payments under the Services Agreement from January 31, 2013 for the performance of the clinical
trials of CF101 in ophthalmic indications until the completion of a fundraising by the Company that will allow such payments.
Also, in August 2015, Can-Fite issued another financial support letter, pursuant to which it committed to cover any shortfall
in the costs and expenses of operations of the Company which are in excess of the Company's available cash to finance its operations,
including cash generated from any future sale of Can-Fite shares. Any related balance on amounts owed bear interest at a rate
of 3% per annum. As of September 30, 2016, the deferred payments to Can-Fite totaled $ 4,188. Both letters expired on October
10, 2016. On November 14, 2016, Can-Fite agreed to extend the support letter under the same terms and conditions in order to fund
the operations of the Company. Such letter shall expire on the earlier of (1) the completion of the proposed reverse merger transaction
described in note 1a above, or (2) a decision of OphthaliX to cease any action in relation to such merger, or (3) February 28,
2017. Deferred payments under the Services Agreement are currently due and as of the date hereof Can-Fite has not made a demand
for payment. 

According to management
estimates, liquidity resources as of September 30, 2016, will be sufficient to maintain the Company's operations at least through
December 31, 2016. The Company's inability to raise funds to conduct its research and development activities will have a severe
negative impact on its ability to remain a viable company. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 2:-  
      UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of OphthaliX Inc. have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S.
GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015, included herein was
derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results
of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any future period. The information included in this interim report should be
read in conjunction with  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,   Risk
Factors,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  and the consolidated financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

The
significant accounting policies applied in the annual financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2015 are applied
consistently in these condensed financial statements .For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
as of December 31, 2015.  

NOTE 3:-  
      FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

The
Company considers an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency
and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and views an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions
for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market
makers. Since the quoted market value of the Company s Common Stock was based on a sporadically traded stock with little
volume, the Company's management determined the Company's stock price fair value based on ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement using
the income approach assisted by a third party specialist. Consequently, the derivatives are classified within Level 3 because
they are valued using valuation techniques. The fair value of the Derivative as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted
to $0, was determined using the binomial option-pricing model. The aforementioned option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions,
of which most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected term.  

The
Company's investment in Parent Company ordinary shares is measured in accordance with ASC 820, based on the Parent Company's ordinary
shares fair value as quoted in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

Embedded
derivatives are classified within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation techniques. Some of the inputs to these models
are unobservable in the market and are significant.  

The
Company's investment in Parent Company ordinary shares is measured in accordance with ASC 820, based on the Parent Company's ordinary
shares fair value as quoted in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  

These
securities are classified as available-for-sale securities carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as
a separate component of shareholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. The assets are classified within Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy.  

The
following table provides information by value level for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, as defined

Description
of Business    

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutic products for the treatment of ophthalmic disorders.
We have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications protecting the use in the ophthalmic field of our current pipeline
drug under development, a synthetic A3 adenosine receptor, or A3AR, agonist, CF101 (known generically as IB-MECA).  

In
July 2016, we released top-line results from our Phase II trial with respect to the development of CF101 for the treatment of
glaucoma or related syndromes of ocular hypertension. In this trial, no statistically significant differences were found between
the CF101 treated group and the placebo group in the primary endpoint of lowering intra ocular pressure ( IOP ). CF101
was found to have a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated.  

Subsequently,
in September 2016, our board of directors and Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. ( Can-Fite ), our parent and majority shareholder
consented in writing to, among other things, our voluntary dissolution and liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Dissolution, which
would result in our complete dissolution and liquidation. The Plan of Dissolution was expected to go into effect 20 days after
the date an information statement (the  Information Statement ) is first given to all our shareholders who did not
execute the written consent. In connection with the Plan of Dissolution, we planned to enter into a share purchase agreement with
Can-Fite providing for the sale to Can-Fite of all the ordinary shares of our wholly owned subsidiary, Eyefite Ltd. ( Eyefite ),
which at the time will be a holder of 446,827 of Can-Fite s ordinary shares. As a result of the sale, Eyefite would have
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Can-Fite. In exchange for the sale, Can-Fite would waive and cancel all indebtedness owed
by us and Eyefite to Can-Fite, including approximately $4.5 million of deferred payments owed by us and Eyefite to Can-Fite and,
as part of the purchase of Eyefite, Can-Fite would assume certain accrued milestone payments in the amount of $175,000 under a
license agreement entered into between Can-Fite and Eyefite. Following the sale of Eyefite, it was expected that (i) Eyefite may,
in its sole discretion, sell or otherwise transfer the 446,827 of our ordinary shares that it owns, (ii) Can-Fite would mutually
terminate the license agreement entered into with Eyefite and a related services agreement, and (iii) Eyefite would abandon certain
patents and patent applications that it is the registered owner of.  

We have not distributed
the Information Statement to our shareholders who did not execute the above-referenced written consent and on November 10, 2016,
our board of directors abandoned the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company. On the same day, our board of directors
authorized the Company to enter into a non-binding letter of intent with an Israeli company providing for the acquisition of such
company by way of a reverse triangular merger. Subsequently on November 15, 2016, the Company entered into the non-binding letter
of intent. The proposed reverse merger is subject to signing of definitive transaction documents and the completion of closing
conditions. There can be no assurance that the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent will be completed. 

Results

$550,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $392,000 or 71%. The decrease in research and development
expenses is primarily related to the fact that the Phase II CF101 study for glaucoma was in its final stages during 2016.  

General
and administrative expenses  . General and administrative expenses were $293,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $270,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $23,000 or 9%. The increase in general

As
a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of $244,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared $353,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $109,000 or 31%.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts
receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.  

As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $15,000 and $42,000 in cash and cash equivalents, a working capital deficit of $3,879,000
and $3,281,000 and an accumulated deficit of $9,312,000 and $8,773,000, respectively. The increase in working capital deficit
was primarily due to our expenses financed by our parent company. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately $27,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net cash
provided by operating activities of approximately $8,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net cash
used in operating activities was primarily related to changes in account payables and related parties.  

There
was no net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net cash used in investment
activities of $3,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  

There
was no net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

We have no current source of revenue. In February 2013, Can-Fite issued us a formal letter, which has historically
been updated periodically (most recently in August 2015), stating that Can-Fite agrees to defer payments owed to it under the Services
Agreement (under which Can-Fite manages, as an independent contractor, all activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies
performed for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101) beginning on January 31, 2013 until the completion of fundraising
by the Company sufficient to cover such deferred payments. As of September 30, 2016, the deferred payments to Can-Fite totaled
$4.2 million. In addition, in August 2015, Can-Fite issued a financial support letter pursuant to which it committed to cover any
shortfall in our costs and expenses of the operations which are in excess of our available cash to finance our operations, including
cash generated from any future sale of Can-Fite shares held by us. Any related balance on amounts owed bear interest at a rate
of 3% per annum. On October 10, 2016 both letters expired. On November 14, 2016, Can-Fite agreed to extend the financial support
letter under the same terms and conditions in order to fund our operations. Such letter shall expire on the earlier of (1) the
completion of the proposed reverse merger transaction described above, or (2) a decision of OphthaliX to cease any action in relation
to such merger, or (3) February 28, 2017. Deferred payments under the Services Agreement are currently due and as of the date hereof
Can-Fite has not made a demand for payment.  

Based
on the overall results of our Phase II glaucoma trial, we see no immediate path forward in glaucoma. According to management estimates,
liquidity resources as of September 30, 2016, will be sufficient to maintain the Company's operations at least through December
31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The opinion of our independent
registered public accounting firm on our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains
an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Future reports on our financial
statements may include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.   

As
of the date of this report, we have no material capital commitments.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect
on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity
capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Our
significant accounting policies, which include management s best estimates and judgments, are included in Note 2 to the
financial statements for December 31, 2015 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

As
a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures    

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were
effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
(i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting    

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during
our most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

10, 2016, our board of directors abandoned the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company. On the same day, our board
of directors authorized the Company to enter into a non-binding letter of intent with an Israeli company providing for the acquisition
of such company by way of a reverse triangular merger. Subsequently on November 15, 2016, the Company entered into the non-binding
letter of intent. The proposed reverse merger is subject to signing of definitive transaction documents and the completion of closing
