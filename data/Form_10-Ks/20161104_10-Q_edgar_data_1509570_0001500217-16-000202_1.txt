EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and American Assets Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which American Assets Trust, Inc. is the parent company and sole general partner. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to  we,   us,   our  or  the company  refer to American Assets Trust, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to  our Operating Partnership  or  the Operating Partnership  refer to American Assets Trust, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  American Assets Trust, Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.  As of   September 30, 2016  , American Assets Trust, Inc. owned an approximate   71.8%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The remaining   28.2%   partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our directors and executive officers.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies.   
    
  The company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership into a single report will result in the following benefits: 

better reflects how management and the analyst community view the business as a single operating unit; 
                
    enhance investors' understanding of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 
                
    greater efficiency for American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and resulting savings in time, effort and expense; and 
                
    greater efficiency for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure by providing a single document for their review. 
       
  Management operates American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise.  The management of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership are the same.   
    
  There are a few differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the disclosures in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in the context of how American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated consolidated company. American Assets Trust, Inc. is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.   As a result, American Assets Trust, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership.  American Assets Trust, Inc. itself does not hold any indebtedness.  The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the company, directly or indirectly holds the ownership interests in the company s real estate ventures, conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly-traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by American Assets Trust, Inc., which are generally contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of operating partnership units. 
    
  Noncontrolling interests and stockholders  equity and partners  capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of American Assets Trust, Inc. and those of American Assets Trust, L.P. The partnership interests in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by American Assets Trust, Inc. are accounted for as partners  capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in American Assets Trust, Inc. s financial statements. To help investors understand the significant differences between the company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership: 

consolidated financial statements;  
                
    the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
                
    Debt;  
                
    Equity/Partners' Capital; and 
                
    Earnings Per Share/Unit; and 
                
    Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

This report also includes separate Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of American Assets Trust, Inc. have made the requisite certifications and American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C.  1350.

  Business and Organization

Basis of Presentation 
  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, our Operating Partnership and our subsidiaries. The equity interests of other investors in our Operating Partnership are reflected as noncontrolling interests.  
  All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Operating Partnership have been prepared in accordance with the rules applicable to Form 10-Q and include all information and footnotes required for interim financial statement presentation, but do not include all disclosures required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise noted) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes therein included in the Company's and Operating Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using our best judgment, after considering past, current and expected events and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  Any reference to the number of properties, square footage, employee numbers or percentages of beneficial ownership of our shares are unaudited and outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s review of our financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Except for the adoption of the consolidation and debt issuance costs standards discussed below, there have been no changes to our significant accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Segment Information 
  Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our chief operating decision maker reviews information for operational decision-making purposes. We operate in   four   business segments: the acquisition, redevelopment, ownership and management of retail real estate, office real estate, multifamily real estate and mixed-use real estate. The products for our retail segment primarily include rental of retail space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental. The products for our office segment primarily include rental of office space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental. The products for our multifamily segment include rental of apartments and other tenant services. The products of our mixed-use segment include rental of retail space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental and operation of a   369  -room all-suite hotel.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    Update No. 2014-09 establishes that companies may recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an ASU that requires reporting entities to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  The ASU modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are voting interest entities ("VIEs") and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership.  This affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  A reporting entity may apply the amendments in the ASU using: (i) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (ii) by applying the amendments retrospectively.  We adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2016. The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest model entities.  The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model. Under the revised guidance, the Operating Partnership will be a variable interest entity of the Company and the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the balance sheets of the Company, the identification of this entity as a variable interest entity has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of this guidance.  In addition, there were no other voting interest entities under prior existing guidance determined to be variable interest entities under the revised guidance.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU that requires reporting entities to present debt issuance cost related to a note as a direct deduction from the face amount of that note presented in the balance sheet.  The ASU requires the amortization of debt issuance costs presented as interest expense.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  A reporting entity may apply the amendments in the ASU retrospectively to all prior periods.  We adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2016, resulting in the presentation of current period and prior period debt issuance costs associated with our secured notes payable, unsecured notes payable and unsecured line of credit as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt instrument.  These costs were previously included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. The accounting applied by lessors under this ASU is largely unchanged. Leases will be either classified as sales-type, finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The ASU also requires significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2. ACQUIRED IN-PLACE LEASES AND ABOVE/BELOW MARKET LEASES 
  The following summarizes our acquired lease intangibles and leasing costs, which are included in other assets and other liabilities and deferred credits, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  A fair value measurement is based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value is as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Level 1 Inputs quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
              2. 
    Level 2 Inputs observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
              3. 
    Level 3 Inputs unobservable inputs 
     Except as disclosed below, the carrying amounts of our financial instruments approximate their fair value. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
   We measure the fair value of our deferred compensation liability, which is included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet, on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs. We measure the fair value of this liability based on prices provided by independent market participants that are based on observable inputs using market-based valuation techniques. 
    
  The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are based on the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contract at the reporting date and are determined using interest rate pricing models and interest rate related observable inputs. The fair value of our swaps at   September 30, 2016   was a liability of   $13.1 million   and is included in "other liabilities and deferred credits" on our consolidated balance sheets. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the change in valuation on our interest rate swaps were gains of   $2.4 million   and losses of    $11.4 million  , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
    
  We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contract for the effect of non-performance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016   we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative position and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivative. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  A summary of our financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy is as follows (in thousands): 

The fair value of our secured notes payable and unsecured senior guaranteed notes are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. Discounted cash flow analysis using observable market interest rates (Level 2) is generally used to estimate the fair value of our secured notes payable, using rates ranging from   3.1%   to   5.6%  .  
  Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. The estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments. The carrying values of our revolving line of credit and term loan set forth below are deemed to be at fair value since the outstanding debt is directly tied to monthly LIBOR contracts. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of our secured financial instruments, all of which are based on Level 2 inputs, is as follows (in thousands):     

NOTE 4. DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
    
  Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  
       
  On January 29, 2016, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract with U.S. Bank National Association to reduce the interest rate variability exposure of the projected interest cash flows of our then prospective $100 million seven-year term loan.  The forward-starting   seven  -year swap contract had a notional amount of   $100 million  , a termination date of   March 1, 2023  , a fixed pay rate of   1.4485%  , and a receive rate equal to the one-month LIBOR, with fixed rate payments due monthly commencing April 1, 2016, floating payments due monthly commencing April 1, 2016, and floating reset dates two days prior to the first day of each calculation period.  The forward-starting seven-year swap contract accrual period,   March 1, 2016   to   March 1, 2023  , was designed to match the expected tenor of our then prospective   $100 million     seven  -year term loan, which successfully closed on March 1, 2016. 
    
  On March 23, 2016, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to reduce the interest rate variability exposure of the projected interest cash flows of our then prospective incremental $50 million seven-year term loan.  The forward-starting   seven  -year swap contract had a notional amount of   $50 million  , a termination date of   March 1, 2023  , a fixed pay rate of   1.4410%  , and a receive rate equal to the one-month LIBOR, with fixed rate payments due monthly commencing June 1, 2016, floating payments due monthly commencing June 1, 2016,

and floating reset dates two days prior to the first day of each calculation period.  The forward-starting seven-year swap contract accrual period,   May 2, 2016   to March 1, 2023, was designed to match the expected tenor of our then prospective incremental   $50 million     seven  -year term loan, which successfully closed on May 2, 2016.  
    
  On March 29, 2016, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to reduce the interest rate variability exposure of the projected interest cash flows of our prospective new ten-year debt offering (private placement, investment grade bonds, term loan or otherwise) (anticipated to close on or before   March 31, 2017  ).  The forward-starting   ten  -year swap contract had a notional amount of   $150 million  , a termination date of   March 31, 2027  , a fixed pay rate of   1.8800%  , and a receive rate equal to the three-month LIBOR, with fixed rate payments due semi-annually commencing September 29, 2017, floating payments due semi-annually commencing September 29, 2017, and floating reset dates the first day of each quarterly period.  The forward-starting ten-year swap contract accrual period, March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2027, was designed to match the expected tenor of the prospective debt offering.  There can be no assurances that the prospective debt offering described above will close on the terms described herein, or at all. 
    
  On April 7, 2016, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to reduce the interest rate variability exposure of the projected interest cash flows of our prospective new ten-year debt offering (private placement, investment grade bonds, term loan or otherwise) (anticipated to close on or before   March 31, 2017  ). The forward-starting   ten  -year swap contract had a notional amount of   $100 million  , a termination date of   March 31, 2027  , a fixed pay rate of   1.7480%  , and a receive rate equal to the three-month LIBOR, with fixed rate payments due semi-annually commencing September 29, 2017, floating payments due semi-annually commencing September 29, 2017, and floating reset dates the first day of each quarterly period. The forward-starting ten-year swap contract accrual period, March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2027, was designed to match the expected tenor of our prospective new   ten  -year debt offering (private placement, investment grade bonds, term loan or otherwise). There can be no assurances that the prospective debt offering described above will close on the terms described herein, or at all. 
    
  The forward-starting interest rate swap contracts have been deemed to be highly effective cash flow hedges and we elected to designate all the forward-starting swap contracts as accounting hedges. 
  The following is a summary of the terms of our interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
  The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and implied volatilities.  The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts).  The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.

Unsecured notes payable 
  The following is a summary of the Operating Partnership's total unsecured notes payable outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

(1) 
    The Operating Partnership has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is intended to fix the interest rate associated with Term Loan A at approximately   3.08%   through its maturity date and extension options, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated leverage ratio. 
              (2) 
    The Operating Partnership has an option to extend the term loan up to   two   times, with each such extension for a 12-month period. The foregoing extension options are exercisable by us subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
              (3) 
    The Operating Partnership entered into a one-month forward-starting   seven  -year swap contract on August 19, 2014, which was settled on September 19, 2014 at a gain of approximately   $1.6 million  . The forward-starting seven-year swap contract was deemed to be a highly effective cash flow hedge, accordingly, the effective interest rate is approximately   3.88%   per annum. 
              (4) 
    The Operating Partnership has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is intended to fix the interest rate associated with Term Loan B at approximately   3.15%   through its maturity date, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated leverage ratio. 
              (5) 
    The Operating Partnership has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is intended to fix the interest rate associated with Term Loan C at approximately   3.14%   through its maturity date, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated leverage ratio. 
       
  On March 1, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a Term Loan Agreement with each lender from time to time party thereto, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Administrative Agent (as amended, the  Term Loan Agreement ).  The Term Loan Agreement provides for a new,   seven  -year unsecured term loan to the Operating Partnership of   $100 million   that matures on   March 1, 2023   ( Term Loan B ).  Concurrent with the closing of the Term Loan Agreement, the Operating Partnership drew down the entirety of Term Loan B. 
    
  On May 2, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a Joinder and First Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement to  provide for a new lender to fund an incremental term loan.  The Joinder and First Amendment provides for a new,   seven  -year unsecured term loan to the Operating Partnership of   $50 million   that matures on   March 1, 2023   ("Term Loan C").  Term Loan C has the same borrowing terms as the Term Loan Agreement noted below. Concurrent with the closing of the Joinder and First Amendment, the Operating Partnership drew down the entirety of Term Loan C.  
    
  Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement with respect to Term Loan B and Term Loan C bear interest at floating rates equal to, at our option, either (1)   LIBOR  , plus a spread which ranges from   1.70%   to   2.35%   based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) a base rate equal to the highest of (a)   0%  , (b) the   prime rate  , (c) the   federal funds rate   plus 50 bps or (d) the   Eurodollar   rate plus 100 bps, in each case plus a spread which ranges from   0.70%   to   1.35%   based on our consolidated leverage ratio.  The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements intended to fix the interest rates associated with Term Loan B and Term Loan C at approximately   3.15%   and   3.14%  , respectively, through the maturity dates, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated leverage ratio.  
    
  The Term Loan Agreement contains a number of customary financial covenants, including, without limitation, tangible net worth thresholds, secured and unsecured leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. Subject to the terms of the Term Loan Agreement, upon certain events of default, including, but not limited to, (i) a default in the payment of any principal or interest under Term Loan B or Term Loan C, and (ii) a default in the payment of certain other indebtedness of the Operating Partnership, the Company or their subsidiaries, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment penalties on the

outstanding Term Loan B or Term Loan C will become due and payable at the option of the lenders.          
  The Operating Partnership s obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are initially fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.           
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership was in compliance with the Term Loan Agreement's financial covenants. 
    
  Credit Facility 
  On January 9, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Facility") which amended and restated the then in-place credit facility.  The Amended and Restated Credit Facility provides for aggregate, unsecured borrowing of   $350 million  , consisting of a revolving line of credit of   $250 million   ("Revolver Loan") and a term loan of   $100 million   ("Term Loan A"). The Amended and Restated Credit Facility has an accordion feature that may allow the Operating Partnership to increase the availability thereunder up to an additional   $250 million  , subject to meeting specified requirements and obtaining additional commitments from lenders. At   September 30, 2016  , there was   no   outstanding balance under the Revolver Loan.  
  Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility initially bear interest at floating rates equal to, at our option, either (1)   LIBOR  , plus a spread which ranges from (a)   1.35%  -  1.95%   (with respect to the Revolver Loan) and (b)   1.30%   to   1.90%   (with respect to Term Loan A), in each case based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) a   base rate   equal to the highest of (a) the   prime rate  , (b) the   federal funds rate   plus 50 bps or (c) the   Eurodollar   rate plus 100 bps, plus a spread which ranges from (i)   0.35%  -  0.95%   (with respect to the Revolver Loan) and (ii)   0.30%   to   0.90%   (with respect to Term Loan A), in each case based on our consolidated leverage ratio.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on the Revolver Loan was   1.77%  .  
  The Revolver Loan initially matures on January 9, 2018, subject to the Operating Partnership's option to extend the Revolver Loan up to   two   times, with each such extension for a   six  -month period. Term Loan A initially matures on January 9, 2016, subject to the Operating Partnership's option to extend Term Loan A up to   three   times, with each such extension for a   12  -month period. The foregoing extension options are exercisable by the Operating Partnership subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.  Effective as of January 8, 2016, the Operating Partnership exercised the first of three options to extend the maturity date of Term Loan A to January 9, 2017. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership was in compliance with the Amended and Restated Credit Facility financial covenants. 
   
  NOTE 8. PARTNERS' CAPITAL OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, L.P. 
  Noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership are interests in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by us. Noncontrolling interests consisted of   17,888,822   common units (the  noncontrolling common units ), and represented approximately   28.2%   of the ownership interests in our Operating Partnership at   September 30, 2016  . Common units and shares of our common stock have essentially the same economic characteristics in that common units and shares of our common stock share equally in the total net income or loss distributions of our Operating Partnership. Investors who own common units have the right to cause our Operating Partnership to redeem any or all of their common units for cash equal to the then-current market value of one share of our common stock, or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   10,694   common units were converted into shares of our common stock.  
  Earnings Per Unit of the Operating Partnership 
  Basic earnings (loss) per unit ( EPU ) of the Operating Partnership is computed by dividing income (loss) applicable to unitholders by the weighted average Operating Partnership units outstanding, as adjusted for the effect of participating securities. Operating Partnership units granted in equity-based payment transactions that have non-forfeitable dividend equivalent rights are considered participating securities prior to vesting. The impact of unvested Operating Partnership unit awards on EPU has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested Operating

Partnership unit awards based on distributions and the unvested Operating Partnership units  participation rights in undistributed earnings (losses). 
  The calculation of diluted earnings per unit for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   does not include the weighted average of   169,963   and   168,529   unvested Operating Partnership units, respectively, as these equity securities are either considered contingently issuable or the effect of including these equity securities was anti-dilutive to income from continuing operations and net income attributable to the unitholders. The calculation of diluted earnings per unit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   does  not include the weighted average of   171,760    and   196,927   unvested Operating Partnership units, respectively. 
   
  NOTE 9. EQUITY OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. 
  Stockholders' Equity 
  On May 27, 2015, we entered into an at-the-market ("ATM") equity program with   five   sales agents in which we may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to   $250.0 million  .  The sales of shares of our common stock made through the ATM equity program are made in "at-the-market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the following shares of common stock were sold through the ATM equity programs (in thousands, except per share data and share amounts): 

We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM equity program to fund our development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our revolving line of credit or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the capacity to issue up to an additional   $206.6 million   in shares of our common stock under our ATM equity program.  Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs.  We have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the ATM equity program. 
  Dividends 
  The following table lists the dividends declared and paid on our shares of common stock and noncontrolling common units during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :    

Taxability of Dividends 
  Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders and holders of common units, may differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of revenue recognition and compensation expense and in the basis of depreciable assets and estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation.

Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  We follow the FASB guidance related to stock compensation which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans, including all arrangements by which employees receive shares of stock or other equity instruments of the employer, or the employer incurs liabilities to employees in amounts based on the price of the employer's stock.  The guidance also defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. 
    
  In addition, on the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, each non-employee director who continues to serve on our board of directors (the "Board") following such annual meeting will be granted restricted shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "2011 Plan"). On June 14, 2016, we awarded a total of   4,900   shares of restricted common stock pursuant to our 2011 Plan to our non-employee directors. These awards of restricted stock will vest subject to the director's continued service on the Board on the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the date of grant or (ii) the date of the next annual meeting of our stockholders, if such non-employee director continues his or her service on the Board until the next annual meeting of stockholders, but not thereafter, pursuant to our independent director compensation policy. 
  For the performance-based stock awards, the fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. Our stock price, along with the stock prices of a group of peer REITs, is assumed to follow the Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion Process. Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion is a common assumption when modeling in financial markets, as it allows the modeled quantity (in this case, the stock price) to vary randomly from its current value and take any value greater than zero.  The volatilities of the returns on the stock price of the Company and the group of REITs were estimated based on a three year look-back period. The expected growth rate of the stock prices over the  derived service period  of the employee is determined with consideration of the risk free rate as of the grant date.  
  The following table summarizes the activity of restricted stock awards during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

We recognize noncash compensation expense ratably over the vesting period, and accordingly, we recognized   $0.6 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, in noncash compensation expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  We recognized   $1.9 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, in noncash compensation expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Unrecognized compensation expense was   $1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Earnings Per Share 
  We have calculated earnings per share ( EPS ) under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby EPS for each class of common stock and participating security is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The weighted average unvested shares outstanding, which are considered participating securities, were   169,963   and   168,529   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   171,760   and   196,927   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Therefore, we have allocated our earnings for basic and diluted EPS between common shares and unvested shares as these unvested shares have nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights.  
  Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive instruments outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable. Additionally, the unvested restricted stock awards subject to time vesting are anti-dilutive for all periods presented, and accordingly, have been excluded from the weighted average common shares used to compute diluted EPS.

NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES 
  We elected to be taxed as a REIT and operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our initial taxable year.  As a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders that we derive from our REIT qualifying activities. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through our TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. 
  We lease our hotel property to a wholly owned TRS that is subject to federal and state income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between GAAP carrying amounts and their respective tax bases.  Additionally, we classify certain state taxes as income taxes for financial reporting purposes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.  
  A deferred tax liability of   $0.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is included in our consolidated balance sheets in relation to real estate asset basis differences of property subject to the Texas margin tax and certain prepaid expenses of our TRS.    
  Income tax expense is recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  For each of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded income tax expense of   $0.6 million  . For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded income tax expense of   $0.4 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. 
   
  NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Legal 
  We are sometimes involved in various disputes, lawsuits, warranty claims, environmental and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters.

We are currently a party to various legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, we accrue the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum within the range is accrued. Legal fees related to litigation are expensed as incurred. We do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations; however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Also, under our leases, tenants are typically obligated to indemnify us from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses imposed upon or asserted against us as owner of the properties due to certain matters relating to the operation of the properties by the tenant. 
  Commitments 
  At The Landmark at One Market, we lease (the "Annex Lease"), as lessee, a building adjacent to The Landmark under an operating lease effective through June 30, 2021, which we have the option to extend until 2031 by way of   two     five  -year extension options. 
  At Waikiki Beach Walk, we sublease (the "FHB Sublease") a portion of the building of which Quiksilver is currently in possession, under an operating lease effective through December 31, 2021, which we have the option to extend at fair rental value in the event the sublessor extends its lease for the space with the master landlord. The lease payments under the FHB Sublease will increase by approximately   3.4%   annually through 2017 and, thereafter, will be equal to fair rental value, as defined in the FHB Sublease, through lease expiration. 
  Current minimum annual payments under the leases are as follows, as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):    

(1) 
    Lease payments on the FHB Sublease will be equal to fair rental value from March 2017 through the end of the lease term. In the table, we have shown the lease payments for this period based on the stated rate for the month of February 2017 of   $61,690  . 
              (2) 
    Lease payments on the Annex Lease will be equal to fair rental value from July 2021 through the end of the options lease term. In the table, we have shown the option lease payments for this period based on the stated rate for the month of June 2021 of   $217,744  . 
       
  We have management agreements with Outrigger Hotels   Resorts or an affiliate thereof ( Outrigger ) pursuant to which Outrigger manages each of the retail and hotel portions of the Waikiki Beach Walk property. Under the management agreement with Outrigger relating to the retail portion of Waikiki Beach Walk (the  retail management agreement ), we pay Outrigger a monthly management fee of   3.0%   of net revenues from the retail portion of Waikiki Beach Walk. Pursuant to the terms of the retail management agreement, if the agreement is terminated in certain instances, including our election not to repair damage or destruction at the property, a condemnation or our failure to make required working capital infusions, we would be obligated to pay Outrigger a termination fee equal to the sum of the management fees paid for the   two   calendar months immediately preceding the termination date. The retail management agreement may not be terminated by us or by Outrigger without cause. Under our management agreement with Outrigger relating to the hotel portion of Waikiki Beach Walk (the  hotel management agreement ), we pay Outrigger a monthly management fee of   6.0%   of the hotel's gross operating profit, as well as   3.0%   of the hotel's gross revenues; provided that the aggregate management fee payable to Outrigger for any year shall not exceed   3.5%   of the hotel's gross revenues for such fiscal year. Pursuant to the terms of the hotel management agreement, if the agreement is terminated in certain instances, including upon a transfer by us of the hotel or upon a default by us under the hotel management agreement, we would be required to pay a cancellation fee calculated by multiplying (1) the management fees for the previous   12 months   by (2) (a)   eight  , if the agreement is terminated in the first   11   years of its term, or (b)   four  ,   three  ,   two   or   one  , if the agreement is terminated in the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth or fifteenth year, respectively, of its term. The hotel management agreement may not be terminated by us or by Outrigger without cause.

A wholly owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, WBW Hotel Lessee LLC, entered into a franchise license agreement with Embassy Suites Franchise LLC, the franchisor of the brand  Embassy Suites ,  to obtain the non-exclusive right to operate the hotel under the Embassy Suites   TM    brand for   20   years. The franchise license agreement provides that WBW Hotel Lessee LLC must comply with certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures. In connection with this agreement, we are also subject to the terms of a product improvement plan pursuant to which we expect to undertake certain actions to ensure that our hotel's infrastructure is maintained in compliance with the franchisor's brand standards. In addition, we must pay to Embassy Suites Franchise LLC a monthly franchise royalty fee equal to   4.0%   of the hotel's gross room revenue through December 2021 and   5.0%   of the hotel's gross room revenue thereafter, as well as a monthly program fee equal to   4.0%   of the hotel's gross room revenue. If the franchise license is terminated due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we may be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment, which could be as high as   $7.2 million   based on operating performance through   September 30, 2016  . 
  Our Del Monte Center property has ongoing environmental remediation related to ground water contamination. The environmental issue existed at purchase and remains in remediation. The final stages of the remediation will include routine, long term ground monitoring by the appropriate regulatory agency over the next   five   to   seven   years. The work performed is financed through an escrow account funded by the seller upon purchase of the Del Monte Center. We believe the funds in the escrow account are sufficient for the remaining work to be performed. However, if further work is required costing more than the remaining escrow funds, we could be required to pay such overage, although we may have a contractual claim for such costs against the prior owner or our environmental remediation consultant. 
  In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into tax protection agreements with certain limited partners of our Operating Partnership.  These agreements provide that if we dispose of any interest with respect to Carmel Country Plaza, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Loma Palisades, Lomas Santa Fe Plaza, Waikele Center or the Torrey Plaza (formerly ICW Plaza) portion of Torrey Reserve Campus, in a taxable transaction during the period from the closing of our initial public offering through January 19, 2018, we will indemnify such limited partners for their tax liabilities attributable to their share of the built-in gain that existed with respect to such property interest as of the time of our initial public offering and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment.  Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the indemnification rights will terminate for any such protected partner that sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of more than   50%   of his or her common units. We have no present intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the properties or interest therein in taxable transactions during the restriction period. If we were to trigger the tax protection provisions under these agreements, we would be required to pay damages in the amount of the taxes owed by these limited partners (plus additional damages in the amount of the taxes incurred as a result of such payment).  
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Our properties are located in Southern California, Northern California, Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. The ability of the tenants to honor the terms of their respective leases is dependent upon the economic, regulatory and social factors affecting the markets in which the tenants operate.   Eleven   of our consolidated properties are located in Southern California, which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Tenants in the retail industry accounted for   34.0%   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This makes us susceptible to demand for retail rental space and subject to the risks associated with an investment in real estate with a concentration of tenants in the retail industry. Furthermore, tenants in the office industry accounted for   35.0%   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This makes us susceptible to demand for office rental space and subject to the risks associated with an investment in real estate with a concentration of tenants in the office industry. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no tenant accounted for more than   10%   of our total rental revenue.

NOTE 12. OPERATING LEASES 
  Our leases with office, retail, mixed-use and residential tenants are classified as operating leases. Leases at our office and retail properties and the retail portion of our mixed-use property generally range from   three   to   ten   years (certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and in addition to minimum rents, usually provide for cost recoveries for the tenant s share of certain operating costs and also may include percentage rents based on the tenant s level of sales achieved. Leases on apartments generally range from   7   to   15 months  , with a majority having   12  -month lease terms. Rooms at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property are rented on a nightly basis. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , minimum future rentals from noncancelable operating leases, before any reserve for uncollectible amounts and assuming no early lease terminations, at our office and retail properties and the retail portion of our mixed-use property are as follows (in thousands): 

The above future minimum rentals exclude residential leases, which typically have a term of   12   months or less, and exclude the hotel, as rooms are rented on a nightly basis. 
   
  NOTE 13. COMPONENTS OF RENTAL INCOME AND EXPENSE 
  The principal components of rental income are as follows (in thousands):  

Minimum rents include   $(0.3) million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $(0.3) million   and   $2.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to recognize minimum rents on a straight-line basis. In addition, net amortization of above and below market leases included in minimum rents were   $0.9 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2.6 million   and   $2.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  At Torrey Plaza, we lease space to Insurance Company of the West, a California corporation ("ICW"), which is an insurance company majority owned and controlled by Ernest Rady, our Executive Chairman of the Board.  Rental revenue recognized on the leases of   $1.6 million   for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is included in rental income.  Additionally, we maintain a workers' compensation insurance policy with ICW, which was renewed on July 1, 2015 and the premium is approximately   $0.2 million   for the period July 1, 2015 through July 1, 2016. We renewed this policy with ICW on July 1, 2016 and the premium is approximately   $0.2 million   for the period July 1, 2016 through July 1, 2017. 
  The Waikiki Beach Walk entities have a   47.7%   investment in WBW CHP LLC, an entity that was formed to, among other things, construct a chilled water plant to provide air conditioning to the property and other adjacent facilities. The operating expenses of WBW CHP LLC are recovered through reimbursements from its members, and reimbursements to WBW CHP LLC of   $0.7 million   for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is included in rental expenses on the statements of comprehensive income. 
  On occasion, the company utilizes aircraft services provided by AAI Aviation, Inc. ("AAIA"), an entity owned and controlled by Ernest Rady.  For each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred approximately   $0.1 million   of expenses related to aircraft services of AAIA or reimbursement to Mr. Rady (or the Ernest Rady Trust U/D/T Martch 13, 1983) for use of the aircraft owned by AAIA. These expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

NOTE 16. SEGMENT REPORTING 
  Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews information for operational decision-making purposes. We operate in   four   business segments: the acquisition, redevelopment, ownership and management of retail real estate, office real estate, multifamily real estate and mixed-use real estate. The products for our retail segment primarily include rental of retail space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental. The products for our office segment primarily include rental of office space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental. The products for our multifamily segment include rental of apartments and other tenant services. The products of our mixed-use segment include rental of retail space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental and operation of a   369  -room all-suite hotel. 
  We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit, which is defined as property revenue less property expenses. We do not use asset information as a measure to assess performance and make decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. General and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other income and expense are not included in segment profit as our internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level. 
  Segment profit is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP, and it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Not all companies calculate segment profit in the same manner. We consider segment profit to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it assists both investors and management in understanding the core operations of our properties.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this report that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Likewise, all of our statements regarding anticipated growth in our funds from operations and anticipated market conditions, demographics and results of operations are forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   should,   seeks,   approximately,   intends,   plans,   pro forma,   estimates  or  anticipates  or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters.

  Overview 
  References to  we,   our,   us  and  our company  refer to American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which we are the sole general partner and which we refer to in this report as our Operating Partnership. 
  We are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Texas and Hawaii. As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was comprised of   eleven   retail shopping centers;   seven   office properties; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and   five   multifamily properties. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned land at four of our properties that we classified as held for development and/or construction in progress.  Our core markets include San Diego; the San Francisco Bay Area; Portland, Oregon; Bellevue, Washington; and Oahu, Hawaii. We are a Maryland corporation formed on July 16, 2010 to acquire the entities owning various controlling and noncontrolling interests in real estate assets owned and/or managed by Ernest S. Rady or his affiliates, including the Ernest Rady Trust U/D/T March 13, 1983, or the Rady Trust, and did not have any operating activity until the consummation of our initial public offering on January 19, 2011.  Our Company, as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned   71.8%   of our Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  We identified certain critical accounting policies that affect certain of our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this report. 

Same-store 
    
  We have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations.  Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared.  Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be important measures because they assist in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable.  Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance. 
  While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties into same-store properties once they are stabilized.  Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate.  We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Our evaluation of significant impact related to development, redevelopment or expansion activity is based on quantitative and qualitative measures including, but not limited to the following: the total budgeted cost of planned construction activity compared to the property s  annualized base rent, occupancy and property operating income within the calendar year; percentage of development, redevelopment or expansion square footage to total property square footage; and the ability to maintain historic occupancy and rental rates. In consideration of these measures, we generally remove properties from same-store properties when we see a decline in a property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year as a direct result of ongoing redevelopment, development or expansion activity. Acquired properties are classified  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

into same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion.  
    
  In our determination of same-store and redevelopment same-store properties, Lloyd District Portfolio and Torrey Reserve Campus have been identified as same-store redevelopment properties due to the significant construction activity.  Office same-store net operating income decreased approximately   0.9%   and increased approximately   2.6%  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Office redevelopment same-store net operating income decreased approximately   0.8%   and increased approximately   2.7%  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Below is a summary of our same-store composition for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Two completed development properties, Hassalo on Eighth - Multifamily and Hassalo on Eighth - Retail, were included in non-same store properties when compared to the designations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  One development property, Torrey Reserve Land, was removed from development properties when compared to the designations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to completion of all Torrey Reserve Campus development during the second quarter of 2016. 

Outlook 
    
  We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. 
    
  We continue our development efforts at Torrey Point (previously Sorrento Pointe) with planned construction to increase rentable office space by approximately   88,000   square feet.  Construction of the project is expected to be completed in   2017  , with an expected stabilization date in   2018  .  Projected costs of the development are approximately   $53 million  , of which approximately   $27 million   has been incurred to date. We expect the Torrey Point redevelopment to be stabilized in   2018   with an estimated stabilized yield of approximately 7.5% to 8.6%, based on initial estimates.  
    
  We intend to opportunistically pursue the development of future phases of Lloyd District Portfolio and Torrey Point based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk-adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition.   
    
  We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent upon our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.

Leasing 
    
  Our same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. We have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants, as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our spaces. While there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years. We believe the locations of our properties and diverse tenant base mitigate the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment.  However, any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we signed   24   retail leases for a total of   103,348   square feet of retail space including   98,723   square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), at an average rental rate increase of   13.3%   on a cash basis and an increase of   18.2%   on a straight-line basis. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for   47,066   square feet at an average rental rate increase of   27.6%   on a cash basis and   30.4%   on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for   51,657   square feet at an average rental rate increase of   6.5%   on a cash basis and   12.3%   on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were   $41.94   per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Tenant improvements and incentives for comparable new leases is mainly attributed to tenants at Carmel Mountain Plaza and Alamo Quarry Market. 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we signed   15   office leases for a total of   47,637   square feet of office space including   38,822   square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of   9.6%   on a cash basis and average rental increase of   16.8%   on a straight-line basis. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for   10,953   square feet at an average rental rate increase of   12.6%   on a cash basis and   13.5%   on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for   27,869   square feet at an average rental rate increase of   8.4%   on a cash basis and   18.2%   on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were   $6.73   per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , mainly attributed to tenants at City Center Bellevue and Lloyd District Portfolio.  Tenant improvements and incentives were   $23.53   per square foot of office space for comparable recurring leases for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , mainly attributed to tenants at Torrey Reserve Campus. 
    
  The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base-building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.  
    
  The leases signed in   2016   generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2017 and beyond. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time.  
    
  Through the remainder of   2016  , we believe our leasing volume will be in-line with our historical averages and result in overall positive increases in rental income. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels, if at all.

Capitalized Costs 
    
  Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized.  We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy.  The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment.  We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction. 
    
  We capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of   $6.2 million   and   $16.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of   $24.7 million   and   $87.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
  We capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of   $8.6 million   and   $5.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of   $20.4 million   and   $18.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  We capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities and other property improvements of   $0.04 million   and   $0.08 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities and other property improvements of   $0.14 million   and   $0.22 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, however, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to development activities of   $0.3 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We capitalized interest costs related to development activities of   $1.2 million   and   $7.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  Other 
  General and Administrative.   General and administrative expenses decreased   $1.8 million  , or   29%  , to   $4.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense during the period due to lower valuations assigned to 2015 stock awards and business transition costs incurred during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the resignation of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, John W. Chamberlain. 
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $2.2 million  , or   14%  , to   $18.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization attributable to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.  The increase is also attributed to additional depreciation related to the shared Hassalo on Eighth parking garage, which was placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased   $1.8 million  , or   16%  , to   $13.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, in that capitalization of interest costs ceased when the buildings were placed into service.  
  Gain on sale of real estate.    Gain on sale of real estate of $7.1 million relates to the sale of Rancho Carmel Plaza on August 2, 2015.  
  Other Expense, Net.   Other expense, net increased   $0.2 million  , or   66%  , to   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increases in income tax expense attributed to an increase in revenue in Oregon associated to the lease up of Hassalo on Eighth and an increase in hotel revenue during 2016.

Multifamily other property income increased   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings, which became available for occupancy during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and had incremental other property income of approximately $0.6 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Property Expenses 
  Total Property Expenses.   Total property expenses consist of rental expenses and real estate taxes. Total property expenses   increased   by   $7.6 million  , or   11%  , to   $79.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $71.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   increase   in total property expenses was attributable primarily to the factors discussed below  . 
  Rental Expenses.   Rental expenses   increased     $5.8 million  , or   11%  , to   $58.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $52.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Rental expense by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):    

Retail rental expenses increased   $1.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense for Waikele Center related to the Sports Authority bankruptcy and announcement of its K-Mart store closure.  
  Office rental expenses increased   $1.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in rent expense for the Annex Lease at The Landmark at One Market, which was extended during the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase in parking lot expenses at Lloyd District Portfolio and an increase in repair and maintenance expenses among our office properties during the period.  
  Multifamily rental expenses increased   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings, which became available for occupancy during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and had rental expenses of approximately $3.2 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Mixed-use rental expenses increased   $0.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in the room tax expense, which was attributed to the increase in payroll and complimentary amenity costs at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense related to the Quiksilver bankruptcy in 2015. 
  Real Estate Taxes.   Real estate tax expense   increased     $1.7 million  , or   9%  , to   $20.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $18.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Real estate tax expense by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):

Retail real estate taxes decreased   $0.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to a decrease in the assessed value of  Alamo Quarry Market offset by higher assessments at Waikele Center. 
  Office real estate taxes increased   $1.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes at First   Main and One Beach Street due to decreases in property tax exemptions for certain tenants. The increase is also attributed to completion of redevelopment activity at Torrey Reserve Campus, for which real estate taxes were capitalized in the prior year during the construction period. 
  Multifamily real estate taxes increased   $0.4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings, which became available for occupancy during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and had incremental real estate taxes of approximately $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
  Mixed-use real estate taxes increased   $0.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes for the hotel portion of our mixed-use property that are assessed annually based on the hotel's room rates, which have increased from the prior year.  
  Property Operating Income 
  Property operating income   increased     $6.9 million  , or   5%  , to   $139.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $132.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Property operating income by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Retail property operating income decreased   $0.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense for Waikele Center related to the Sports Authority bankruptcy and the announcement of its K-Mart store closure. 
  Office property operating income increased   $1.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to higher annualized base rents and additional cost reimbursements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Multifamily property operating income increased   $3.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and higher average base rent for same-store properties for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Mixed-use property operating income increased   $1.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher revenue per available room for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other 
  General and Administrative.   General and administrative expenses decreased   $2.7 million  , or   17%  , to   $13.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $16.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense during the period due to lower valuations assigned to the 2015 stock awards and the final vesting of initial public offering awards during the first quarter of 2015 and business transition costs incurred during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the resignation of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, John W. Chamberlain. 
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $7.0 million  , or   15%  , to   $53.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $46.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This

increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization attributable to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. The increase is also attributed to additional depreciation related to the shared Hassalo on Eighth parking garage, which was placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased   $4.9 million  , or   14%  , to   $39.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $34.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to the completion of the Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, in that capitalization of interest costs ceased when the buildings were placed into service.  
  Gain on sale of real estate.    Gain on sale of real estate of $7.1 million relates to the sale of Rancho Carmel Plaza on August 2, 2015.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. 
    
  In this  Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.  section, the term the  company  refers only to American Assets Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries.  
    
  The company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the company is the parent company and sole general partner, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes.  Because the company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled  Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.  should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole. 
    
  The company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The company itself does not have any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.  However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the company owned an approximate   71.8%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The remaining   28.2%   are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of the company's directors and executive officers.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies.  The company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. 
    
  The liquidity of the company is dependent on the Operating Partnership s ability to make sufficient distributions to the company. The primary cash requirement of the company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership s debt, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the company s guarantee obligations, then the company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the company s only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
    
  We believe the Operating Partnership s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured line of credit, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and, in turn, for the company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. As of   September 30, 2016  , the company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next 12 months.  However, we cannot assure you that the Operating Partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership s ability to pay its distributions to the company, which would in turn, adversely affect the company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 
    
  Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to the company s stockholders, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, interest expense  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, funding construction projects, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. 
    
  The company may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem the Operating Partnership s outstanding debt, the company s shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
    
  For the company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. While historically the company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the company s own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. The company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership s working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.  Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, the company may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce the Operating Partnership s operating expenditures, or re-evaluate its dividend policy. 
    
  The company is a well-known seasoned issuer. As circumstances warrant, the company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. When the company receives proceeds from preferred or common equity issuances, it is required by the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, to develop new or existing properties, to acquire properties or for general corporate purposes. 
  In February 2015, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was deemed automatically effective and which provides for the registration of unspecified amounts of securities.  However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.  Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others. 
  In May 2015, we entered into an ATM equity program with five sales agents in which we may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. The sales of shares of the company's common stock made through the ATM equity program are made in  at-the-market  offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the capacity to issue up to an additional   $206.6 million   in shares of common stock under the ATM equity program.  We intend to use the net proceeds to fund development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our amended and restated credit facility or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the company's capital needs. We have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the ATM equity program. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. 
    
  In this  Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.  section, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Operating Partnership and American Assets Trust, Inc. together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. American Assets Trust, Inc. is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with American Assets Trust, Inc., the section entitled  Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.  should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. 
  Due to the nature of our business, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is used for the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders and our unitholders. As a REIT, American Assets Trust, Inc. must generally make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of our net taxable income. As of   September 30, 2016  , we held   $62.0 million   in cash and cash equivalents. 
  Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, regular debt service requirements, dividend payments to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to our unitholders, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, borrowings available under our credit facility. 
  Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements to pay scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and capital improvements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and, if necessary, the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and capital improvements using our amended and restated credit facility pending permanent financing. We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. 
  Our overall capital requirements for the remainder of 2016 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of Torrey Point. Construction at Torrey Point is in process and is expected to be complete in   2017  , which will result in approximately   88,000   additional square feet of office space.  We expect to invest approximately   $53 million   related to Torrey Point, of which approximately   $27 million   has been incurred as of   September 30, 2016  . Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and/or our revolving line of credit.  On a long-term basis, our capital investments may be funded with additional long-term debt. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders.  Our capital investments may also be funded by additional equity including shares issued by American Assets Trust, Inc. under its ATM equity program.  Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy. 
  In February 2015, the Operating Partnership filed a universal shelf registration on Form S-3 with the SEC which provided for the registration of an unspecified amount of debt securities by the Operating Partnership.  However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership will be able to complete any such offerings of debt securities.  Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others.  
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

  Cash Flows 
  Comparison of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $62.0 million   and   $40.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   increased     $12.7 million   to   $102.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $90.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in cash from operations was primarily due to higher net income before certain non-cash items.   
  Net cash used in investing activities   decreased     $71.9 million   to   $47.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $119.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to completion of development activity at Torrey Reserve Campus during the second quarter of 2015 and Hassalo on Eighth multifamily buildings during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.  
  Net cash used by financing activities increased   $43.4 million   to cash used of   $33.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to cash provided of   $9.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease of cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to fewer sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM program during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The decrease was also attributed to the payments made on our Revolver Loan during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Net Operating Income  
  Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance).  NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expense, other nonproperty income and losses, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions.  Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to the NOIs of other REITs. 
  NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds of the property owner, (2) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (3) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is intended to be captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
  However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.  
  NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.     
  The following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   computed in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):

Funds from Operations 
  We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real-estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.   
  FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real-estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.  
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our FFO for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent (in thousands, except per share and share data):    

(1) 
    The weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted share include unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to time vesting, which were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS, as the vesting of the restricted stock awards is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the period. Diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.  We manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating, investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments, dividends to our stockholders and Operating Partnership unitholders, investments, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Outstanding Debt 
  The following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on the fair value of our total outstanding debt. Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. 
  Fixed Interest Rate Debt 
  Our outstanding notes payable obligations (maturing at various times through April 2025) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $820.5 million   of fixed rate debt outstanding with an estimated fair value of   $859.8 million  . The carrying values of our revolving line of credit and term loan are deemed to be at fair value since the outstanding debt is directly tied to monthly LIBOR contracts. Additionally, we consider our $250.0 million term loan outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   to be fixed rate debt as the rate is effectively fixed by an interest rate swap agreement. If interest rates at   September 30, 2016   had been 1.0% higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately   $31.7 million  . If interest rates at   September 30, 2016   had been 1.0% lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately   $33.9 million  . 
  Variable Interest Rate Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had $250.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding. We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in order to economically hedge against the risk of rising interest rates that would affect our interest expense related to our future anticipated debt issuances as part of its overall borrowing program. See the discussion under Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest rate swaps and for a discussion on how we value derivative financial instruments.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us. We may be subject to on-going litigation, relating to our portfolio and the properties comprising our portfolio, and we expect to otherwise be party from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.  
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , other than as set forth below. 
  The results of the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. 
  On June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum.  The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process.  Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the United Kingdom to preserve their place in the European Union by separating from the United Kingdom, as well as for the governments of other EU member states to consider withdrawal. 
  These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets.
