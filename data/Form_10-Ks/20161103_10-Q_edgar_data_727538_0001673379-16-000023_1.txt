APACHE OFFSHORE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
  Apache Offshore Investment Partnership, a Delaware general partnership (the Investment Partnership), was formed on October 31, 1983, consisting of Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Apache or the Managing Partner), as Managing Partner and public investors (the Investing Partners). The Investment Partnership invested its entire capital in Apache Offshore Petroleum Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). The primary business of the Investment Partnership is to serve as the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of both the Investment Partnership and the Operating Partnership. The term  Partnership , as used herein, refers to the Investment Partnership or the Operating Partnership, as the case may be. 
  These financial statements have been prepared by the Partnership, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods, on a basis consistent with the annual audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Partnership believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which contains a summary of the Partnership s significant accounting policies and other disclosures. 

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership s significant accounting policies are consistent with those discussed in Note 2 of its consolidated financial statements contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom and the assessment of asset retirement obligations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Oil and Gas Property 
  The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, all costs incurred for both successful and unsuccessful exploration and development activities, and oil and gas property acquisitions are capitalized. The net book value of oil and gas properties may not exceed a calculated  ceiling.  The ceiling limitation is the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent per annum. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. For a discussion of the calculation of estimated future net cash flows, please refer to Note 10-Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Any excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as  Additional depreciation, depletion and amortization  in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. Such limitations are tested quarterly. The Partnership recorded non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties totaling   $209,027   during the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $2,873,180   during the first   nine   months of   2016  .

New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 seeks to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-15 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its statement of consolidated cash flows. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses."  The standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year.  The Partnership does not expect to adopt the guidance early. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Partnership is evaluating the new guidance and does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a new lease standard requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Partnership will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a joint revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09. The new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards, changes the way companies recognize revenue from contracts with customers, and increases disclosure requirements. The guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which provides further clarification on the principal versus agent evaluation. The guidance is effective for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2017. The standard is required to be adopted using either the full retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented adjusted, or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet. The Partnership is currently evaluating the level of effort needed to implement the standard, the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements, and whether to use the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. 

2.    RECEIVABLE FROM / PAYABLE TO APACHE CORPORATION 
  The receivable from/payable to Apache represents the net result of the Investing Partners  revenue received and expenditures paid in the current month. Generally, cash in this amount will be paid by Apache to the Partnership or transferred to Apache in the month after the Partnership s transactions are processed and the net results of operations are determined. 

3.    RIGHT OF PRESENTMENT 
  As provided in the Partnership Agreement, as amended (the  Amended Partnership Agreement ), a first right of presentment valuation was computed during the first quarter of   2016  . The per-unit value was determined to be $  6,057   based on the valuation date of   December 31, 2015  . A second right of presentment valuation was computed during October 2016 and the per-unit value was determined to be $  6,091   based on a valuation date of June 30, 2016. The Partnership did not repurchase any Investing Partner Units (Units) during the first   nine   months of   2016  , and is not expected to purchase any Units in the fourth quarter of 2016. The per-unit right of presentment value computed during the first quarter of   2015   was determined to be $  9,765   based on the valuation date of   December 31, 2014  , and the second per-unit right of presentment in 2015 was $  9,831   based on a valuation date of June 30, 2015. The Partnership did not repurchase any Units during the first   nine   months of   2015  . Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has no obligation to purchase any Units presented to the extent it determines that it has insufficient funds for such purchases.

4.    ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
  The following table describes the changes to the Partnership s asset retirement obligation liability for the first   nine   months of   2016  : 

5.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Certain assets     and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the Partnership s consolidated balance sheet. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amounts of the Partnership s current assets and current liabilities approximated fair value because of the short-term nature or maturity of these instruments. 
  The Partnership did not use derivative financial instruments or otherwise engage in hedging activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  .

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion relates to Apache Offshore Investment Partnership (the Partnership) and should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Part I, Item 1,  Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as its consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Partnership s business is participation in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lease tracts in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and Texas. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Net Income and Revenue 
  The Partnership reported a net loss of $240,170 ($248 per Limited Partner Unit) for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a net loss of $136,865 ($132 per Limited Partner Unit) in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The loss for the third quarter of 2016 included a $0.2 million non-cash write-down in the carrying value of the Partnership's oil and gas properties and reduced revenues as a result of lower oil prices and production compared to the prior year.  Earnings for the third quarter of 2015 were reduced by $82,640 for a gas balancing settlement with the operator of North Padre Island 969 for gas volumes delivered in excess of its ownership interest entitlement. 
  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Partnership reported a net loss of $3.1 million ($3,075 per Limited Partner Unit) compared to a net loss of $122,696 ($165 loss per Limited Partner Unit) in the comparable period of   2015  . The 2016 loss included $2.9 million of non-cash write-downs in the carrying value of the Partnership's oil and gas properties and reduced revenues as a result of lower oil and gas prices compared to the prior year. 
   
  Total revenues in the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased   4   percent from the   third   quarter of   2015   on lower oil prices and production in 2016.  As noted in the table below, oil prices in the quarter declined   18   percent and oil production declined   14   percent from a year ago. Total revenues in the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased   23   percent from the first   nine   months of   2015   on lower oil, gas, and NGL prices in 2016.  Revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 were reduced by the gas balancing provision recognized for North Padre Island 969. 
  The Partnership s oil, gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) production volume and price information is summarized in the following table (gas volumes are presented in thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day): 

Oil and Gas Sales 
  Reflecting lower oil prices and production in   2016  , the Partnership s crude oil sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   totaled $  235,129   compared to $  335,088   of crude oil sales in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The Partnership s average realized price in the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $  9   per barrel from the   third   quarter of   2015  , reducing sales by $  59,097  . Crude oil volumes decreased to   61   barrels per day in the   third   quarter of   2016   as a result of natural depletion and four days of downtime at South Timbalier 295 for pipeline maintenance.  The downtime at South Timbalier 295 continued for 10 days after the quarter-end. 
  
   7 

Natural gas sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   totaled $  79,464   up   11   percent from the amount realized in 2015. The Partnership s average realized natural gas price for the quarter increased $  0.17   per Mcf, or   6   percent, from the   third   quarter of 2015, increasing sales by $  4,164   from a year ago. Natural gas volumes increased   5   percent from the   third   quarter of   2015   as a result of recompletions at South Timbalier 295 in 2015 and Ship Shoal 258/259 in 2016. 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Partnership sold   6   barrels per day of natural gas liquids compared to   14   barrels per day in 2015. The decrease reflected lower processed volumes at South Timbalier 295 in   2016  . The Partnership s average NGL price for the current quarter was up from a year ago. 
  Crude oil sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   totaled $0.8 million, down   30   percent from the same period in   2015  .  The Partnership s average realized oil price for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased   31   percent from the first   nine   months of   2015  , dropping to $  38.74   per barrel in   2016  .  The Partnership s crude oil volumes were flat at   73   barrels per day during the first nine months of   2016   and 2015 as recompletions at South Timbalier 295 offset the impact of natural depletion and pipeline downtime. 
  Natural gas sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased   15   percent from a year ago, dropping to $  202,027   in the current period from $  236,594   during the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The Partnership s average realized gas prices decreased from $  2.88   per Mcf in the first   nine   months of   2015   to $  2.29   per Mcf in   2016  , reducing sales by $  48,461  . A   22   Mcf per day, or   7   percent increase in natural gas volumes during the first   nine   months of   2016   from the same period a year ago increased sales by $  13,894  .  The Partnership s increase in gas production in   2016   primarily reflected the recompletions at South Timbalier 295. 
  The Partnership sold   10   barrels per day of natural gas liquids in the first   nine   months of   2016  , down from   14   barrels per day in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease reflected lower processed volumes at South Timbalier 295 in   2016  .  NGL prices for the first   nine   months decreased   8   percent from a year ago, dropping to $  16.74   per barrel in   2016  . 
  Since the Partnership does not anticipate acquiring additional acreage or conducting exploratory drilling on leases in which it currently holds an interest, declines in oil and gas production can be expected in future periods as a result of natural depletion. Also, given the small number of producing wells owned by the Partnership and exposure to inclement weather and pipeline interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, the Partnership s production during the remainder of   2016   and beyond may be subject to more volatility than those companies with a larger or more diversified property portfolio. 
  Operating Expenses 
  The Partnership s recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) rate, expressed as a percentage of oil and gas sales, was approximately 37 percent for the   third   quarter of   2016   and 31 percent for the   third   quarter of   2015  . DD A, expressed as a percentage of oil and gas sales, for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   was 41 percent and 26 percent, respectively. The increase in the rate as a percentage of oil and gas sales in 2016 reflected the impact of declining oil and gas prices. The dollar amount of recurring DD A expense for the first nine months of 2016 increased from the comparable period a year ago as a result of the higher DD A rate. 
  Under the full cost method of accounting, the Partnership is required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD A, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent per annum. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. As a result of the ceiling limitation, the Partnership wrote-down the carrying value of its oil and gas properties by approximately $0.2 million during the   third   quarter of   2016   and $2.9 million during the first   nine   months of   2016  . The write-downs are reflected as additional DD A expense.  If commodity prices do not recover from current levels, the Partnership may be required to recognize a non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Partnership recognized $  20,058   in asset retirement obligation accretion for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to $  32,910   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  For the   nine   month periods, the Partnership recognized $  59,307   in asset retirement obligation accretion for   2016   compared to $  97,440   for   2015  .  The declines reflected the abandonment of Matagorda Island 681 and North Padre Island 969/976 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  
   8 

Lease operating expenses (LOE) for the   third   quarter of   2016   of $  131,127   decreased   32   percent from the   third   quarter of   2015   with the reduced cost resulting from permanently shutting-in North Padre Island 969/976 for abandonment. LOE for the first   nine   months of 2016 of $  447,391   decreased   27   percent from the comparable period in 2015 as a result of permanently shutting-in North Padre Island 969/976 for abandonment and temporarily shutting-in Ship Shoal 258/259 for third-party pipeline repairs during the first quarter of 2016. 
  Gathering and transportation costs for the delivery of oil and gas totaled $  3,353   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to $  33,744   in the comparable period in   2015  . The decline in transportation cost in 2016 was a result of a change in marketing arrangements on the South Timbalier 295. Gathering and transportation costs during the first   nine   months of   2016   totaled $  81,973   compared to $  102,151   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
   
  Capital Resources and Liquidity 
  The Partnership s primary capital resource is net cash provided by operating activities.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Partnership had $229,158 of cash outflows from operating activities as the Partnership funded liabilities for accrued asset retirement obligations and operating expenses. The Partnership had positive cash provided by operations totaling $218,670 in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had approximately $5.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from approximately $5.2 million at   December 31, 2015   as the Partnership paid accrued asset retirement obligations and operating expenses during the first nine months of 2016. The Partnership s goal is to maintain cash and cash equivalents at least sufficient to cover the undiscounted value of its future asset retirement obligation liability. The Partnership also plans to reserve funds for repairs which may disrupt the Partnership s production and for future recompletion operations. 
  The Partnership s future financial condition, results of operations, and cash from operating activities will largely depend upon prices received for its oil and natural gas production. A substantial portion of the Partnership s production is sold under market-sensitive contracts. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty, and a variety of factors beyond the Partnership s control. These factors include worldwide political and economic conditions, the foreign and domestic supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of consumer demand, weather, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. 
  The Partnership s oil and gas reserves and production will also significantly impact future results of operations and cash from operating activities. The Partnership s production is subject to fluctuations in response to remaining quantities of oil and gas reserves, weather, pipeline capacity, consumer demand, mechanical performance and workover, recompletion and drilling activities. Declines in oil and gas production can be expected in future years as a result of normal depletion and the non-participation in acquisition or exploration activities by the Partnership. Based on production estimates from independent engineers and current market conditions, the Partnership forecasts it will be able to meet its liquidity needs for routine operations in the foreseeable future. The Partnership will reduce capital expenditures and distributions to partners as cash from operating activities declines. 
  In the event that future short-term operating cash requirements are greater than the Partnership s financial resources, the Partnership may seek short-term, interest-bearing advances from the Managing Partner as needed. The Managing Partner, however, is not obligated to make loans to the Partnership. 
  On an ongoing basis, the Partnership reviews the possible sale of lower value properties prior to incurring associated dismantlement and abandonment costs. 
   
  Capital Commitments 
  The Partnership s primary needs for cash are for operating expenses, drilling and recompletion expenditures, future dismantlement and abandonment costs, distributions to Investing Partners, and the purchase of Units offered by Investing Partners under the right of presentment. To the extent there is discretion, the Partnership allocates available capital to investment in the Partnership s properties so as to maximize production and resultant cash flow. The Partnership had no outstanding debt or lease commitments at   September 30, 2016  . The Partnership did not have any contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  , other than the liability for dismantlement and abandonment costs of its oil and gas properties. The Partnership has recorded a separate liability for the present value of this asset retirement obligation as discussed in the notes to the financial statements included in the Partnership s latest annual report on Form 10-K. 
  
   9 

During the first   nine   months of   2016   the Partnership's cash outlays for capital expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties totaled $38,187 as it participated in a recompletion project at Ship Shoal 258/259 during the period. The Partnership s cash outlays for capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2015 totaled $17,552 as the Partnership participated in a recompletion project at South Timbalier 295 during the period. During the first nine months of 2016, the Partnership made cash outlays of $290,458 on accrued asset retirement obligations incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015. Based on information supplied by the operators of the properties, the Partnership anticipates capital expenditures of less than $0.1 million during the remainder of 2016 as no new drilling projects are currently planned for   2016  . Capital estimates may change based on realized prices, changes by the operator to the development plan, pipeline construction or modifications, or changes in government regulations. 
  Because of low oil and gas prices and the need to reserve cash for future asset retirement obligations, no distributions were made to Investing Partners during the first   nine   months of   2016  , and no distributions to Investing Partners are anticipated during the fourth quarter of 2016. The Partnership also made no distribution to Investing Partners during the first   nine   months of   2015   as a result of low product prices and the large amount of pending plugging costs for Matagorda Island 681 and North Padre Island 969/976. 
  The amount of future distributions will be dependent on actual and expected production levels, realized and anticipated oil and gas prices, expected drilling and recompletion expenditures, and prudent cash reserves for future dismantlement and abandonment costs that will be incurred after the Partnership s reserves are depleted. The Partnership s goal is to maintain cash and cash equivalents in the Partnership at least sufficient to cover the undiscounted value of its future asset retirement obligations. The Partnership will review available cash balances, any development or abandonment plans submitted by the operators of the Partnership s properties, and the factors noted above to determine whether there are sufficient funds to make a distribution to Investing Partners during the first half of 2017. 
  With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM has issued Notice to Lessees (NTL) No. 2016-N01 pertaining to the obligations of companies to provide supplemental assurances for performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, decommissioning, and site clearance obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies  oil and gas leases.  Under this NTL, the Partnership will likely be required to provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Partnership s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases.  The Partnership will likely satisfy such requirements through the provision of bonds or other forms of security.  Management does not believe the ultimate satisfaction of the NTL requirements will adversely affect the Partnership's overall liquidity. 
  As provided in the Amended Partnership Agreement, a first right of presentment valuation was computed during the first quarter of   2016  .  The per-unit value was determined to be $  6,057   based on the valuation date of   December 31, 2015  .  A second right of presentment valuation was computed during October 2016 and the per-unit value was determined to be $6,091 based on a valuation date of June 30, 2016. The Partnership did not repurchase any Investing Partner Units (Units) during the first nine months of   2016  , and is not expected to purchase any Units in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the Partnership s limited amount of cash available for discretionary purposes.  Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has no obligation to repurchase any Units presented to the extent it determines that it has insufficient funds for such purchases.

ITEM 3.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Commodity Risk 
  The Partnership s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its natural gas production. Prices received for the Partnership s crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs have historically been and continue to be very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and global supply and demand. The Partnership did not use derivative financial instruments or otherwise engage in hedging activities during the first   nine   months of   2016   or   2015  . 
  The information set forth under  Commodity Risk  in Item 7A of the Partnership s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , is incorporated by reference. Information about market risks for the current quarter is not materially different. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  John J. Christmann IV, the Managing Partner s Chief Executive Officer and President (in his capacity as principal executive officer), and Stephen J. Riney, the Managing Partner s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (in his capacity as principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation and as of the date of that evaluation, these officers concluded that the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, providing effective means to ensure that the information it is required to disclose under applicable laws and regulations is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the Commission s rules and forms and communicated to our management, including the Managing Partner s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
