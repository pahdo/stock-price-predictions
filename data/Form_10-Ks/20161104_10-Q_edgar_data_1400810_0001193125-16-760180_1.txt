  Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
   Basis of Presentation      The
accompanying unaudited, consolidated financial statements for HCI Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules for interim financial reporting. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, in the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring
adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016.  
 In preparing the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements, management was required to make certain judgments, assumptions, and
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the periods being reported upon. Certain of the estimates result from judgments that
can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates.    Material estimates that are particularly
susceptible to significant change in the near term are related to the Company s losses and loss adjustment expenses, which include amounts estimated for claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company uses various assumptions and
actuarial data it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates. In addition, accounting policies for reinsurance contracts with retrospective provisions, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, fair
value of financial instruments and other-than-temporary impairment involve significant judgments and estimates material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
   Business Acquisitions.   The Company accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method, which requires it to
measure and recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. In the event that the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, a bargain
purchase gain is recorded.   Acquisitions of income-producing properties are typically considered business acquisitions. As such, the
Company allocates the purchase price to land, land improvements, buildings, tenant improvements, intangibles such as the value of significant tenant (i.e. anchor tenant) relationships, in-place leases, and assumed liabilities, if any. Tangible
assets are presented as real estate investments on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Buildings subject to leases are valued as if vacant.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)   
   
  The value attributable to in-place leases reflects the costs we would have incurred to lease the property to
the occupancy level that existed at the acquisition date. These costs include leasing commissions, tenant improvement allowances, and other direct costs required to lease the property. In addition, the estimated fair value of in-place
leases reflects the value of base rental revenues that would have been earned during the assumed periods of vacancy and the related carrying costs that would have been incurred to lease the vacant property to its existing occupancy. The Company
also reviews terms of the assumed leases to evaluate whether the terms are favorable or unfavorable relative to the market at the acquisition date. In the event the assumed leases are not at market terms, the Company recognizes an intangible
asset for a lease with favorable terms and a liability if the terms of the lease are unfavorable.   Transaction costs related to a business
acquisition are expensed as incurred. The Company includes acquisition-related costs associated with real estate investments in other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income. 
   Intangible Assets.   Intangibles consist of the value attributable to the acquired in-place leases and the primary, or
anchor, tenant relationships. The value attributable to the anchor tenant relationship represents the economic benefits of having a nationally recognized retailer as the lead tenant, which draws traffic and other tenants to the retail
center. These intangibles are amortized to expense over the related lease term. Amortization of the intangibles related to real estate investments is reflected in net investment income in the consolidated statement of income. The
Company reviews these intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
   Reclassifications.   Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year
presentation.    Note 2   Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15.   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230), which clarifies or provides specific guidance on how certain cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified. Some of the guidelines that may have potential impact on the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows are cash payments for debt prepayment, distributions received from equity method
investments, and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows.      Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-13.   In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 ( ASU 2016-13 ), Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires the measurement of credit losses for financial
assets at each reporting date based on reasonable and supportable information. ASU 2016-13 also requires enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures on significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses. ASU 2016-13
is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.

amendments in this update will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.  
   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10.   In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 ( ASU
2016-10 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the standard on identifying performance obligations and improves the licensing implementation guidance. ASU

classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. In addition, ASU 2016-09 allows for an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest
(current U.S. GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this
guidance on the Company s financial statements.      Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02.   In February 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840 and creates the new lease accounting standards for lessees and lessors, primarily related to the recognition of lease
assets and liabilities by lessees for leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.      Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01.   In

instruments. One of the changes is to require certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of
2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.

   Note 3   Investments   
   Available-for-Sale Securities      The
Company holds investments in fixed-maturity securities and equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated
fair value of the Company s available-for-sale securities by security type were as follows:     
   In June 2016, the Company s Alabama subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Assurance Company, Inc., voluntarily
surrendered its certificate of authority to the Alabama Department of Insurance and formally terminated its plan to conduct business in the state of Alabama. As a result, a statutory deposit held in trust for the Treasurer of Alabama was
released to the Company in July 2016. At December 31, 2015, there was $113 of U.S. Treasury securities held as a statutory deposit.  
 Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without
penalties. The scheduled contractual maturities of fixed-maturity securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Sales of Available-for-Sale Securities    
 Proceeds received, and the gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
     Other-than-temporary Impairment    
 The Company regularly reviews its individual investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company considers various
factors in determining whether each individual security is other-than-temporarily impaired, including-      

the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings;    
      12

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)   

the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been below its cost or amortized cost;        

general market conditions, industry or sector specific factors and other qualitative factors;        

nonpayment by the issuer of its contractually obligated interest and principal payments; and        

the Company s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of costs.    
 At September 30, 2016, one fixed-maturity security the Company intends to hold to maturity had a credit related loss. This compares with
two fixed-maturity securities at December 31, 2015 that were other-than-temporarily impaired. In June 2016, the Company sold one other-than-temporarily impaired fixed-maturity security due to uncertainties surrounding the issuer s
restructuring plan. Prior to the sale, this security s remaining $202 of impairment loss was reclassified from comprehensive income and recognized in total other-than-temporary impairment losses in the Company s consolidated statement
of income. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $531 of impairment loss on one fixed-maturity security, of which $180 was considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to a credit related loss and recorded in the
consolidated statement of income, with the remaining amount of $351 related to non-credit factors and recorded in other comprehensive income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $675 of impairment losses in the
consolidated statement of income, representing $206 of additional losses recorded during the period and the reclassification of $469 previously recorded in other comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the
Company recorded $705 of impairment losses on two fixed-maturity securities, of which $109 was related to credit losses, with the remaining amount of $596 related to non-credit factors.  
 The following table presents a rollforward of the cumulative credit losses in other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income from
available for sale fixed-maturity securities:      
   In determining whether equity securities are other than temporarily impaired, the Company considers its intent
and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of cost, the length of time each security has been in an unrealized loss position, the extent of the decline and the near term prospect for recovery. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had 16 and 17 equity securities, respectively, that were other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company recognized impairment losses of $44 and $1,777, respectively, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized impairment losses of $766 and $3,760, respectively.

   At December 31, 2015, there were 101 securities in an unrealized loss position. Of these securities, 10
securities had been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater. The gross unrealized loss of corporate bonds in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more included $581 of other-than-temporary impairment losses related
to non-credit factors.      Limited Partnership Investments    
 The Company has interests in limited partnerships that are not registered or readily tradeable on a securities exchange. These
partnerships are private equity funds managed by general partners who make all decisions with regard to financial policies and operations. As such, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate these partnerships. The

 The Company has an equity investment in one real estate development project, FMKT Mel JV, which is a limited liability company treated as a
joint venture under U.S. GAAP. In January 2016, FMKT Mel JV sold a portion of its outparcel land for gross proceeds of $829, of which $515 was used to repay a portion of the construction loan obtained for this project. FMKT Mel JV recognized a $404
gain on the outparcel sale of which $383 was allocated to the Company in accordance with the profit allocation specified in the operating agreement.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s maximum exposure to loss relating to the variable interest entity was $4,940
and $4,787, respectively, representing the carrying value of the investment. At September 30, 2016, there was an undistributed gain of $5 compared with an undistributed loss of $148 at December 31, 2015 from this equity method investment, the
amounts of which were included in the Company s consolidated retained income. FMKT Mel JV s partners received no cash distributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following tables provide FMKT Mel JV s
summarized unaudited financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its unaudited financial positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  Depreciation and amortization expense related to real estate investments was $126 and $87 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $314 and $280 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   ADC Arrangement    
 On August 16, 2016, the Company exercised the purchase option in its ADC Arrangement and acquired the retail shopping center and its
appurtenant facilities. The transaction was accounted for as a business acquisition. See Note 5    Business Acquisition  for additional information. In addition, the Company received $10,200 plus accrued investment
income of $74 in full settlement of the note receivable associated with the ADC Arrangement. At December 31, 2015, the Company s maximum exposure to loss relating to this variable interest was $10,200, representing the carrying value of
the ADC Arrangement. There was no credit loss allowance established as of December 31, 2015 as management believed the credit risk associated with the ADC Arrangement was mitigated by the collateral used to secure the loan.  
   Consolidated Variable Interest Entity    
 The Company has an ongoing real estate development project in Riverview, Florida through a joint venture in which the Company s subsidiary
has a controlling financial interest and, as a result, it is the primary beneficiary. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to this variable interest entity which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

   Note 4   Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
 Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income and other comprehensive income or loss, which for the Company includes changes in unrealized
gains or losses of investments carried at fair value and changes in the unrealized other-than-temporary impairment losses related to these investments. Reclassification adjustments for realized (gains) losses are reflected in net realized
investment gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of income. The components of other comprehensive income or loss and the related tax effects allocated to each component were as follows:  

Note 5   Business Acquisition   
 On August 16, 2016, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Greenleaf Capital, LLC, assigned the right to purchase the developed property
in the ADC Arrangement to its subsidiary, Sorrento PBX, LLC. Sorrento PBX simultaneously exercised the purchase option and acquired the property from Sorrento Retail Investments, LLC. The acquired assets included a retail shopping center
and appurtenant facilities in Sorrento, Florida as well as existing tenant lease agreements to use the property. The acquisition is part of the Company s strategic plan to expand its real estate operations. The purchase price was
$12,250, which was determined using a predetermined capitalization rate and the projected net operating income of the property. The Company recognized

a $2,071 gain on bargain purchase, resulting primarily from a favorable fair value at the date of acquisition as compared with the Company s purchase price. The Company relied on an
independent appraisal report, which is based on the weighted results of two valuation approaches, in determining the estimated fair values of the significant assets acquired. This acquisition was financed in part by the proceeds from the
issuance of a 3.75% promissory note. See Note 9    Long-Term Debt  for additional information.

  The table below presents an allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired based
on their fair values at the acquisition date:      
   The acquired business contributed $99 of rental income and $112 of net loss to the Company for the period from
August 16, 2016 to September 30, 2016. Pro forma results of operations are not presented as the effects of the acquisition were not material to the Company s consolidated results of operations.  
  Note 6   Fair Value Measurements   
 The Company records and discloses certain financial assets at their estimated fair value. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:       

Level 1 

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets;  

Level 2 

Other inputs that are observable for the asset and the liability, either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities that are not observable throughout the full term; and  

Level 3 

Inputs that are unobservable.  
 
    Valuation Methodology    
  Cash and cash equivalents   
 Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of money-market funds. Their carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity
and high liquidity of these funds.     Available-for-sale securities   
 Estimated fair values of the Company s available-for-sale securities are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, using valuation
techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Fair values are generally measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical securities or other inputs that are observable either
directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar securities. In those instances where observable inputs are  
      21

HCI GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   
  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)   

not available, fair values are measured using unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the security and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Fair value estimates derived from unobservable inputs are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates and the
estimated amounts and timing of future cash flows. The derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a current market
exchange.    The estimated fair values for securities that do not trade on a daily basis are determined by management, utilizing prices
obtained from an independent pricing service and information provided by brokers. Management reviews the assumptions and methods utilized by the pricing service and then compares the relevant data and pricing to broker-provided data. The
Company gains assurance of the overall reasonableness and consistent application of the assumptions and methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through ongoing monitoring of the reported fair values.  
  ADC Arrangement Classified as Real Estate Investment   
 As described in Note 3    Investments  under  ADC Arrangement , the ADC Arrangement represented a financing agreement with
a purchase option between Greenleaf Capital and a property developer. Based on the characteristics of this ADC Arrangement which were similar to those of an investment, combined with the expected residual profit being greater than 50%, the
arrangement was included in real estate investments at its carrying value in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Projected future cash inflows at maturity were discounted using a prevailing borrowing rate to estimate its
fair value that relies on Level 3 inputs. This ADC Arrangement was terminated at the time the Company exercised the purchase option to acquire the related property in August 2016.  
  Limited Partnership Investments   
 As described in Note 3    Investments  under  Limited Partnership Investments , the Company has interests in limited
partnerships which are private equity funds. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, these funds are required to use fair value accounting; therefore, the estimated fair value approximates the carrying value of these funds.  
  Long-term debt     Long-term
debt includes the Company s 8% senior notes due 2020, 3.875% convertible senior notes due 2019 and two promissory notes due through 2036. The 8% senior notes trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The estimated fair value of the 8%
senior notes is based on the closing market price at each balance sheet date. The 3.875% convertible senior notes were sold in a private offering. The fair values of the 3.875% convertible senior notes and the promissory notes are
estimated using a discounted cash flow method that relies on Level 3 inputs.

 Includes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.      As of September 30, 2016, the
remaining amortization period of the debt discount was 2.5 years.      3.75% Promissory Note    
 In connection with the business acquisition described in Note 5   Business Acquisition, Sorrento PBX, LLC entered into a 20-year secured
loan agreement for gross proceeds of $9,000. The loan proceeds were used to finance the acquisition. The loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of 3.75% and is collateralized by the acquired property and the assignment of associated lease
agreements. Approximately $53 of principal and interest is payable in 240 monthly installments beginning October 1, 2016. The promissory note may be repaid in full after September 1, 2017 as long as the Company provides at least 60
days  written notice and pays a prepayment premium as specified in the loan agreement. In addition, the lender may require full payment of the outstanding principal and unpaid interest on September 1, 2031 provided a written notice of its
intention to call the note is given at least six months in advance.      4% Promissory Note    
 On January 14, 2016, HCPCI Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a 15-year secured loan agreement for proceeds of
$9,200. The loan is collateralized by the Company s Tampa, Florida real estate, which is owned by HCPCI Holdings, and the lease agreements associated with this property. The loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of
4%. Approximately $68 of principal and interest is payable in 180 monthly installments beginning March 1, 2016. The promissory note may be repaid in full after February 1, 2017 as long as the Company provides at least 60 days  written
notice and pays a prepayment premium as specified in the loan agreement. The proceeds were used for real estate development projects or other general business purposes.  
   3.875% Convertible Senior Notes    
  Conversion Rate     Since
January 2015, the Company s cash dividends on common stock have exceeded $0.275 per share, resulting in adjustments to the conversion rate. As of September 30, 2016, each $1 of the Company s convertible notes would have been
convertible into 16.0833 shares of common stock, which was the equivalent of approximately $62.18 per share.

   Repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes   
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $13,010 in principal of its 3.875% convertible senior notes in
privately negotiated transactions for cash in the amount of $11,347, inclusive of $81 in commissions. As a result, the Company recognized a $153 gain on extinguishment net of $1,591 in unamortized debt discount and issuance costs and
commissions associated with the notes that were repurchased during the first quarter of 2016.     Note 10   Reinsurance   
 The Company cedes a portion of its homeowners  insurance exposure to other entities under catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties
and one quota share agreement. The Company remains liable for claims payments in the event that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreements. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in
losses to the Company. The Company enters into reinsurance treaties with highly rated and reputable reinsurers and it evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic
regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. The Company contracts with a number of reinsurers to secure its annual reinsurance coverage, which
generally becomes effective June 1st each year. The Company purchases reinsurance each year taking into consideration probable maximum losses and reinsurance market conditions.  
 The impact of the reinsurance treaties on premiums written and earned is as follows:  
   
   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no recoveries pertaining to
reinsurance contracts that were deducted from losses incurred. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 35 and 21 reinsurers, respectively, participating in the Company s reinsurance program. There were no amounts
receivable with respect to reinsurers at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Thus, there were no concentrations of credit risk associated with reinsurance receivables as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition, based
on the insurance ratings and the financial strength of the reinsurers, management believes there was no credit risk associated with its reinsurers  obligations to perform on any prepaid reinsurance contract as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.

  Certain of the reinsurance contracts include retrospective provisions that adjust premiums or
increase the amount of future coverage in the event losses are minimal or zero. Effective June 1, 2016, retrospective provisions include premium adjustments only. These adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as
net reductions in ceded premiums of $3,428 and $2,901 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $594 and $336 relates to the Company s contract with Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited (see Note 17   Related
Party Transactions). For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, these adjustments were $9,250 and $15,515, respectively, of which $1,334 and $2,461 relates to the Company s contract with Oxbridge. In June 2016, the Company
received a total of $37,800 in cash benefits related to two retrospective reinsurance contracts that terminated May 31, 2016 of which $7,560 was received from Oxbridge. In September 2016, the Company received the final cash payment of $5,716
under the terms of the remaining retrospective reinsurance contract which terminated May 31, 2016.    At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, other assets included $3,320 and $36,176, respectively, and prepaid reinsurance premiums included $1,214 and $2,625, respectively, which are related to these adjustments. Management believes the credit risk associated with the
collectability of these accrued benefits is minimal as the amount receivable is concentrated with one reinsurer and the Company monitors the creditworthiness of this reinsurer based on available information about the reinsurer s financial
position.     Note 11   Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses   
 The liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is determined on an individual case basis for all claims reported. The liability also
includes amounts for unallocated expenses, anticipated future claim development and losses incurred, but not reported.    Activity in the
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:

  The establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process and changes in loss
reserve estimates are expected as these estimates are subject to the outcome of future events. Changes in estimates, or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid, are reflected in the operating results of the period during which
such estimates are adjusted. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company experienced unfavorable development of $4,626 and $10,558, respectively, attributable to the settlement and further development of older claims
and an increase in late reported claims, primarily claims related to the 2015 loss year.    The Company writes insurance in the state of
Florida, which could be exposed to hurricanes or other natural catastrophes. The occurrence of a major catastrophe could have a significant effect on the Company s quarterly results and cause a temporary disruption of the normal operations
of the Company. However, the Company is unable to predict the frequency or severity of any such events that may occur in the near term or thereafter. 
  Note 12   Income Taxes     During the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded approximately $8,696 and $4,567, respectively, of income taxes, which resulted in effective tax rates of 43.4% and 38.3%, respectively. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $16,542 and $33,796, respectively, of income taxes, which resulted in estimated annual effective tax rates of 40.4% and 38.2%, respectively. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily
attributable to permanent differences between financial and tax income. The Company s estimated annual effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate due to state and foreign income taxes as well as certain nondeductible
and tax-exempt items.     Note 13   Earnings Per Share   
 U.S. GAAP requires the Company to use the two-class method in computing basic earnings per share since holders of the Company s restricted
stock have the right to share in dividends, if declared, equally with common stockholders. These participating securities affect the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share during periods of net income.

   Note 14   Stockholders  Equity   
   Common Stock      In December 2015, the
Company s Board of Directors authorized a one-year plan to repurchase up to $20,000 of the Company s common shares before commissions and fees. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased and retired a
total of 198,055 shares at a weighted average price per share of $30.29 under this authorized repurchase plan. The total cost of shares repurchased, inclusive of fees and commissions, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,008,
or $30.33 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 574,851 shares at a weighted average price per share of $31.31. The total cost of shares repurchased, inclusive of fees
and commissions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18,023, or $31.35 per share.   In 2014, the Company s Board of
Directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $40,000 of the Company s common shares before commissions and fees. This one-year repurchase plan expired March 31, 2015; therefore, there were no shares repurchased during the three months
ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 37,869 shares at a weighted average price per share of $42.49. The total cost of shares repurchased, inclusive of
fees and commissions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $1,610, or $42.51 per share.   On October 13, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividends are payable on December 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on November 18, 2016.

  A summary of the stock option activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 is as follows (option amounts not in thousands):      
   There were no options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three
months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized aggregate tax benefits of $117 for 10,000 options exercised of which the aggregate intrinsic value was $320. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized aggregate
tax benefits of $1,309 for 90,000 options exercised of which the aggregate intrinsic value was $3,508.     Restricted Stock Awards    
 From time to time, the Company has granted and may grant restricted stock awards to its executive officers, other employees and nonemployee
directors in connection with their service to the Company. The terms of the Company s outstanding restricted stock grants may include service, performance and market-based conditions. The fair value of the awards with market-based
conditions is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation method, which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and then establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome. The determination of fair value with respect to the awards
concerning only performance or service-based conditions is based on the market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date.

   Obligations under Multi-Year Reinsurance Contracts    
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has contractual obligations related to multi-year reinsurance contracts. These contracts were
effective June 1, 2016 and may be cancelled only with the other party s consent. The future minimum aggregate premiums payable to these reinsurers is $19,400 due in each of the twelve-month periods following September 30, 2016 and 2017.
     Capital Commitment    
 As described in Note 3    Investments  under  Limited Partnership Investments , the Company is contractually committed to
capital contributions under three limited partnership agreements. At September 30, 2016, there was an aggregate unfunded balance of $13,554. 
   Premium Tax      In
September 2013, the Company received a notice of intent to make audit adjustments from the Florida Department of Revenue ( the Department ) in connection with the Department s audit of the Company s premium tax returns for the
three-year period ended December 31, 2012. The auditor s proposed adjustments primarily related to the Department s proposed disallowance of the entire amount of $1,754 in Florida salary credits applicable to that period. The
proposed adjustment, which included interest through September 10, 2013, approximated $1,913. To resolve the matter, the Company entered into negotiations with the Department and reached an agreement in principle whereby certain of the
Company s subsidiaries would individually file and pay state reemployment taxes plus interest covering the periods under audit through the second quarter of 2014. Such filings were expected to yield a refund of reemployment taxes paid by
the Company. In December 2015, the Department issued its Notice of Decision indicating the Company owed approximately $38 in full settlement of the premium tax and related interest, which the Company paid in February 2016. The Company received
refunds totaling $57 related to its reemployment tax filings specific to the period for which the Company was required to file and pay the subsidiary reemployment tax returns as part of the negotiated settlement. As a result, the Company
realized a net benefit of $19. Management believes this matter is fully resolved.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)   
   
   Note 17   Related Party Transactions   
 Claddaugh Casualty Insurance Company, Ltd., the Company s Bermuda domiciled reinsurance subsidiary has a reinsurance agreement with
Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited whereby a portion of the business assumed from the Company s insurance subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Property   Casualty Insurance Company, Inc., is ceded by Claddaugh to Oxbridge. With respect to the
period from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016, Oxbridge assumed $11,600 of the total covered exposure for $3,340 in premiums. With respect to the period from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017, Oxbridge assumed $6,000 of the total covered
exposure for approximately $3,400 in premiums. See Note 10   Reinsurance   which includes the amounts due from and paid by Oxbridge during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 with respect to benefits accrued in
connection with the Oxbridge agreements. The premiums charged by Oxbridge are at rates which management believes to be competitive with market rates available to Claddaugh. Oxbridge has deposited funds into a trust account to satisfy certain
collateral requirements under its reinsurance contract with Claddaugh. Trust assets may be withdrawn by Claddaugh, the trust beneficiary, in the event amounts are due under the Oxbridge reinsurance agreements. Among the Oxbridge
shareholders are Paresh Patel, the Company s chief executive officer, who is also chairman of the board of directors for Oxbridge, and members of his immediate family and three of the Company s non-employee directors including Sanjay Madhu
who serves as Oxbridge s president and chief executive officer.     Note 18   Subsequent Event   
 During October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused significant property damage along an extensive area of Florida s east coast. As of
October 27, 2016, the Company had received approximately 2,000 claims and incurred initial losses totaling approximately $13,000, pre-tax, related to Hurricane Matthew. While it is too early to determine the ultimate net loss from this event,
the Company expects gross losses to be between $20,000 and $25,000, which falls below the Company s reinsurance retention level. As such, the Company does not anticipate reinsurance recoveries from its third-party reinsurers.

  OVERVIEW       General       
 HCI Group, Inc. is a Florida-based company owning subsidiaries engaged in property and casualty insurance, information technology, real estate
and reinsurance. Based on our organizational structure, revenue sources, and evaluation of financial and operating performances by management, we manage four operating segments under one reporting segment, which includes the following
operations:      

a) 
 Insurance Operations         Property and casualty insurance   
    Reinsurance       

b) 
 Other Operations         Real estate   
    Information technology   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from property and casualty insurance operations represented 88.0% and 90.0%,
respectively, of total revenues of all operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from property and casualty insurance operations represented 89.2% and 94.4%, respectively, of total revenues of all
operations. There was no other operating segment representing ten percent or more of total operating revenues. As a result, our four operating segments have been aggregated under one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes.

     Insurance Operations     
   Property and Casualty Insurance       Homeowners
Choice Property   Casualty Insurance Company, Inc.     Our principal operating subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Property   Casualty
Insurance Company, Inc. ( HCPCI ), is a leading provider of property and casualty insurance in the state of Florida. HCPCI along with certain of our other subsidiaries currently provides property and casualty insurance to homeowners,
condominium owners, and tenants in the state of Florida. Since 2014, HCPCI has offered flood-endorsed and wind-only policies to eligible new and pre-existing Florida customers. HCPCI strives to offer insurance products at competitive
rates, while pursuing profitability using selective underwriting criteria.   HCPCI began operations in 2007 by participating in a
 take-out program,  which is a legislatively mandated program designed to encourage private insurance companies to assume policies from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, a Florida state-supported insurer. Our growth since
inception has resulted primarily from a series of policy assumptions. This growth track has been beneficial to us although there are fewer policies available for assumption today as a result of increased competition in the Florida
market. Thus, we plan to seek other opportunities to expand by providing new or additional product offerings in and outside the state of Florida.  
  TypTap Insurance Company     TypTap
Insurance Company was organized by HCI Group, Inc. and approved by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in January 2016 to transact insurance business in the state of Florida. TypTap began writing standalone flood coverage to Florida
homeowners in March 2016.    We expect the flood insurance product offered both by TypTap and HCPCI to become a significant contributor to
future financial results.     Homeowners Choice Assurance Company, Inc.   
 In June 2016, our Alabama subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Assurance voluntarily surrendered its certificate of authority to the Alabama
Department of Insurance and, as a result, formally terminated its plan to conduct business in the state of Alabama. The withdrawal was effective on June 30, 2016.

    Reinsurance    
 We have a Bermuda domiciled wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, Claddaugh Casualty Insurance Company Ltd. We selectively retain risk in
Claddaugh, displacing the need for HCPCI to pay premiums to third party reinsurers. Claddaugh fully collateralizes its exposure to HCPCI by depositing funds into a trust account. Claddaugh also mitigates a portion of its risk through
retrocession contracts.       Other Operations     
   Real Estate      Our real estate
operations consist of multiple properties we own and operate. One of these properties was acquired by us during the third quarter of 2016. In addition, we own and manage two commercial development projects through joint ventures.  
  Investment Projects     We
had one real estate development and construction project in which our involvement was through an acquisition, development and construction loan arrangement ( ADC Arrangement ). Under the ADC Arrangement, Greenleaf Capital, one of our
wholly owned subsidiaries, had an option to purchase the property when the construction project was completed contingent upon tenant rental commitments for at least 90% of rentable space being secured by the developer. On August 16, 2016, we
exercised the purchase option and acquired the property for a purchase price of $12,250,000, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain as of the acquisition date of approximately $2,071,000. See Note 5    Business Acquisition  to
our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.    We also
have two real estate development projects through joint venture arrangements, one in which we have a 90% non-controlling equity interest and another which we consolidate with our operations. We believe these opportunities will enable us to grow
our real estate portfolio and diversify our future sources of income. See Note 3    Investments  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
     Information Technology      Our
information technology operations include a team of experienced software developers with extensive knowledge in developing web-based products and applications for mobile devices. The operations, which are in Noida, India and in Tampa, Florida,
are focused on developing cloud-based, innovative products or services that can be marketed to the public in addition to providing affiliates with back-office technology support services designed to facilitate and improve our ongoing
operations. Some of the technologies originally developed in-house for our own insurance operations have been launched for use by third parties. These products include the following:

    Recent Events       On August
31, 2016, the Company s subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Property   Casualty Insurance Company, Inc, was approved by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation to assume approximately 27,000 policies from Citizens Property Insurance
Corporation, Florida s state-operated insurance company. The Company expects to send out approximately 17,000 assumption letters on selected policies.  
 During October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused significant property damage along an extensive area of Florida s east coast. As of
October 27, 2016, we had received approximately 2,000 claims and incurred initial losses totaling approximately $13,000,000, pre-tax, related to Hurricane Matthew. While it is too early to determine the ultimate net loss from this event, we
expect gross losses to be between $20,000,000 and $25,000,000, which falls below our reinsurance retention level. As such, we do not anticipate reinsurance recoveries from our third-party reinsurers.  
 On October 13, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividends are payable on
December 16, 2016 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2016.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in
thousands, except per share amounts):

    Comparison of the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 with the Three Months ended September 30, 2015
     Our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflect income available to common stockholders of
approximately $11,333,000, or $1.10 earnings per diluted share, compared with approximately $7,371,000, or $0.71 earnings per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to a
reduction of $11,835,000 in premiums ceded, which offset an $11,300,000 decline in gross premiums earned. We also realized a $3,304,000 increase in net investment income and recognized a $2,071,000 gain on bargain purchase related to our August
2016 business acquisition. In addition, due primarily to the $8,091,000 increase in pre-tax income, our income tax expense increased $4,129,000 quarter over quarter.  
   Revenue       Gross Premiums
Earned  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $92,542,000 and $103,842,000, respectively. The decrease in 2016 was attributable to policy attrition as well as a rate decrease effective on new and renewal
policies beginning in January 2016.     Premiums Ceded  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately
$29,242,000 and $41,077,000, respectively, representing 31.6% and 39.6%, respectively, of gross premiums earned. The $11,835,000 decrease was primarily attributable to the lower costs of our 2016/17 reinsurance program as compared with the
costs of the 2015/16 program. In addition, the reduction to our ceded premiums attributable to retrospective provisions under certain reinsurance contracts was lower as compared with the corresponding period in 2015.  
 Our reinsurance program for 2016/17 provides coverage, which according to catastrophe models approved by the FLOIR, is sufficient to cover the
probable maximum loss resulting from a 1 in 165 year event. Our reinsurance program for 2015/16 provided coverage for a probable maximum loss resulting from a 1 in 260 year event. As a result of our program and pricing changes, we expect
to reduce our reinsurance costs by approximately $48,000,000 for the 2016/17 program year as compared with the 2015/16 program year.    Our
premiums ceded represent amounts paid to reinsurers to cover losses from catastrophes that exceed the retention levels defined by our catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties and to assume a proportional share of losses defined in quota share
arrangements, one of which was cancelled effective May 31, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, premiums ceded reflect net reductions of approximately $3,428,000 and $2,901,000, respectively, related to the provisions
under certain reinsurance contracts. See  Economic Impact of Reinsurance Contracts with Retrospective Provisions  under  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.  The rates we pay for reinsurance are based primarily
on policy exposures reflected in gross premiums earned.    Net Premiums Written  during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 totaled approximately $64,022,000 and $64,294,000, respectively. Net premiums written represent the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance costs. We had approximately 145,000
policies in force at September 30, 2016 as compared with approximately 165,000 policies in force at September 30, 2015.

   Net Premiums Earned  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
approximately $63,300,000 and $62,765,000, respectively, and reflect the gross premiums earned less reinsurance costs as described above.  
 The following is a reconciliation of our total Net Premiums Written to Net Premiums Earned for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 (amounts in thousands):      
    Net Investment Income  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
$2,785,000. This compared with a net investment loss of $519,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to $1,119,000 of income from limited partnership investments as compared with the
$2,400,000 losses incurred during the corresponding period in 2015. See Note 3    Investments  under Net Investment Income to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
    Net Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $224,000 and
$1,886,000, respectively. During the third quarter of 2016, we recognized impairment losses specific to one fixed-maturity security and four equity securities. One fixed-maturity security was subject to credit related loss impairment
resulting from our analysis of the issuer s expected cash flows. Four equity securities were deemed impaired due to the length of time each security had been in an unrealized loss position and giving consideration to the near term prospect
of recovery. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we recognized impairment losses specific to two fixed-maturity securities and five equity securities.  
  Policy Fee Income  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $972,000 and $994,000,
respectively. The slight decrease from the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to fewer policies in force.  
  Gain on bargain purchase  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,071,000, resulting from the August 2016
acquisition of one real estate business. See Note 5    Business Acquisition  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
   Expenses      Our  Losses and Loss
Adjustment Expenses  amounted to approximately $25,909,000 and $26,200,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses and loss adjustment expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included
claims from Hurricane Hermine with incurred initial losses of approximately $2.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Our 2015 losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected a large volume of reported claims and losses from
significant weather events that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
      42  

Table of Contents  

   Policy Acquisition and Other Underwriting Expenses  for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $10,536,000 and $10,675,000, respectively, primarily reflect commissions and premium taxes related to the policies that have renewed.  
  Salaries and Wages  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $5,945,000 and $5,040,000,
respectively. The $905,000 increase from the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount as well as merit increases during 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016, we had 243 employees
located at our offices in Florida compared with 220 employees as of September 30, 2015. We also had 80 employees located in Noida, India at September 30, 2016 versus 85 at September 30, 2015.  
  Income Tax Expense  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $8,696,000 and $4,567,000, respectively,
for state, federal, and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective tax rate of 43.4% for 2016 and 38.3% for 2015. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily attributable to permanent differences between financial and tax income.
     Ratios:      The loss ratio
applicable to the three months ended September 30, 2016 (losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred related to net premiums earned) was 40.9% compared with 41.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to
a decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses combined with a slight increase in net premiums earned.    The expense ratio applicable to
the three months ended September 30, 2016 (defined as underwriting expenses, salaries and wages, interest and other operating expenses related to net premiums earned) was 37.7% compared with 36.9% for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in our expense ratio was primarily attributable to the increase in personnel costs.    The combined ratio (total of
all expenses in relation to net premiums earned) is the measure of overall underwriting profitability before other income. Our combined ratio for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 78.6%.  
 Due to the impact our reinsurance costs have on net premiums earned from period to period, our management believes the combined ratio measured
to gross premiums earned is more relevant in assessing overall performance. The combined ratio to gross premiums earned for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 53.8% compared with 47.5% for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in gross premiums earned.      Comparison of the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016
with the Nine Months ended September 30, 2015      Our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect
income available to common stockholders of approximately $24,413,000, or $2.41 earnings per diluted share, compared with approximately $54,771,000, or $4.84 earnings per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
period-over-period decline was primarily due to a $34,901,000 decrease in gross premiums earned as well as a $5,704,000 increase in premiums ceded, resulting in a decrease in net premiums earned of $40,605,000. In addition, our 2016 results
were affected by a $13,457,000 increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses. These factors contributed to a $47,612,000 decrease in pre-tax income and, as a result, our income tax expense decreased $17,254,000 period over period.

    Revenue    
  Gross Premiums Earned  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $286,273,000 and $321,174,000,
respectively. The decrease in 2016 was attributable to policy attrition as well as a rate decrease effective on new and renewal policies beginning in January 2016.  
  Premiums Ceded  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $105,998,000 and $100,294,000, respectively,
representing 37.0% and 31.2%, respectively, of gross premiums earned. We did not purchase reinsurance coverage for policies assumed in December 2014 until June 1, 2015 as these policies were assumed outside of hurricane season. As a
result, our reinsurance costs were lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared with the same period in 2016. In addition, the reduction to our ceded premiums attributable to retrospective provisions under certain reinsurance
contracts was lower in 2016 as compared with the corresponding period in 2015.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
premiums ceded reflected net reductions of approximately $9,250,000 and $15,515,000, respectively, related to the provisions under certain reinsurance contracts. See  Economic Impact of Reinsurance Contracts with Retrospective
Provisions  under  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.  The rates we pay for reinsurance are based primarily on policy exposures reflected in gross premiums earned. 
  Net Premiums Written  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $202,307,000 and $241,841,000,
respectively. The decrease in 2016 resulted from a decrease of approximately $33,830,000 in gross premiums written combined with an increase of approximately $5,704,000 in premiums ceded during the year.  
  Net Premiums Earned  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $180,275,000 and $220,880,000,
respectively, and reflected the gross premiums earned less reinsurance costs as described above.    The following is a reconciliation of our
total Net Premiums Written to Net Premiums Earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):      
    Net Investment Income  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately
$6,000,000 and $2,685,000. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to $54,000 of income from limited partnership investments as compared with the $2,862,000 losses incurred during the corresponding period in 2015.  
  Net Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $1,441,000 and
$3,869,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized impairment losses specific to two fixed-maturity securities and 16 equity securities. The fixed-maturity securities were subject to credit related
loss

impairment resulting from our analysis of their expected cash flows. Sixteen equity securities were impaired due to the length of time each security had been in an unrealized loss position
and giving consideration to the near term prospect of recovery. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized impairment losses specific to two fixed-maturity securities and eight equity securities, one of which accounted for
$1,598,000 of the total impairment losses.     Policy Fee Income  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $2,967,000 and $2,477,000, respectively. Beginning in March 2015, we have used actual policy cancellations in our calculation of policy fee income whereas estimated attrition rates were used in this calculation prior to March
2015. In addition, the unearned portion of nonrefundable policy fee income was fully recognized for policies that were cancelled during the 2016 period. As a result, our 2016 policy fee income was higher than in 2015 despite the decline in
gross premiums earned.     Gain on Repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $153,000. The gain was attributable to the repurchase of $13,010,000 in principal of our 3.875% Convertible Senior Notes during the first quarter of 2016. We did not repurchase any of our 3.875% Convertible Senior Notes
during 2015. See Note 9    Long-term Debt  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  Gain on bargain purchase  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,071,000, resulting from the August 2016
acquisition of one real estate business. See Note 5    Business Acquisition  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
   Expenses      Our  Losses and Loss
Adjustment Expenses  amounted to approximately $79,261,000 and $65,804,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our 2016 losses and loss adjustment expenses were impacted by weather-related events in both
years and Hurricane Hermine in 2016 as well as continued reserve strengthening due to trends involving assignment of benefits and related litigation. See  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  under  Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates.      Policy Acquisition and Other Underwriting Expenses  for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $32,525,000 and $30,917,000, respectively. The $1,608,000 increase from the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to commissions and premium taxes related to the policies assumed from
Citizens that have renewed and are included in 2016 premiums.     Salaries and Wages  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were approximately $17,009,000 and $15,174,000, respectively. The $1,835,000 increase from the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount as well as merit increases during the 2016 and
2015.     Other Operating Expenses  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $14,213,000 and
$14,040,000, respectively. The $173,000 increase was primarily attributable to a $1,148,000 increase in general administrative expenses reduced by a $975,000 decrease in stock-based compensation.

   Income Tax Expense  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $16,542,000
and $33,796,000, respectively, for state, federal, and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective tax rate of 40.4% for 2016 and 38.2% for 2015.  
   Ratios:      The loss ratio applicable
to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 44.0% compared with 29.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in net premiums earned and increased losses as described previously.  
 The expense ratio applicable to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 39.8% compared with 30.9% for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in our expense ratio is primarily attributable to the decrease in 2016 net premiums earned.   The combined ratio is
the measure of overall underwriting profitability before other income. Our combined ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 83.8% compared with 60.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Due to the impact our reinsurance costs have on net premiums earned from period to period, our management believes the combined ratio measured
to gross premiums earned is more relevant in assessing overall performance. The combined ratio to gross premiums earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 52.8% compared with 41.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
     Seasonality of Our Business    
 Our insurance business is seasonal as hurricanes and tropical storms typically occur during the period from June 1 through
November 30 each year. Although not as typical, we may also experience significant winter storm activity as we did during the first quarter of 2016. With our reinsurance treaty year effective June 1 each year, any variation in
the cost of our reinsurance, whether due to changes in reinsurance rates or changes in the total insured value of our policy base, will occur and be reflected in our financial results beginning June 1 each year.  
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 Throughout our history, our liquidity requirements have been met through issuances of our common and preferred stock, debt offerings and funds
from operations. We expect our future liquidity requirements will be met by funds from operations, primarily the cash received by insurance subsidiaries from premiums written and investment income. We may consider raising additional capital
through debt and equity offerings to support our growth and future investment opportunities.    Our insurance subsidiary requires liquidity
and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants and to fund operating expenses. In addition, we attempt to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and surplus to manage any differences between the duration of our
liabilities and invested assets. In the insurance industry, cash collected for premiums from policies written is invested, interest and dividends are earned thereon, and losses and loss adjustment expenses are paid out over a period of
years. This period of time varies by the circumstances surrounding each claim. Substantially all of our losses and loss adjustment expenses are fully settled and paid within 100 days of the claim receipt date. Additional cash outflow
occurs through payments of underwriting costs such as commissions, taxes, payroll, and general overhead expenses. 
      46  

Table of Contents  

  We believe that we maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and expenses, as well as to
satisfy commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reinsurer insolvencies, inadequate premium rates, or reserve deficiencies. We maintain a comprehensive reinsurance program at levels management considers adequate to diversify risk and
safeguard our financial position.    In the future, we anticipate our primary use of funds will be to pay claims, reinsurance premiums,
interest, and dividends and to fund operating expenses. In addition, we intend to continue investing in real estate to maximize returns and diversify our sources of income, pursue acquisition opportunities, or consider other strategic
opportunities.      Senior Notes and Promissory Note

of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information including information on repurchases of our convertible senior notes.      Limited
Partnership Investments      Our limited partnership investments consist of four private equity funds managed by their general
partners. Three of these funds have unexpired capital commitments which are callable at the discretion of the fund s general partner for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. At September 30, 2016, there was an aggregate
unfunded capital balance of $13,554,000. See  Limited Partnership Investments  under Note 3    Investments  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional
information.      Share Repurchase Plan    
 On December 15, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a one-year plan to repurchase up to $20,000,000 of common shares under which we may
purchase shares of common stock in open market purchases, block transactions and privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $2,000,000 available under
the plan which was completed November 1, 2016. See Note 14    Stockholders  Equity  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
   Real Estate Development in Progress    
 We currently have development projects through our joint ventures. Although we have no outstanding commitment to fund any of the existing
projects and we expect to finance existing and future development projects with cash from real estate operations and through property financings, we may be required to make additional capital contributions when warranted.

    Impact from Hurricane Matthew    
 Based on our preliminary estimate of the losses caused by Hurricane Matthew as described in Note 18    Subsequent Event  to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not believe there will be a significant impact on our future liquidity and financial position.  
   Sources and Uses of Cash       Cash Flows for the
Nine months ended September 30, 2016     Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $91,465,000, which consisted primarily of cash received from net premiums written less cash disbursed for operating expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest payments. Net cash used in investing activities of
$46,447,000 was primarily due to the purchases of available-for-sale securities of $92,491,000, and the limited partnership investments of $4,670,000, offset by the proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities of $51,570,000. Net cash
used in financing activities totaled $20,868,000, which was primarily due to $11,347,000 used in the repurchases of our convertible senior notes, $18,023,000 used in our share repurchase plan and $8,807,000 of net cash dividend payments, offset by
$18,200,000 in aggregate proceeds from the issuance of two promissory notes.     Cash Flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2015   
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $106,330,000, which consisted
primarily of cash received from net premiums written less cash disbursed for operating expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest payments. Net cash used in investing activities of $79,773,000 was primarily due to the purchases
of available-for-sale securities of $121,176,000, the funding of the ADC Arrangement of $6,276,000 and $22,486,000 used to fund the limited partnership investments, decreased by redemptions and repayments of fixed-maturity securities of $5,655,000,
and the proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities of $65,621,000. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $9,380,000, which was primarily due to $1,610,000 used in our share repurchase plan and $9,077,000 of net cash dividend
payments, offset by $1,836,000 of tax benefits on stock-based compensation.      Investments    
 The main objective of our investment policy is to maximize our after-tax investment income with a reasonable level of risk given the current
financial market. Our excess cash is invested primarily in money market accounts and available-for-sale investments.   At September 30,
2016, we had $221,476,000 of available-for-sale investments, which are carried at fair value. Changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed-maturity investments. While a rising interest rate
environment enhances the returns available on new investments, it reduces the market value of existing fixed-maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new
fixed-maturity investments but increases the market value of existing fixed-maturity investments, creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition.

  With the exception of large national banks, it is our current policy not to maintain cash
deposits of more than an aggregate of $10,000,000 in any one bank at any time. From time to time, we may have in excess of $10,000,000 of cash designated for investment and on deposit at a single national brokerage firm. In the future, we
may alter our investment policy as to investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, preferred and common equity securities and real estate mortgages, as permitted by applicable law, including insurance regulations.  
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS     As of
September 30, 2016, we had unexpired capital commitments for three of the four limited partnerships in which we hold interests. Such commitments are not recognized in the financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the notes to the
financial statements. See Note 16    Commitments and Contingencies  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and  Contractual Obligations and Commitment  below for

    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   
 We have prepared our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in our consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.
 
      49  

Table of Contents  

  We believe our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to losses and loss
adjustment expenses, reinsurance with retrospective provisions, deferred income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense. These policies are critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results. They require
management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are related to our losses and loss adjustment expense reserves, which
include amounts estimated for claims incurred but not yet reported and reinsurance contracts with retrospective provisions.       Reserves for Losses
and Loss Adjustment Expenses       Our liability for losses and loss adjustment expense ( Reserves ) are specific to
property insurance, which is our insurance division s only line of business. The Reserves include both case reserves on reported claims and our reserves for incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) losses. At each period end date,
the balance of our Reserves is based on our best estimate of the ultimate cost of each claim for those known cases and the IBNR loss reserves are estimated based primarily on our historical experience. Changes in the estimated liability are
charged or credited to operations when the losses and loss adjustment expenses are adjusted.    The IBNR represents our estimate of the
ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred but have not been reported to us, and in some cases may not yet be known to the insured, and future development of reported claims. Estimating the IBNR component of our Reserves involves
considerable judgment on the part of management. At September 30, 2016, $37,609,000 of the total $57,195,000 we have reserved for losses and loss adjustment expenses is attributable to our estimate of IBNR. The remaining $19,586,000
relates to known cases which have been reported but not yet fully settled in which case we have established a reserve based on currently available information and our best estimate of the cost to settle each claim. At September 30, 2016,
$12,249,000 of the $19,586,000 in reserves for known cases relates to claims incurred during prior years.    Our Reserves increased from
$51,690,000 at December 31, 2015 to $57,195,000 at September 30, 2016. The $5,505,000 increase in our Reserves is comprised of $30,029,000 in reserves related to claims occurring in the 2016 loss year offset by reductions in our Reserves of
$13,319,000 for 2015 and $11,205,000 for 2014 and prior loss years. The $30,029,000 in Reserves established for 2016 claims is primarily driven by an allowance for subsequent development of claims reported for the accident year and an allowance
for those claims that have been incurred but not reported to the company as of September 30, 2016. The decrease of $24,524,000 specific to our 2015 and prior loss-year reserves is primarily due to settlement of claims related to those loss
years.    Based on all information known to us, we consider our Reserves at September 30, 2016 to be adequate to cover our claims for losses
that have occurred as of that date including losses yet to be reported to us. However, these estimates are continually reviewed by management as they are subject to significant variability and may be impacted by trends in claim severity and
frequency or unusual exposures that have not yet been identified. As part of the process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated regulatory and legal developments, changes in social attitudes,
inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data becomes available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in increases or decreases to the existing unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses. Adjustments are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liabilities may deviate substantially from prior estimates.

     Economic Impact of Reinsurance Contracts with Retrospective Provisions     
 Certain of our reinsurance contracts include retrospective provisions that adjust premiums or increase the amount of future coverage in the
event losses are minimal or zero. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we will recognize an asset in the period in which the absence of loss experience gives rise to an increase in future
coverage or obligates the reinsurer to pay cash or other consideration under the contract. In the event that a loss arises, we will derecognize such asset in the period in which a loss arises. Such adjustments to the asset, which accrue
throughout the contract term, will negatively impact our operating results when a catastrophic loss event occurs during the contract term. Effective June 1, 2016, retrospective provisions include premium adjustments only.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we accrued benefits of $2,490,000 and $4,709,000, respectively. For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, we deferred recognition of $937,000 in ceded premiums. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized ceded premiums of $1,808,000, representing amortization of previously deferred reinsurance
costs for increased coverage. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net reductions in ceded premiums totaled $3,428,000 and $2,901,000, respectively.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we accrued benefits of $11,120,000 and $17,077,000, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized net ceded premiums of $1,871,000, representing amortization of $3,085,000 of previously deferred reinsurance costs for increased coverage offset by $1,214,000 of ceded premiums deferred for the
period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized net ceded premiums of $1,562,000, representing amortization of $1,825,000 of previously deferred reinsurance costs for increased coverage decreased by a net increase of
$263,000 of ceded premiums deferred for the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net reductions in ceded premiums totaled $9,250,000 and $15,515,000, respectively.  
 In June 2016, we received cash totaling $37,800,000 in connection with the benefits accrued for two retrospective reinsurance contracts that
were terminated effective May 31, 2016. In September 2016, we received the final cash payment of $5,716,000 under the terms of the remaining retrospective reinsurance contract which terminated May 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had
$3,320,000 of accrued benefits and $1,214,000 of ceded premiums deferred, amounts that would be charged to earnings in the event we experience a catastrophic loss that exceeds the coverage limits provided under such agreements and in the period that
the increased coverage is applicable. At December 31, 2015, we had $35,716,000 of accrued benefits and $3,085,000 of ceded premiums deferred related to these agreements.  
 We believe the credit risk associated with the collectability of these accrued benefits is minimal based on available information about the
individual reinsurer s financial position.    The above and other accounting estimates and their related risks that we consider to be
our critical accounting estimates are more fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes with respect to any of
our critical accounting policies.     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     ITEM 3      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK        Our investment portfolio at September 30, 2016 included fixed-maturity and equity securities, the purposes of which
are not for trading or speculation. Our main objective is to maximize after-tax investment income and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations while minimizing market risk, which is the potential economic loss from adverse
fluctuations in securities prices. We consider many factors including credit ratings, investment concentrations, regulatory requirements, anticipated fluctuation of interest rates, durations and market conditions in developing investment
strategies. Our investment securities are managed primarily by outside investment advisors and are overseen by the investment committee appointed by our board of directors.  
 Our investment portfolios are exposed to interest rate risk, credit risk and equity price risk. Fiscal and economic uncertainties caused
by any government action or inaction may exacerbate these risks and potentially have adverse impacts on the value of our investment portfolios.  
 We classify our fixed-maturity and equity securities as available-for-sale and report any unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred income
taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income within our stockholders  equity. As such, any material temporary changes in their fair value can adversely impact the carrying value of our stockholders  equity.  
  Interest Rate Risk     Our fixed-maturity
securities are sensitive to potential losses resulting from unfavorable changes in interest rates. We manage the risk by analyzing anticipated movement in interest rates and considering our future capital needs.  
 The following table illustrates the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates to the fair value of our fixed-maturity securities at
September 30, 2016 (amounts in thousands):      
    Credit Risk   
 Credit risk can expose us to potential losses arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our
fixed-maturity securities. We mitigate the risk by investing in fixed-maturity securities that are generally investment grade, by diversifying our investment portfolio to avoid concentrations in any single issuer or business sector, and by
continually monitoring each individual security for declines in credit quality. While we emphasize credit quality in our investment selection process, significant downturns in the markets or general economy may impact the credit quality of our
portfolio.

    Equity Price Risk   
 Our equity investment portfolio at September 30, 2016 included common stocks, perpetual preferred stocks, mutual funds and exchange traded
funds. We may incur potential losses due to declines in equity security prices. We manage the risk primarily through industry and issuer diversification and asset mix.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial
officer (our principal financial officer), we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and, based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting    There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Limitations on Effectiveness
of Controls and Procedures     In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, implementation of possible controls and procedures depends on management s judgment in
evaluating their benefits relative to costs.

     PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    ITEM 1      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS      
 As previously reported in our Form 10-K which was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016, the Company, each of the directors and two shareholders
agreed to a settlement with respect to demands by the two shareholders. As a result, certain of the directors  restricted shares were cancelled March 2, 2016. The cancelled shares were made up of 148,000 shares that would vest in the
event our share price reached $50.00 and 12,000 shares that would vest in the event our share price reached $95.00. Our board members and the Company have also implemented certain non-financial corporate governance changes. We are not
aware of any other pending shareholder demands.    The Company is a party to claims and legal actions arising routinely in the ordinary
course of our business. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of the claims and lawsuits asserted against us, we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       ITEM 1A  
   RISK FACTORS        With the exception of the items described below, there have been no material changes from the risk
factors previously disclosed in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016.      Our
revenue from real estate investments may be affected by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants. Our reliance on a single or significant tenant at certain properties may impact our ability to lease vacated space and adversely
affect returns on the specific property.      At certain retail centers, we may have tenants, commonly referred to as anchor tenants,
occupying all or a large portion of the gross leasable space. In the event an anchor tenant becomes insolvent, suffers a downturn in business, ceases its operations at the retail center, or otherwise determines not to renew its lease, any
reduction or cessation of rental payments to us could adversely affect the returns on our real estate investments. A lease termination or cessation of operations by an anchor tenant could also lead to the loss of other tenants at the specific
retail location. We may then incur additional expenses to make improvements and prepare the vacated space to be leased to one or more new tenants.  
 Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer. The transfer to a new
anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center. A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to
terminate their leases.

and Other Limitations on Payment of Dividends     We are not subject to working capital restrictions or other limitations on the payment
of dividends. Our insurance subsidiary, however, is subject to restrictions on the dividends it may pay. Those restrictions could impact HCI s ability to pay future dividends.      
 Under Florida law, a domestic insurer such as our insurance subsidiary, HCPCI, may not pay any dividend or distribute cash or other property
to its stockholder except out of that part of its available and accumulated capital and surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains. Additionally, Florida statutes preclude
our insurance subsidiary from making dividend payments or distributions to its stockholder, HCI, without prior approval of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation if the dividend or distribution would exceed the larger of (1) the lesser
of (a) 10.0% of its capital surplus or (b) net income, not including realized capital gains, plus a two year carry forward, (2) 10.0% of capital surplus with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25% of unrealized capital
gains or (3) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of capital surplus or (b) net investment income plus a three year carry forward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25% of unrealized capital gains.  
      56

  Alternatively, a Florida domestic insurer may pay a dividend or distribution without the prior
written approval of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (1) if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the insurer s capital surplus as regards policyholders derived from realized net operating profits on its
business and net realized capital gains or (b) the insurer s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year, (2) the insurer will have policy holder capital surplus equal to or
exceeding 115.0% of the minimum required statutory capital surplus after the dividend or distribution, (3) the insurer files a notice of the dividend or distribution with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation at least ten business days prior to
the dividend payment or distribution and (4) the notice includes a certification by an officer of the insurer attesting that, after the payment of the dividend or distribution, the insurer will have at least 115% of required statutory capital
surplus as to policyholders. Except as provided above, a Florida domiciled insurer may only pay a dividend or make a distribution (1) subject to prior approval by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation or (2) 30 days after the Florida
Office of Insurance Regulation has received notice of such dividend or distribution and has not disapproved it within such time.    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, HCPCI paid a $19,000,000 dividend to HCI.       ITEM 3      DEFAULTS UPON
