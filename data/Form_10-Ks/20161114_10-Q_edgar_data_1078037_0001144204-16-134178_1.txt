  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 (Unaudited) 

1.      DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The Company is a manufacturer
and distributor of cosmetic dentistry products, including a full line of professional dental tooth whitening products which are
distributed in Europe, Asia and the United States. The Company manufactures many of its products in Ghent, Belgium as well as outsourced
manufacturing in its facility in Beijing, China.  The Company distributes its products using both its own internal sales force
and through the use of third party distributors. 

In these notes, the terms  Remedent ,
 Company ,  we ,  us  or  our  mean Remedent, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries,
whose operations are included in these consolidated financial statements. 

The Company s financial
statements have been prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary
for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented have been reflected herein. 

These financial statements of
the Company are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Despite the net profit
for the accounting years ending March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, the accumulated losses of the past affect the financial situation
of the Company. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to continue to
generate profitable operations. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had a working capital deficit of $625,663, and an accumulated
deficit of $20,683,194. Additional funding may be required in order to support the Company s operations and the execution
of its business plan. 

There can be no assurance that
the Company will be successful in raising the required capital or that it will ultimately attain a successful level of operations.
These risks, among others, are also discussed in ITEM 1A   Risk Factors in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K
filed on June 29, 2016 with the SEC. 

The Company has conducted a
subsequent events review through the date the financial statements were issued, and has concluded that there were no subsequent
events requiring adjustments or additional disclosures to the Company's financial statements at September 30, 2016. 

2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The accounting policies of the
Company, as applied in the interim consolidated financial statements presented herein are substantially the same as presented in
the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, except as may be indicated below: 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of: Remedent N.V. (incorporated in Belgium) located in Ghent, Belgium, Remedent Professional,
Inc. and Remedent Professional Holdings, Inc. (both incorporated in California and inactive), Glamtech-USA, Inc. (a Delaware corporation
acquired effective August 24, 2008), Remedent N.V. s 50 % owned subsidiary, Biotech Dental Benelux N.V., a Belgium private
company located in Ghent, Remedent N.V. s 51% owned subsidiary, GlamSmile Deutschland GmbH, a German private company located
in Munich (effective March 31, 2014 this subsidiary is inactive) and Remedent N.V. s 80 % owned subsidiary, GlamSmile Rome,
an Italian private company located in Rome (effective March 31, 2014 this subsidiary is inactive). 

Remedent N.V. owns 21.51 % of
Glamsmile Dental Technology Ltd., a Cayman Islands company ( Glamsmile Dental ). The subsidiaries of Glamsmile Dental
include: Glamsmile (Asia) Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong, Beijing Glamsmile Technology Development
Ltd., a 100% owned subsidiary or GlamSmile Asia, its 80% owned subsidiary Beijing Glamsmile Trading Co., Ltd. and its 98% owned
subsidiary Beijing Glamsmile Dental Clinic Co., Ltd., including its 100% owned Shanghai Glamsmile Dental Clinic Co., Ltd., its
100% owned Guangzhou Dental Clinic Co., Ltd. and its 50% owned Whenzhou GlamSmile Dental Clinic Ltd., which are accounted for using
the equity method after January 31, 2012 (see Note 3   Long-term Investment) 

Remedent, Inc. is a holding
company with headquarters in Ghent, Belgium. Remedent Professional, Inc. and Remedent Professional Holdings, Inc. have been dormant
since inception. 

For all periods presented, all
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements and corporate
administrative costs are not allocated to subsidiaries. 

Interim Financial
Information 

The interim consolidated financial
statements of Remedent, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company ) are condensed and do not include some of the information
necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the financial data. Management believes that all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of results have been included in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented.
Operating results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ended March 31, 2016. Accordingly, your attention is directed to footnote disclosures found in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending March 31, 2016, and particularly to Note 2, which includes a summary of significant
accounting policies. 

Warranties 

The Company typically warrants
its products against defects in material and workmanship for a period of 24 months from shipment. 

A tabular reconciliation of
the Company s aggregate product warranty liability for the reporting periods is as follows: 

Based upon historical trends
and warranties provided by the Company s suppliers and sub-contractors, the Company has made a provision for warranty costs
of $5,615 and $5,695 as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. 

Computation of Earnings (Loss)
per Share 

Basic net income (loss) per
common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) per common share attributable to common stockholders assuming
dilution is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued. 

On April 1, 2009, the Company
adopted changes issued by the FASB to the calculation of earnings per share. These changes state that unvested share-based payment
awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities
and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method for all periods presented. The
adoption of this change had no impact on the Company s basic or diluted net loss per share because the Company has never
issued any share-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights. 

At each of September
30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had 19,995,969, shares of common stock issued and
outstanding.  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company did not have any warrants outstanding but
had 1,507,500 and 1,507,500 options outstanding respectively.   

Further, pursuant to ASC 260-10-50-1(c),
if a fully diluted share calculation was computed for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015 respectively, it would have excluded all options respectively since the Company s average share trading price during
the three month and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were less than the exercise price of all
options. 

Conversion of Foreign Currencies 

The reporting and functional
currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The home currency for the Company s
European subsidiaries, Remedent N.V., Biotech Dental Benelux N.V.,GlamSmile Rome and GlamSmile Deutschland GmbH, is the Euro, for
Glamsmile Asia Ltd., and its subsidiaries, the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese Renmimbi ( RMB ) for Mainland China.
The assets and liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other that the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidation
by translating the assets and liabilities at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. The statements of
income of such companies are translated at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. Translation gains or losses
are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders  equity. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

The Company s only component
of other comprehensive income is the accumulated foreign currency translation consisting of (loss) and gains of $(19,801) and $
16,673 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts have been recorded as a separate component
of stockholders  equity (deficit). 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Not Yet Adopted   

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March
2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively. 

This ASU supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements in   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) ,  and requires entities to recognize revenue in
a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of
this pronouncement by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. Early
adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date, which for annual periods was December 15, 2016. We are
evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. 

3 .   LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS  

GLAMSMILE ASIA LTD.  

Acquisition  

Effective January 1, 2010 the
Company acquired 50.98% of the issued and outstanding shares of Glamsmile Asia Ltd. ( Glamsmile Asia  or  Glamsmile ),
a private Hong Kong company, with subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Mainland China, in exchange for the following consideration: 

All options
reside under the Company s option plan and are five year options. 

Also pursuant to the agreement, the Company
granted irrevocable right to Glamsmile Asia to use the Glamsmile trademark in Greater China. 

The Company acquired a 50.98% interest
in GlamSmile Asia Ltd. ( GlamSmile Asia ) in order to obtain a platform in the Chinese Market to expand and introduce
our GlamSmile Asia concept into the Chinese Market. In order to sell into the Chinese Market, an approval by Chinese Authorities
is required, in the form of licenses. As GlamSmile Asia was already the owner of such licenses prior to the acquisition, this was
an important advantage. We obtained control of GlamSmile Asia through the acquisition of the 50.98% interest and the appointment
of our CEO as a Board member of GlamSmile Asia. 

On January 30, 2014, the Company has sold
a total of 2,500,000 ordinary shares of its investment in GlamSmile Dental Technology Ltd for $3,000,000 and recognized a gain
on the sale in the amount of $1,582,597. As of March 31, 2014 the Company has received $1,850,000 and has recorded the balance
of $1,150,000 as an amount receivable. 

Effective March 31, 2014 the Company has
retained a 21.51% ownership in GlamSmile Asia Ltd.  

Deconsolidation  

On January 28, 2012, the Company entered
into a Preference A Shares and Preference A-1 Shares Purchase Agreement ( Share Purchase Agreement ) with Glamsmile
Dental Technology Ltd., a Cayman Islands company and a subsidiary of the Company ( Glamsmile Dental ), Glamsmile (Asia)
Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong and a substantially owned subsidiary of Glamsmile Dental,
Beijing Glamsmile Technology Development Ltd., Beijing Glamsmile Trading Co., Ltd., Beijing Glamsmile Dental Clinic Co., Ltd.,
and Shanghai Glamsmile Dental Clinic Co., Ltd., Gallant Network Limited, a shareholder of Glamsmile Dental ( Gallant ),
and IDG-Accel China Growth Fund III L.P. ( IDG Growth ), IDG-Accel China III Investors L.P.( IDG Investors )
and Crown Link Group Limited ( Crown )( IDG Growth, IDG Investors and Crown collectively referred to as the  Investors ),
pursuant to which the Investors agreed to (i) purchase from the Company an aggregate of 2,857,143 shares of Preference A-1 Shares
of Glamsmile Dental, which represents all of the issued and outstanding Preference A-1 Shares of Glamsmile Dental, for an aggregate
purchase price of $2,000,000, and (ii) purchase from Glamsmile Dental an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Preference A Shares for
an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000. 

Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement,
the Company agreed (a) to indemnify the Investors and their respective affiliates for losses arising out of a breach, or inaccuracy
or misrepresentation in any representation or warranty made by the Company or a breach or violation of a covenant or agreement
made by the Company for up to $1,500,000, and (b) to transfer 500,000 shares of Glamsmile Dental owned by the Company to the Investors
in the event of breach of certain covenants by the Company. In connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company also agreed
to enter into an Investor s Rights Agreement, Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement, and Voting Agreement with the
parties. 

In addition, in connection with the contemplated
transactions in the Share Purchase Agreement on January 20, 2012, the Company entered into a Distribution, License and Manufacturing
Agreement with Glamsmile Dental pursuant to which the Company appointed Glamsmile Dental as the exclusive distributor and licensee
of Glamsmile Veneer Products bearing the  Glamsmile  name and mark in the B2C Market in the People s Republic
of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Republic of China (Taiwan) and granted related manufacturing rights and licenses in
exchange for the original issuance of 2,857,143 shares of Preference A-1 Shares of Glamsmile Dental and $250,000 (the receipt of
which was acknowledged as an offset to payment of certain invoices of Glamsmile (Asia) Limited). 

On February 10, 2012, the sale of the Preference
A-1 Shares and the Preference A Shares was completed. As a result of the closing, the equity ownership of Glamsmile Dental, on
an as converted basis, is as follows: 31.4% by the Investors, 39.2 % by Gallant, and 29.4% by the Company. Mr. De Vreese, our chairman,
will remain as a director of Glamsmile Dental along with Mr. David Lok, who is the Chief Executive Officer and director of Glamsmile
Dental and principal of Gallant. The Investors have a right to appoint one director of Glamsmile Dental, and accordingly the Board
of Directors of Glamsmile Dental will consist of Mr. De Vreese, Mr. Lok and a director appointed by the Investors. 

In conjunction with the transaction and
resulting deconsolidation of Glamsmile Dental, the Company recorded a gain of $1,470,776, calculated as follows: 

For the six month periods ended September
30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 the Company recorded equity income of $149,222 and $129,131 respectively as  Other income 
for its portion of the net income recorded by GlamSmile Dental Technology Ltd. 

The following tables represent the summary
financial information of GlamSmile Asia as derived from its financial statements and prepared under US GAAP: 

MEDICAL FRANCHISES
  INVESTMENTS / CONDOR INTERNATIONAL  

Effective March 31, 2013, the Company acquired
6.12 % of the issued and outstanding shares of Medical Franchises   Investments N.V., a Belgium corporation ( MFI NV )
in exchange for a cash prepayment of $314,778 that was made during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012. The Company s
investment in 70,334 shares of MFI NV has been recorded at the fair value of $787,339 which is the quoted market price of approximately
USD $11.19 ( 8.70) per share. Future unrealized gains and losses on the investment in MFI will also be recognized in other
comprehensive income until realized. 

Per ASC-320-10-25-1, investments in debt
and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and are not classified as trading or held-to-maturity securities,
are classified as available-for-sale securities. 

MFI NV has been founded
to market an advance in dental technology which has the potential to replace the process of making mechanical impressions
of teeth and bite structures with a digital/optical scan. At the beginning of the current quarter, the Company was
officially renamed from  Medical Franchises   Investments (MFI NV) to  Condor International  (Condor
Intl NV) as such bearing the name of its major product, a 3D scanner. 

4.      CONCENTRATION OF RISK   

Financial Instruments   Financial
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade accounts receivable. 

Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to trade receivables are normally limited due to the number of customers comprising the Company s customer base and their
dispersion across different geographic areas.  At September 30, 2016, five customers accounted for 67.35% of the Company s
trade accounts receivables, and two customers accounted for 51.72%.  At September 30, 2015, five customers accounted for 70.05%
of the Company s trade accounts receivables, and two customers accounted for 55.06%.   The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and normally does not require collateral to support accounts receivable. 

Purchases   The Company has diversified

16.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The FASB ASC topic 820 on fair value measurement
and disclosures establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (referred to as Level 1), observable inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability either directly or indirectly (referred to as Level 2), and unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that
are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities (referred to as Level 3). 

The carrying values and fair values of our financial instruments
are as follows: 

The following method was used to estimate the fair values of
our financial instruments: 

The carrying amount of level 1 and level 2 financial instruments
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments. 

Financial assets are considered Level 3
when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least
one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial assets also include certain investment securities
for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. 

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy
classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels
for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of levels
within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused
the transfer occurs. There were no significant transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during the six month period ended
September 30, 2016. When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon
the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. The following table provides a reconciliation
of the beginning and ending balances of the item measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the table above that used significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

Item 2.  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward Looking Statements  

The discussion contained
herein is for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016.  In addition
to historical information, this section contains  forward-looking  statements, including statements regarding the growth
of product lines, optimism regarding the business, expanding sales and other statements. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, sees, estimates and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult
to predict. Actual results could vary materially from the description contained herein due to many factors including continued
market acceptance of our products. In addition, actual results could vary materially based on changes or slower growth in the oral
care and cosmetic dentistry products market; the potential inability to realize expected benefits and synergies; domestic and international
business and economic conditions; changes in the dental industry; unexpected difficulties in penetrating the oral care and cosmetic
dentistry products market; changes in customer demand or ordering patterns; changes in the competitive environment including pricing
pressures or technological changes; technological advances; shortages of manufacturing capacity; future production variables impacting
excess inventory and other risk factors.  Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences are discussed in
 Risk Factors  and elsewhere in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed on June 29, 2015 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation
to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2016. The information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30,
2016 is not a complete description of the Company s business or the risks associated with an investment in the Company s
common stock. Each reader should carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the Company in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q and in the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Overview  

We specialize in the research, development,
and manufacturing of oral care and cosmetic dentistry products.  We are one of the leading manufacturers of cosmetic
dentistry products in Europe.  Leveraging our knowledge of regulatory requirements regarding dental products and management s
experience in the needs of the professional dental community, we design, develop, manufacture and distribute our cosmetic dentistry
products, including a full line of professional dental products that are distributed in Europe, Asia and the United States.  We
distribute our products using both our own internal sales force and through the use of third party distributors. 

Results of Operations  

Comparative detail of results as a percentage of sales is as
follows: 

Net Sales  

Net sales decreased by approximately 11.9%
to $609,964 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $692,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The
decrease in sales is primarily due to the impact of the exchange rate USD versus EURO. As 100 % of our sales are generated outside
of the USA, all our sales are invoiced in Euros. Comparing the total Euro amounts of sales indicated a sales decrease of 12,55%,
or   545,654 for the total sales generated during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to   614,160 for the
total sales generated during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

The decrease
in sales in comparing our results in Euros is primarily due to the seasonal effect of the summer holidays known for its
reduced economic activity on top of the uncertain European situation due to  Brexit.  

Net sales decreased by approximately 19.3%
to $1,225,913 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1, 519,583 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. In
comparing our results in Euros, total sales decreased by 20.49% to   1,098,433 for the six months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to   1,323,511 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

Additionally, the decrease in sales should
also be seen in light of the uncertain European situation due to  Brexit , which was continuously in the media, slowing
down temporally the European economic activities. 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales increased approximately 3.1%
to $206,495 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $200,244 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, has increased to 33.85% in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 28.93%
in the quarter ended September 30 2015. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to increased raw material and production
costs. 

Cost of sales decreased approximately 14.9%
to $396,826 or the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $466,144 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Cost
of sales decreased primarily because by 15.14% to  312,843 for six month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to  
360,216 for the six months period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales is mainly due to our reduced sales for
the six months period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to last year s six months period ended September 30, 2015. 

Gross Profit  

Our gross profit decreased by $88,484 or
18% to $403,469 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $491,953 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. Our gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 66.15% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
71.07% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Our gross profit decreased by $224,352 or
21.3%, to $829,087 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,053,439 for the six months ended September 30,
2015 primarily because of the decrease in sales for the six months period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the six months
period ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating Expenses  

Research and Development .  Our
research and development expenses decreased to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,635 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 a decrease of 100.0%. The decrease in our research and development costs was primarily because
of the finalization of our Software program the  Smile Me Mirror . 

Our research and development costs increased
by $2,461 or 47.1% to $7.691 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $5,230 for the six months ended September
30, 2015. 

Sales and marketing costs . Our sales
and marketing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $114,532 and $91,906 respectively, representing
an increase of $22,626 or 24.6%.  The increase is largely due to increasing our sales staff. 

Our sales and marketing costs increased
by $87,876 or 48.3% to $269,716 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $181,840 for the six months ended September
30, 2015 because of hiring new people for our sales force. 

General and administrative costs .
Our general and administrative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $308,880 and $310,260 respectively,
representing a decrease of $1,380, or 0.4%. Our general and administrative costs for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $527,800 and $531,824 respectively, representing a decrease of $4,024 or 0.8%.  The decrease in general and
administration costs is largely due to increased synergy between our internal divisions as a result of ongoing internal reorganization. 

Depreciation and amortization .   Our
depreciation and amortization was $40,851 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $40,169 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.   Our depreciation and amortization was $81,439 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
versus $79,880 for the three months ended September 30, 2015..  The slight variation in depreciation and amortization
is not material. 

Other income.    Our net
other income was $98,897 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $32,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase in other income of $66,897.    The increase in other income was primarily because of increased
equity income from our investments. Our net other income increased by $55,669 to $178,407 for the six months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to $122,738 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, for the same reason as the three month variance. 

Internal and External Sources of Liquidity  

As of September 30,
2016, we had current assets of $2,780,567 compared to $2,858,534 at March 31, 2016. The decrease of $77,967 was due to a decrease
of accounts receivable of $28,548, decrease in inventories of $20,754 and decrease in prepaid expenses of $31,797, offset by an
increase in cash of $3,132. 

As of September 30,
2016, we had cash of $97,566. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds to satisfy our working capital requirements
and implement our business strategy to expand our direct to consumer business model. We intend to continue to look for opportunities
to expand the number of GlamSmile Studios in Europe.  We will continue to review our expected cash requirements,
make all efforts to collect any aged receivables, and take appropriate cost reduction measures to ensure that we have sufficient
working capital to fund our operations. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we may seek to raise additional funds
from a combination of sources including issuance of debt or equity securities. Additional financing may not be available on terms
favorable to us, or at all. Any additional financing activity could be dilutive to our current stockholders. If adequate funds
are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or
respond to competitive pressures could be limited. 

Cash and Cash equivalents  

Our balance sheet at September 30, 2016
reflects cash of $97,566 as compared to $94,434 as of March 31, 2016, an increase of $3,132. 

Operations  

Net cash provided by operations was $18,132
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used by operations of $231,918 for the six months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease of $250,050 in net cash used by operations for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
six months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily because of decreased income of $120,379, decreased accrued liabilities of $75,063,
increased equity income of $61,941, decreased deferred revenue of $39,734, decreased prepaid expenses of 102,856, an increase in
accounts payable of $213,958, and decreased amounts due to related parties of $25,069. 

Investing activities  

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
$28,910 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used by investing activities of $19,552 for the six
months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily for investing
in equipment. 

Financing activities  

During the six months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015, we recognized an increase/ (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents of $13,910 and $264, respectively,
from the effect of exchange rates between the Euro and the US Dollar.

At September 30, 2016, we did not have any
transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.

Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
