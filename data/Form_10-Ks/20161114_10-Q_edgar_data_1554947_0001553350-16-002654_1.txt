  1.  
  Organization and Nature of Operations  
   
 Interups Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 11, 2012. Until the change of control which took place as reported in a Form 8-K Report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2014, the Company was in the business of developing an internet based group buying site.  As reported in that Form 8-K, the then-principal shareholder, Romanas Bagdonas, sold all of his 4,000,000 shares of the Company, representing 57.97% of our issued and outstanding shares, to Laxmi Prasad, who is now the principal shareholder.  As part of that transaction, Mr. Bagdonas resigned as the sole officer and director, and designated Likhitha Palaypu, Laxmi Prasad s daughter, as the sole officer and director.  Also, the Company sold all of its then-existing assets and business back to Mr. Bagdonas for $1.  The Company is now in the business of identifying and investing into, and acquiring potential business opportunities or transactions, and conducting and offering turnkey services in India. On April 27, 2016, the Company announced its change in status and ceased to be a  shell,  as that term is defined in Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
   
   Going Concern   
   
 These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at August 31, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $2,444,071 and an accumulated deficit of $2,491,483. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company s future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   
   
  2.  
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 a) 
 Basis of Presentation 
   
 The unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is May 31. 
   
 b) 
 Interim Financial Statements 
   
 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In management s opinion the financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended May 31, 2017. For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016 included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 
   
 c) 
 Use of Estimates 
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
   
 d) 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As of August 31 and May 31, 2016, there were no cash equivalents. 
   
 e) 
 Revenue Recognition 
   
 The Company recognizes and accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC 605 as a principal on the services provided. Pursuant to ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition,  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the amount is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
   
 f) 
 Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share  
   
 The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 
   
 g) 
 Financial Instruments 
   
 Pursuant to ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
   
 Level 1 
 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

2.  
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 
   
 (g) 
 Financial Instruments (continued) 
   
 Level 2 
 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.  
   
 Level 3 
 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
   
 The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 
   
 (h) 
 Income Taxes 
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
   
 (i) 
 Comprehensive Loss 
   
 ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at August 31 and May 31, 2016, the Company has no items representing comprehensive income or loss. 
   
 (j) 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

As at August 31, 2016, the Company recorded $75 in shares issuable for the issuance of 7,500 restricted shares of common stock, which reflects the pro-rata portion of the services provided prior to the director's resignation as CFO of the Company. 
   
 (f) 
 On August 15, 2016, the Company entered into a services agreement with a director of the Company for director and officer services. In consideration, the Company agreed to compensation of $240,000 per annum, which will increase based on certain performance milestones being achieved. The Company also agreed to pay director payments of not less than $50,000 per annum without the director of the Company's consent, payable quarterly. 
   
  8.  Subsequent Events  
   
  a .    Events that have had additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet and are likely or reasonably likely to affect or impact the estimates inherent in the process of preparing    future    financial statements.  
   
  Certain Asset Purchases or Substantial Equity Investments disclosed in 8-K filings.   The extended agreement dates for acquiring or substantially investing into Lavasa Corporation, Birla Shloka and Windflower have all expired and as at the date of this filing. Registrant is yet to approach and obtain any extension, nor has the Registrant received an agreement termination notice from any of these firms. While there are no obligations or liabilities or material risks associated with the acquisition not taking place in any of these transactions, it is a material subsequent event (with evidence existing as of Aug 31, 2016) that would not impact the current financial condition of the Company but which would future projections based on which the Company is attempting to raise additional capital.  
   
  b. Events that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet being reported on but arose subsequent to that date:    
   
 a) 
 On 10/31/16, Registrant extended the term of one promissory note dated 6/13/16 for $125,000 to 12/31/2016. 
   
 b) 
 Effective November 1, 2016, Registrant initiated efforts to raise capital from outside of the United States, from certain non-US persons under Regulation S of the US Securities Act of 1933.

  (UNAUDITED)  

c) 
 In October 2016, Registrant held negotiations with a prominent Mutual Fund sponsored by one of India s premier national banks, to act as Investment Manager for investments which the Registrant intends to bring into India from the United States by organizing a Private Equity firm and associating with an identified US registered Investment Company as the referral/introducing agent for structuring and placing India-focused investment products through registered and licensed broker dealers to certain investors desiring to invest into the Indian markets in certain classes of assets. Although the Registrant is spending considerable money towards this initiative, there is no guarantee that it will succeed in this effort, and its failure to succeed would be a material loss to the Company, so much so that it might even jeopardize its survival and existence. 
   
 d) 
 In October 2016, Registrant also held discussions with one of India s largest financial services providers to partner and engage as introducing / referring agents to certain US based online firms, enabling qualified Indian Residents who want to open US Broker Accounts and trade in the US Markets. The Registrant also discussed with this prospective partner a plan to help and identify certain qualified clients who desire to receive the services of the Registrant in the Registrant s effort to switch business management and control to the US, and strategically attract global capital markets in their growth ambition.  Although the Registrant is spending considerable money towards this initiative, there is no guarantee that it will succeed in this effort and its failure to succeed would be a material loss to the Company, so much so that it might even jeopardize its survival and existence.  
   
 There are material risks associated with some of these acquisitions/transactions not taking place, as described above, which have impacted the current financial condition of the Company, and which could affect future projections, based on which the Company is attempting to raise additional capital.

 Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
   
     Working Capital   

Cash Flows   

Operating Revenues   
   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company did not earn any revenues. 
   
   Operating Expenses and Net Loss   
   
   Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015   
   
 Operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 were $1,230,357 compared to $13,150 during the three months ended August 31, 2015. The large increase is due to a significant increase in operating activity, including consulting expense of $1,010,883 and increase in general and administrative expense of $94,354 for rent and travel expenses. Furthermore, the Company incurred an increase of $125,120 of professional fees related to an increase in time required for the Company s legal counsel and accountants. 
   
   During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,242,048 compared to $13,150 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. The Company incurred a loss per share of $0.18 during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $0.00 per share during the three months ended August 31, 2015.   In addition to the operating expenses noted above, the Company also incurred interest expense of $11,691 in the current period. 

11 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 At August 31, 2016, the Company had cash of $12,211 and total assets of $41,035 compared to cash of $7,197 and total assets of $77,995 as at May 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and total assets was due to a decrease in prepaid expenses of $41,974, offset by an increase in cash of $5,014. 
   
 At August 31, 2016, the Company had total liabilities of $2,485,106 compared to liabilities of $1,280,093 as at May 31, 2016. The increase in liabilities was due to an increase in amounts due to related parties of $519,242, increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 394,171, and increase in loans payable of $291,600. 
   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company did not have any equity transactions. 
   
   Cash Flow from Operating Activities   
   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company used cash of $413,186 for operating activity compared to $nil for the three months ended August 31, 2015. The increase in cash used for operating activities is due to the fact that the Company received funding during the period and incurred significantly more operating activity. 
   
   Cash Flow from Investing Activities   
   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company did not have any investing activities. 
   
   Cash Flow from Financing Activities   
   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company received $418,200 in cash from financing activities relating to proceeds received from loans payable issued of $291,600 and proceeds from related parties of $126,600. During the three months ended August 31, 2015, the Company did not have any financing activities. 
   
   Going Concern   
   
 We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing. 
   
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 
   
   Future Financings   
   
 We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares, and loans from related and/or unrelated parties, in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 
   
   Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

12 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 
   
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 Our company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and our company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
   
 As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
   
  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 The term  disclosure controls and procedures  (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e)) refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods.  Disclosure controls and procedures  include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer noted the deficiencies in internal controls identified in this Item 4. Accordingly, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, such controls and procedures were not effective. 
   
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 using the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). 
   
   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
   We do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is management's view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company's financial statements. Currently, we have two members on the Audit Committee, but neither is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management's activities .   However, the Company is in discussions with an independent search firm to elect independent members to its Board and Audit Committee.   

13 

2. 
   We did not maintain appropriate cash controls   We did not maintain appropriate cash controls   As of August 31, 2016, we are yet to establish sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for treasury management, including segregation of cash handling at various operational levels, and requiring dual signatures on the Company s bank accounts over and above certain dollar amounts per transaction. The effects of poor cash controls were somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in its bank accounts during that period, and that the accounting function, including review, preparation and reporting of financial statements per PCAOB norms, was endorsed to third party independent professional accountants. 

3. 
   We did not implement appropriate information technology controls   As at August 31, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company's data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.  However, we signed up with an online data storage facility and Google Mail, to electronically store and back up certain critical documents. 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company's internal controls. 
   
 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
   
  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
   
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, that occurred during our current fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management' s report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. 

14 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    
   
 Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.
