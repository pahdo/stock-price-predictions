      Table of Contents           PART I       ITEM 1. BUSINESS      FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.     GENERAL     AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP. (the "Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 ("Inception") and originally intended to purchase used cars in the United States and sell them in Krygyzstan. The Company's fiscal year end is August 31.     On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investor Jianli Deng, the Company's current Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. After the stock sale, the Company modified its business plan and presently intends to focus on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine.     We may borrow funds from our officers and shareholders for working capital, however, they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. We are a development stage company and have generated $28,200 [year ended August 31,2016] in revenue under our new business plan.                  3       
      Table of Contents           We plan to be in the business of mobile app marketing for movie trailer promotion thru a mobile smartphone app in China. We plan to generate a subscriber base of smartphone users primarily through pre-installed app smartphone makers, online app stores, WeChat official accounts, Weibo and other social network medis and sell prepaid cards or coins to movie distributors or other video advertisers in China. We have created the app  Amoney  (available for download on http://fir.im/aMoney and QR code as well) for the Android smartphone platform to develop a WeChat micro-shop (see this for reference: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/062416/silicon-valley-eyeing-chinas-wechat-fb-aapl.asp ) that will display and deliver a variety of information and links for download or online watch prices in the China market, and will advertise our services and fees. During FYE August 31, 2016, we generated revenue of $28,200 from one company that paid us to post their movie trailers on our smartphone app for a one month period.       ITEM 1A.

Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol  ABQQ . To date there has been one trade in our common stock. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a Company s operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be an established public trading market in the future for our common stock.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA      Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item      ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.     General     AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP. (the "Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 ("Inception") and originally intended to purchase used cars in the United States and sell them in Krygyzstan. The Company's fiscal year end is August 31.     On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investor Jianli Deng, the Company's current Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. After the change of control, the Company modified its business plan and presently intends to focus on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine.     We may borrow funds from our officers and shareholders for working capital, however, they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. We are a development stage company and have generated $28,200 [in the year ended August 31,2016] in revenue under our new business plan, and a total of $36,400 in revenue, including continued and discontinued operations, since our inception on July 29, 2013.                 6       
      Table of Contents          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.     We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the funds we require to implement our business plan.     FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2015     REVENUE     During the year ended August 31, 2016 we generated $28,200 (2015, $8,200 discontinued operations) in revenue.      COST OF GOODS SOLD     We recognized an expense of $0 for cost of services sold during the year ended August 31, 2016 compared to $7,000 for cost of goods sold, from discontinued operations during the year ended August 31, 2015.     Operating Expenses     During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we incurred total expenses of $64,879 from continuing operations, and $7,810 from discontinued operations, compared to $28,605 from discontinued operations during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015.     The increase between the two periods was due to the increased scale and scope of our business operations, as well as an increase in salary and wages paid to related parties of $15,000.      Net Losses     Our net loss from continued operations of $36,679, and net loss of $7,810 from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $28,605 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 due to the factors described above, offset by increased revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016     As of August 31, 2016, our total assets were $314,498 comprised of $167,413 in cash, of which $587 has been classified as assets from discontinued operations, $28,200 in accounts receivable, $22,501 in prepaid expenses and $96,384 of Intangible Assets, and $0 in fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation. Our total liabilities were $80,023 comprised of $2,797 in advances from a related party and $77,226 in accounts payable. Stockholders  equity was $234,475 as of August 31, 2016.                   7       
      Table of Contents          FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2015     As of August 31, 2015, our net liabilities of discontinued operations was $6,779. Stockholders  deficit was $6,779 as of August 31, 2015.       Cash Flows from Operating Activities      We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities were ($5,729) and ($35,384) respectively. The decrease between the two periods reflects primarily the increase of accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, as well as the increase in accounts payable.       Cash Flows from Investing Activities      There was $30,000 cash used in the purchase of Intangible Assets for the period ended August 31, 2016. An additional $70,000 was recorded as a payable in relation to Intangible Asset which had a total purchase price of $100,000. No cash flows from investing activities were noted for the fiscal years ended, August 31, 2015.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities      We have financed our operations primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock and by way of a loan from a shareholder. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash flows from financing activities were $266,697 and $39,900 respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2016, $263,600 was received from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to both related and unrelated parties, as well as $300 provided from loans from a previous shareholder, and $2,797 due to current shareholder. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, $22,800 was received from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and $17,100 from proceeds from our shareholder loan.         PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING     The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (July 29, 2013) resulting in an accumulated deficit from continuing operations of ($36,679) as of August 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.        The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.                  8       
      Table of Contents          We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.     MATERIAL COMMITMENTS     As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.     PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT     We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS     As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.     GOING CONCERN     The independent auditors' report accompanying our August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

      Table of Contents             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM       Board of Directors  AB International Group, Corp.  Hong Kong     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet AB International Group, Corp. as of August 31, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity/ (deficit) and cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.     We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AB International Group, Corp. as of August 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  The Company has suffered losses from inception and has a limited operating history which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of AB International Group, Corp. as of August 31, 2015, the related statement of operations, changes in shareholders  deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.     We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AB International Group Corp. as of August 31, 2015 and the related statement of operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

      Table of Contents           AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP, CORP.     NOTES TO   CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     AUGUST 31, 2016       NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS      AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP. (the  Company ,  we  or  us ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 ( Inception ) and originally intended to purchase used cars in the United States and sell them in Krygyzstan. The Company s fiscal year end is August 31.     On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investors. Subsequently, the Company modified its business plan and is currently focusing on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine to be used for movie trailer promotion thru a mobile smartphone app in China.        NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of Presentation      The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company s year -end is August 31. The financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis, with their fully owned subsidiary App Board Limited. No intercompany balances or transactions exist during the period ended August 31, 2016.     On January 22, 2016, the Company modified its business plan, and therefore the Company has classified all transactions and balances prior to the modification of the business plan as Discontinued Operations in the financial statements.      Basis of Consolidation        The financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis, with the Company s fully owned subsidiary App Board Limited. No intercompany balances or transactions exist during the period ended August 31, 2016.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.      Foreign Currency Transactions        The Company s planned operations are outside of the United States, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The financial risk arise from the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degrees of volatility in these rates. Currently the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates and monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the end of the year.  Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the year.  Gains and losses from translation of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in current results of operations.      Accounts Receivable      Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from promotional services provided. Amounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. No amount for bad debt expense has been recorded by the company.                 F-8       
      Table of Contents           Prepaid Expenses      Prepaids consist of filing fees and advances related to consulting fees that have been paid in advance. The prepaid balances are amortized when the related expense is incurred.      Intangible Assets      Intangible assets are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 5 years. The intangible assets are mobile application product that is used to generate sales by utilizing the mobile app as advertising for third parties, events, or products.          Income Taxes      The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740   Income Taxes  . Under ASC 740 deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.                 F-9       
      Table of Contents          ASC 740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At August 31, 2016, there were no unrecognized tax benefits.      Revenue Recognition      The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605,  Revenue Recognition  ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. The Company has recognized the revenues associated mobile app sales once the criteria has been met, the product has been delivered, and the Company has received payment from the vendor.      Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share      The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings per Share  which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.     No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.      Recent accounting pronouncements      We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company other than those relating to the revised requirements related to revenue recognition, which are required subsequent to December 15, 2016.            NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN      The Company has an accumulated deficit of $36,679 from continuing operations, and a deficit of $40,189 from discontinued operations as of August 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.       The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.       NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      In support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.      From July 29, 2013 through August 31, 2015, the Company's previous sole director loaned the Company $22,406 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. The loan was non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. Thereafter, this director advanced another $300 to the Company for operating expenses and the Company's computer was disposed to this director for a value $563. On January 15, 2016, the $22,143 balance of the loan was forgiven by this director and was recorded as additional paid-in capital. As at August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company owed $0 and $22,406 to this director, respectively.      On June 1, 2016, the Company sold 10,000,000 shares of its common stock to the Company s sole director at $0.01.     During the year ended August 31, 2016, $15,000 was paid to two related parties as salaries and wages.     The Company had management fees to the current sole director of $2,087 for the year ending August 31, 2016. As of August 31, 2016, the Company owed $2,797 to the current sole director.            NOTE 5   EQUITY      The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.     During the year ended August 31, 2016, the company issued 12,780,000 common shares, par value of $0.01, for proceeds of $163,600 to four unrelated parties.     On June 3, 2016, the Company sold 10,000,000 shares of its common stock to a related party (an executive officer and sole director of the Company) at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $100,000. The shares were sold pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Rule 506 of Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, constitute "restricted securities" as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Act, and contain a standard restrictive legend. The funds were received by the Company on June 3, 2016.      As at August 31, 2016, 26,150,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by approximately 11 shareholders of record.      NOTE 6   INCOME TAXES      As of August 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $73,251 that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income through 2035. Subsequent to the Company's change in control, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $36,679. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. Due to the change in control during the year, the Company is expecting limitations on the loss carry forward amounts. that were generated prior to the change in control.     Components of net deferred tax assets, including a valuation allowance, are as follows at August 31, 2016 and 2015:                   The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2016 was $25,628, and $11,333 as of August 31, 2015. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of August 31, 2016 and 2015.     Reconciliation between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows at August 31, 2016 and 2015:            NOTE 7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to August 31, 2016 to the date these financial statements were issued and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):                   (a)     All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and                (b)     Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
