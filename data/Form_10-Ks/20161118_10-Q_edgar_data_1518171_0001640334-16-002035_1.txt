     Table of Contents        MEDIA ANALYTICS CORPORATION    NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   September 30, 2016  (Unaudited)      NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS      Media Analytics Corporation (formerly FanSport, Inc.) (the "Company") is a company that was incorporated on March 16, 2011, and intends to develop and provide social gaming mobile applications for fantasy sports enthusiasts. Effective September 3, 2013, the Company changed its name from FanSport, Inc. to Media Analytics Corporation. The Company is focused on developing or acquiring software that helps companies track their social data. Currently the Company is the West Coast Distributor of Klarity (http://www.klarityanalytics.com).       NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Accounting Basis      These condensed interim financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 included in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      Cash and cash equivalents are reported in the balance sheet at cost, which approximates fair value. For the purpose of the financial statements cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.      Earnings (Loss) per Share      The Company adopted FASB ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There were no diluted or potentially diluted shares outstanding for all periods presented.       Dividends      The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. On October 3, 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a forward stock split by way of a stock dividend of two (2) authorized but unissued shares of its common stock on each one (1) issued and outstanding share of its common stock held by shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014. The payment date for the stock dividend was November 10, 2014, as determined by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Upon the payment of the stock dividend, the Company had 300,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which represents an increase of 200,000,000 shares over its prior total of 100,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The split is reflected retrospectively in the accompanying financial statements.                 8       
     Table of Contents        MEDIA ANALYTICS CORPORATION   NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  September 30, 2016  (Unaudited)      NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - C ontinued        Income Taxes      The Company adopted FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes , at its inception. Under FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of September 30, 2016 or March 31, 2016, respectively.      Fair Value of Financial Investments      The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable approximates the carrying amount of these financial instruments due to their short term maturity.       Advertising      The Company will expense advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was $0 for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Revenue and Cost Recognition      The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost.      Related Parties      Related parties, which can be a corporation, individual, investor or another entity are considered to be related if the party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the Company in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. The Company has these relationships.                 9       
     Table of Contents          MEDIA ANALYTICS CORPORATION   NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  September 30, 2016  (Unaudited)      NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - C ontinued        Property      The Company does not own any real estate or other property. The Company's office is located at 800 West El Camino Real, Mountain View, CA, 94040.       Recent Authoritative Accounting Pronouncements      The Company has reviewed the Accounting Standards Updates through ASU No. 2016-17 and these updates have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant.       NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES      The Company provides for income taxes under ASC Topic 740 which requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently.      ASC Topic 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company's opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Therefore, the net deferred tax asset in the amount of $198,173 and income tax expense have been fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount at September 30, 2016, leaving a balance of $0. The Company reviews tax positions taken to determine if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination resulting in an uncertain tax position. The Company did not have any material unrecognized tax benefit at September 30, 2016. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. During the period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized no interest and penalties.     The Company has filed all income tax returns since inception. Tax periods since 2012 remain open to examination by the taxing jurisdiction to which the Company is subject.     At September 30, 2016, the Company had net loss carry forwards of $582,863 which expire through its tax year ending 2036. Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards may be limited in accordance with IRC Section 382 in the event of certain shifts in ownership.      NOTE 4. DUE TO RELATED PARTY      Amount due to related party at September 30, 2016, is non-interest bearing, unsecured and with no fixed terms of repayment.       NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT       Preferred Stock      There are 10,000,000 Preferred Shares at $0.0001 par value authorized with none issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.            MEDIA ANALYTICS CORPORATION   NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  September 30, 2016  (Unaudited)      NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT  -   Continued        Common Stock      On February 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation which affected a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock on a thirty (30) old for one (1) new basis. No cash was paid or distributed as a result of the forward stock split and no fractional shares were issued. All fractional shares, which would otherwise be required to be issued as a result of the stock split, were rounded up to the nearest whole share. There was no change in the par value of our common stock. The split is reflected retrospectively in the accompanying financial statements.     There are 16,666,667 common shares at $0.0001 par value authorized with 10,000,629 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016.       NOTE 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      An officer and director of the Company is involved in business activities outside of the Company and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities that become available. They may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.     Effective August 19, 2015, the CEO of the Company resigned and a new director was appointed for the position.      As of September 30, 2016, loan payable to the CEO of the Company was $127,801 ($123,001   March 31, 2016). The purpose of the loan was to pay for current administrative expense. The loan is due on demand and bears no interest.       NOTE 7. GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the period March 16, 2011 (date of inception) through September 30, 2016 the Company has had a net loss of $582,863. In view of these matters, recoverability of any asset amounts shown in the accompanying condensed interim financial statements is dependent upon the Company's ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities from the sale of equity securities. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from loans and the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations, if ever, are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.            MEDIA ANALYTICS CORPORATION   NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  September 30, 2016  (Unaudited)      NOTE 8. CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS       Cash Balances      The Company maintains its cash in institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). All other deposit accounts at FDIC-insured institutions were insured up to at least $250,000 per depositor until December 31, 2009. On April 1, 2010, FDIC deposit insurance for all deposit accounts, except for certain retirement accounts, returned to $250,000 per depositor. Insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, which include all IRA deposit accounts, will remain at $250,000 per depositor. Our cash balance at September 30, 2016 was below the FDIC insurance threshold.      NOTE 9. COMMITMENT      On September 11, 2013, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Social Media Broadcasts (SMB) Limited wherein the Company will have the right to the sales and marketing of the Klarity Analytic Dashboard in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom (including the Republic of Ireland) for an initial period of two years and for successive periods of one year each upon mutual agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement the Company shall pay to Social Media Broadcasts the following license fees:                  (a)    an initial nonrefundable fixed fee of US$300,000 payable in installments over 3 years;                   (b)    an annual technical support fee of US$60,000; and                   (c)    a 20% royalty payment on all sales of Klarity.         The Company's social media tools and solutions will enable advertisers, publishers and agencies in the U.S. and U.K. markets to gather deep social intelligence, generate true engagement and simplify promotional management. The Company's current offering as a result of the license agreement, Klarity, is a comprehensive and robust social analytics dashboard available. Klarity provides detailed comparative metrics from the widest range of social platforms, and provides the added uniqueness for Western marketers to gain insights into the social behavior of Asian consumers.     The Company's former CEO is also the CEO of Social Media Broadcasts (SMB) Limited.     The Company suspended the business venture relating to the SMB licensing agreement.     The Company has been unable to make any of the SMB licensing agreement payments as required under the agreement. As a result, effective October 28, 2015 the Company and SMB have consented to a cancellation and termination of the licensing agreement.      NOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based on our evaluation no events have occurred that require disclosure.             Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Forward-Looking Statements      This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "could", "may", "will", "should", "expect", "plan", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "predict", "potential" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.     Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable laws, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements so as to conform these statements to actual results.     Our unaudited financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report.     As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms  we ,  us ,  our  and  our company  mean Media Analytics Corporation, a Florida corporation, unless otherwise indicated.      Corporate Overview      We were incorporated in the State of Florida on March 16, 2011 under the name FanSport, Inc. Our company's goal was to develop social media tools and solutions to enable advertisers, publishers and agencies in the North American and United Kingdom (including the Republic of Ireland) markets to gather deep social intelligence, generate true engagement and simplify promotional management. Our company was the official reseller of Klarity for the U.S. and U.K. markets. Klarity provides detailed comparative metrics from the widest range of social platforms, and provides the added uniqueness for western marketers to gain insights into the social behavior of Asian consumers.     On January 31, 2013, our board of directors approved a 20 for 1 forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As disclosed in the Information Statement on Schedule 14C as filed with the SEC on February 12, 2013, on February 11, 2013, our majority shareholder consented to this action. In conjunction therewith, we filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Florida, which became effective on February 27, 2013. The forward split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on February 25, 2013.     On June 17, 2013, our board of directors and a majority of our stockholders approved a change of name of our company from FanSport, Inc. to Media Analytics Corporation. Articles of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Florida Secretary of State on August 28, 2013, with an effective date of September 3, 2013.     The name change was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on September 3, 2013 under the symbol  MEDA . Our CUSIP number is 584393102.     On October 3, 2014, our board of directors approved a forward stock split by way of a stock dividend. In connection with the stock split, shareholders on record as of November 10, 2014, received two (2) shares of common stock for each one (1) share of common stock held on November 10, 2014. The pay-out date as approved by our board of directors and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was November 10, 2014. Upon completion of the stock split, our issued and outstanding shares increased from 100,000,000 shares of common stock to 300,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001.            On February 26, 2016, our company s board of directors, and a majority of our stockholders approved by resolution, a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a thirty (30) old for one (1) new basis. Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation for the reverse stock split were filed and became effective with the Florida Secretary of State on March 22, 2016. Consequently, our authorized share capital decreased from 500,000,000 shares of common stock to 16,666,667 shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 300,000,000 to 10,000,629 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.0001. The reverse split became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on March 30, 2016. Our CUSIP number is 584393 201.  Our business and registered office is located at 800 W. El Camino Real, Suite 180, Mountain View, California, 94040, our telephone number is 650 903-2224.       Our Current Business      It was the intention of our former management to introduce the Klarity Analytical Dashboard to the North American and United Kingdom marketplaces, where we had the exclusive license and reselling agreement. This would have allowed users to have access to in depth insights into western and Asian social behaviour. We are also looking to develop relationships with other analytical technology providers to provide an entire suite of marketing solutions to our clients.     We have no revenues, have achieved losses since inception, have no operations, have been issued a going concern opinion and rely upon the sale of our securities to fund operations.     On September 11, 2013, our company entered into a licensing agreement with Social Media Broadcasts (SMB) Limited wherein our company had the right to the sales and marketing of the Klarity Analytic Dashboard in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom (including the Republic of Ireland) for a period of two years. Pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement our company was required to pay to Social Media the following license fees:           On September 17, 2013, our company and Social Media amended the terms of the licensing agreement with the following changes:                 (a)  an initial non-refundable fixed fee of US$300,000, which has been negotiated to be payable in installments over a 3-year period against technical deliverables by Social Media to our company;                         (b)  an annual technical support fee of US$60,000, which includes product customization, enhancements and upgrades, as well as client technical support and servicing; and                         (c)  a 20% royalty payment on all sales of Klarity Analytic Dashboard.          Our company has been unable to make any of the foregoing payments as required under the agreement. As a result, the parties have consented to a cancellation and termination of the licensing agreement. We are currently negotiating a distribution agreement with Social Media, as well as investigating additional opportunities in our efforts to maintain and enhance shareholder value.      Results of Operations      The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.               Expenses       Our operating results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:            Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $6,314 resulting in a net loss for the period of $6,314 compared to a net loss of $22,161 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in expenses was due to inactivity. Total expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were $11,241 resulting in a net loss for the period of $11,241 compared to a net loss of $40,888 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in expenses was due to inactivity.       Liquidity and Capital Resources        Working Capital             Cash Flows            At September 30, 2016 we had working capital deficit of $137,049 as compared to working capital deficit of $125,808 at March 31, 2016.     Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,211 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $3,577 for the six months ended September 30, 2015.             Going Concern      Our financial statements for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis and contain an additional explanatory paragraph which identifies issues that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     We have not generated revenues, have achieved losses since our inception, and rely upon the sale of our common stock and proceeds from shareholder loans to fund our operations. If we are unable to raise equity or secure alternative financing, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business plan may fail.     If our operations and cash flow improve, management believes that we can continue to operate. However, no assurance can be given that management's actions will result in profitable operations or an improvement in our liquidity situation. The threat of our ability to continue as a going concern will cease to exist only when our revenues have reached a level able to sustain our business operations.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.      Critical Accounting Policies       Accounting Basis      Our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our company s fiscal year end is March 31.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      Cash and cash equivalents are reported in the balance sheet at cost, which approximates fair value. For the purpose of the financial statements cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.      Earnings (Loss) per Share      Our company adopted FASB ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our company s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our company s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There were no diluted or potentially diluted shares outstanding for all periods presented.              Dividends      Our company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. On October 3, 2014, our board of directors approved a forward stock split by way of a stock dividend of two (2) authorized but unissued shares of our common stock on each one (1) issued and outstanding share of its common stock held by shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014. The payment date for the stock dividend was November 10, 2014, as determined by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Upon the payment of the stock dividend, our company had 300,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which represents an increase of 200,000,000 shares over its prior total of 100,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The split is reflected retrospectively in the accompanying financial statements.       Income Taxes      Our company adopted FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes , at its inception. Under FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of September 30, 2016 or March 31, 2016, respectively.      Fair Value of Financial Investments      The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable approximates the carrying amount of these financial instruments due to their short-term maturity.       Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Related Parties      Related parties, which can be a corporation, individual, investor or another entity are considered to be related if the party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over our company in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. Our company has these relationships.             Recent Accounting Pronouncements       Our company has reviewed the Accounting Standards Updates through ASU No. 2016-17 and these updates have no current applicability to our company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      As of the end of our quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
