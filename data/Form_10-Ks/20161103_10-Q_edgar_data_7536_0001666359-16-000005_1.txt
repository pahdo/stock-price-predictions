  The estimated fair market value, using quoted market prices, is as follows: 

The carrying amount of the company's short-term borrowings in various countries, revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other obligations approximate their fair value. 
    
  The company has a   $1,500,000   revolving credit facility maturing in December 2018.  This facility may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness and acquisitions, and as support for the company's commercial paper program, as applicable.  Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (  1.30%   at   October 1, 2016  ), which is based on the company's credit ratings, or an effective interest rate of   1.72%   at   October 1, 2016  . The facility fee, which is based on the company's credit ratings, was   .20%   at   October 1, 2016  .  There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at October 1, 2016. The company had   $72,000   in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at   December 31, 2015  .

does not qualify for true sale treatment.  Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (  .40%   at   October 1, 2016  ), which is based on the company's credit ratings, or an effective interest rate of   1.07%   at   October 1, 2016  . The facility fee is   .40%  . 
    
  At   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the company had   $467,000   and   $75,000  , respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program, which was included in "Long-term debt" in the company's consolidated balance sheets. Total collateralized accounts receivable of approximately   $1,631,581   and   $1,871,831  , respectively, were held by AFC and were included in "Accounts receivable, net" in the company's consolidated balance sheets. Any accounts receivable held by AFC would likely not be available to other creditors of the company in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings before repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program.   
    
  Both the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels.  The company was in compliance with all covenants as of   October 1, 2016   and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future.   
    
  During February 2015, the company completed the sale of   $350,000   principal amount of   3.50%   notes due in 2022 and   $350,000   principal amount of   4.00%   notes due in 2025.  The net proceeds of the offering of   $688,162   were used to refinance the company's   3.375%   notes due November 2015 and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  During February 2015, the company redeemed   $250,000   principal amount of its   3.375%   notes due November 2015.  The related loss on the redemption for 2015 was   $2,943   and was recognized as a loss on prepayment of debt, which was included in "Other expense, net" in the company's consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  The company has a   $100,000   uncommitted line of credit.  There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Interest and other financing expense, net, includes interest and dividend income of   $1,874   and   $5,264   for the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016  , respectively. Interest and other financing expense, net, includes interest and dividend income of   $1,299   and   $3,761   for the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2015  , respectively. 

Note H   Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The company utilizes a fair value hierarchy, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The fair value hierarchy has three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
    
           Level 1 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 
       
           Level 2 
    Quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
       
           Level 3 
    Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The following table presents assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   December 31, 2015  : 

Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (see Note C and D). The company tests these assets for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist.  
    
  During the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , there were no transfers of assets (liabilities) measured at fair value between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. 

Available-For-Sale Securities 
    
  The company has an   8.4%   equity ownership interest in Marubun Corporation ("Marubun") and a portfolio of mutual funds with quoted market prices, all of which are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. 
    
  The fair value of the company's available-for-sale securities is as follows: 

The unrealized holding gains or losses on these investments are included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets. 

Derivative Instruments 
    
  The company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading.  Certain derivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market each reporting period with any unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings.

Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  The company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. The company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on a quarterly basis. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of designated interest rate swaps is recorded as a change to the carrying value of the related hedged debt. The ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, if any, is recorded in "Interest and other financing expense, net" in the company's consolidated statements of operations. As of October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all outstanding interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges.  
    
  The terms of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts at October 1, 2016 are as follows: 

Foreign Exchange Contracts 
    
  The company enters into foreign exchange forward, option, or swap contracts (collectively, the "foreign exchange contracts") to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  These contracts are executed to facilitate the hedging of foreign currency exposures resulting from inventory purchases, sales, and inter-company transactions and generally have terms of no more than six months. Gains or losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized when the underlying future purchase or sale is recognized or when the corresponding asset or liability is revalued. The company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes. The risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties, which the company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions.  The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts are estimated using market quotes for the applicable foreign exchange rate.  The notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $372,460   and   $382,025  , respectively. 
    
  Gains and losses related to non-designated foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in "Cost of sales" in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to designated foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in "Selling, general, and administrative expenses" in the company's consolidated statements of operations and were not material for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 and 2015.

Restructuring and Integration Accrual Summary 
    
  In summary, the restructuring and integration accruals aggregate to   $20,717   at   October 1, 2016  , all of which are expected to be spent in cash, and are expected to be utilized as follows: 

Other accruals of   $882   are expected to be spent within one year. 
       
  Other Charges 
    
  Included in restructuring, integration, and other charges for the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016   are fraud loss, acquisition-related, and other expenses of   $12,726   and   $35,556  , respectively. The company determined that it was the target of criminal fraud by persons impersonating a company executive, which resulted in unauthorized transfers of cash from a company account in Europe to outside bank accounts in Asia in January 2016.  Legal actions by the company and law enforcement are ongoing.  The information gathered by the company indicates that this is an isolated event not associated with a security breach or loss of data.  Additionally, no officers or employees of the company were involved in the fraud. During the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of 2016, the company recorded a fraud loss, net of insurance recoveries, of   $507   and   $4,449  , respectively. Included within  Other current assets  is approximately   $29,000   of cash frozen in outside bank accounts that the company believes is probable of recovery. Acquisition related charges for the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of 2016 of   $2,679   and   $7,645  , respectively, related to contingent consideration for acquisitions completed in prior years which were conditional upon the financial performance of the acquired companies and the continued employment of the selling shareholders, as well as professional and other fees directly related to recent acquisition activity. In the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016  , the company released a   $2,376   legal reserve related to the Tekelec Matter (see Note M) and incurred an additional expense of   $11,744   to increase its accrual for the Wyle Laboratories ("Wyle") environmental obligation (see Note M). During 2016, the company adopted an amendment to its Wyle defined benefit plan and incurred a settlement expense of   $12,211   during the   first nine months   of 2016.  
    
  Included in restructuring, integration, and other charges for the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2015   are acquisition-related expenses of   $5,267   and   $18,748  , respectively, consisting of charges related to contingent consideration for acquisitions completed in prior years which were conditional upon the financial performance of the acquired companies and the continued employment of the selling shareholders, as well as professional and other fees directly related to recent acquisition activity.

  Environmental Matters 
    
  In connection with the purchase of Wyle in August 2000, the company acquired certain of the then outstanding obligations of Wyle, including Wyle's indemnification obligations to the purchasers of its Wyle Laboratories division for environmental clean-up costs associated with any then existing contamination or violation of environmental regulations.  Under the terms of the company's purchase of Wyle from the sellers, the sellers agreed to indemnify the company for certain costs associated with the Wyle environmental obligations, among other things. In 2012, the company entered into a settlement agreement with the sellers pursuant to which the sellers paid   $110,000   and the company released the sellers from their indemnification obligation. As part of the settlement agreement, the company accepted responsibility for any potential subsequent costs incurred related to the Wyle matters. The company is aware of two Wyle Laboratories facilities (in Huntsville, Alabama and Norco, California) at which contaminated groundwater was identified and will require environmental remediation.  In addition, the company was named as a defendant in several lawsuits related to the Norco facility and a third site in El Segundo, California which have now been settled to the satisfaction of the parties. 
    
  The company expects these environmental liabilities to be resolved over an extended period of time.  Costs are recorded for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals for environmental liabilities are adjusted periodically as facts and circumstances change, assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.  Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to various unknown factors such as the timing and extent of remediation, improvements in remediation technologies, and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may change in the future. Accordingly, the company cannot presently fully estimate the ultimate potential costs related to these sites until such time as a substantial portion of the investigation at the sites is completed and remedial action plans are developed and, in some instances, implemented. To the extent that future environmental costs exceed amounts currently accrued by the company, net income would be adversely impacted and such impact could be material.

    ARROW ELECTRONICS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands except per share data) 
  (Unaudited) 

Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in "Accrued expenses" and "Other liabilities" in the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company has determined that there is no amount within the environmental liability range that is a better estimate than any other amount, and therefore has recorded the accruals at the minimum amount of the ranges.  
    
  As successor-in-interest to Wyle, the company is the beneficiary of various Wyle insurance policies that covered liabilities arising out of operations at Norco and Huntsville. To date, the company has recovered approximately   $37,000   from certain insurance carriers relating to environmental clean-up matters at the Norco site.  The company is considering the best way to pursue its potential claims against insurers regarding liabilities arising out of operations at Huntsville. The resolution of these matters will likely take several years. The company has not recorded a receivable for any potential future insurance recoveries related to the Norco and Huntsville environmental matters, as the realization of the claims for recovery are not deemed probable at this time. 
    
  The company believes the settlement amount together with potential recoveries from various insurance policies covering environmental remediation and related litigation will be sufficient to cover any potential future costs related to the Wyle acquisition; however, it is possible unexpected costs beyond those anticipated could occur. 
    
  Environmental Matters - Huntsville  
    
  In February 2015, the company and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management ("ADEM") finalized and executed a consent decree in connection with the Huntsville, Alabama site. Characterization of the extent of contaminated soil and groundwater continues at the site.  Under the direction of the ADEM, approximately   $5,000   was spent to date.  The pace of the ongoing remedial investigations, project management, and regulatory oversight is likely to increase somewhat and, though the complete scope of the activities is not yet known, the company currently estimates additional investigative and related expenditures at the site of approximately   $300   to   $750  .  The nature and scope of both feasibility studies and subsequent remediation at the site has not yet been determined, but assuming the outcome includes source control and certain other measures, the cost is estimated to be between   $3,000   and   $4,000  . 
    
  Despite the amount of work undertaken and planned to date, the company is unable to estimate any potential costs in addition to those discussed above because the complete scope of the work is not yet known, and, accordingly, the associated costs have yet to be determined. 
    
  Environmental Matters - Norco 
    
  In October 2003, the company entered into a consent decree with Wyle Laboratories and the California Department of Toxic Substance Control (the "DTSC") in connection with the Norco site.  In April 2005, a Remedial Investigation Work Plan was approved by DTSC that provided for site-wide characterization of known and potential environmental issues. Investigations performed in connection with this work plan and a series of subsequent technical memoranda continued until the filing of a final Remedial Investigation Report early in 2008. Work is under way pertaining to the remediation of contaminated groundwater at certain areas on the Norco site and of soil gas in a limited area immediately adjacent to the site.  In 2008, a hydraulic containment system was installed to capture and treat groundwater before it moves into the adjacent offsite area.  In September 2013, the DTSC approved the final Remedial Action Plan ("RAP") and work is currently progressing under the RAP.  The approval of the RAP includes the potential for additional remediation action after the five year review of the hydraulic containment system if the review finds that contaminants have not been sufficiently reduced in the offsite area. 
    
  Approximately   $53,000   was spent to date on remediation, project management, regulatory oversight, and investigative and feasibility study activities.  The company currently estimates that these activities will give rise to an additional   $22,300   to   $33,000  . Project management and regulatory oversight include costs incurred by project consultants for project management and costs billed by DTSC to provide regulatory oversight.   
    
  Despite the amount of work undertaken and planned to date, the company is unable to estimate any potential costs in addition to those discussed above because the complete scope of the work under the RAP is not yet known, and, accordingly, the associated costs have yet to be determined.

Tekelec Matter   
    
  In 2000, the company purchased Tekelec Europe SA ("Tekelec") from Tekelec Airtronic SA and certain other selling shareholders.  Subsequent to the closing of the acquisition, Tekelec received a product liability claim in the amount of    11,333  .  The product liability claim was the subject of a French legal proceeding started by the claimant in 2002, under which separate determinations were made as to whether the products that are subject to the claim were defective and the amount of damages sustained by the purchaser. The manufacturer of the products also participated in this proceeding. The claimant commenced legal proceedings against Tekelec and its insurers to recover damages in the amount of    3,742   and expenses of    312   plus interest. In May 2012, the French court ruled in favor of Tekelec and dismissed the plaintiff's claims. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals confirmed the French court's ruling.  Our counsel obtained a certificate of non-appeal in July 2016.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs are precluded from appealing or bringing a new action asserting the same claims. Based upon these developments, the company has released the contingency reserve related to Tekelec during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Antitrust Investigation 
  On January 21, 2014, the company received a Civil Investigative Demand in connection with an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") relating generally to the use of a database program (the  database program ) that has operated for more than ten years under the auspices of the Global Technology Distribution Council ("GTDC"), a trade group of which the company is a member. Under the database program, certain members of the GTDC who participate in the program provide sales data to a third party independent contractor chosen by the GTDC.  The data is aggregated by the third party and the aggregated data is made available to the program participants.  The company understands that other members participating in the database program have received similar Civil Investigative Demands. 
    
  In April 2014, the company responded to the Civil Investigative Demand. The Civil Investigative Demand merely sought information, and no proceedings have been instituted against any person.  The company continues to believe that there has not been any conduct by the company or its employees that would be actionable under the antitrust laws in connection with its participation in the database program.  At this time, it is not possible to predict the potential impact, if any, of the Civil Investigative Demand or whether any actions may be instituted by the FTC against any person. 
    
  Other 
    
  From time to time, in the normal course of business, the company may become liable with respect to other pending and threatened litigation, environmental, regulatory, labor, product, and tax matters. While such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, it is not currently anticipated that any such matters will materially impact the company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  Overview 
    
  Arrow Electronics, Inc. (the "company") is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company provides one of the broadest product offerings in the electronic components and enterprise computing solutions industries and a wide range of value-added services to help customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. The company has two business segments, the global components business segment and the global enterprise computing solutions business segment. The company provides electronic components to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to value-added resellers through its global ECS business segment. For the   first nine months   of   2016  , approximately   66%   of the company's sales were from the global components business segment and approximately   34%   of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment. 
    
  The company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and/or expand its geographic reach.   
    
  Executive Summary 
    
  Consolidated sales for the   third   quarter and   first nine months   of   2016     increase  d by   4.2%   and   5.2%  , respectively, compared with the year-earlier period. The   increase   for the   third   quarter of 2016 was driven by an   increase   in the global components business segment sales of   5.8%   and an   increase   in the global ECS business segment sales of   1.3%  . The   increase   for the   first nine months   of   2016   was driven by an   increase   in the global components business segment sales of   6.3%   and an   increase   in the global ECS business segment sales of   3.0%  . Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales   increase  d   3.5%   and   2.3%   for the   third   quarter and   first nine months   of   2016  , respectively, compared with the year-earlier periods. 
    
  Net income attributable to shareholders   increase  d to   $117.7 million   and   $358.2 million   in the   third   quarter and   first nine months   of   2016  , respectively, compared to   $109.2 million   and   $339.2 million   in the year-earlier periods. The following items impacted the comparability of the company's results: 
    
  Third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  : 

First nine months   of   2016   and   2015  : 

Excluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders for the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016     increase  d to   $143.1 million   and   $428.1 million  , respectively, compared with   $133.4 million   and   $410.1 million   in the year-earlier periods.  
    
  Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information 
    
  In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including: 

Sales, income, or expense items as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as "impact of changes in foreign currencies") and the impact of acquisitions by adjusting the company's operating results for businesses acquired, including the amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented (referred to as "impact of acquisitions");  
     
   24 

Operating income as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization and restructuring, integration, and other charges; and 
                
    Net income attributable to shareholders as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, loss on prepayment of debt, and gain on sale of investment. 
       
  Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Sales 
    
  Substantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.

Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.  Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.  It is the company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. If these funds were needed for the company's operations in the United States, it would be required to record and pay significant United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. Additionally, local government regulations may restrict the company's ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances.  The company currently does not expect such regulations and restrictions to impact its ability to make acquisitions or to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.

  The company has a   $1.50 billion   revolving credit facility, maturing in December 2018.  This facility may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness and acquisitions, and as support for the company's  commercial paper program, as applicable.  Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (  1.30%   at   October 1, 2016  ), which is based on the company's credit ratings, or an effective interest rate of   1.72%   at   October 1, 2016  . The facility fee is   .20%  .  There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at October 1, 2016.

The company has an asset securitization program collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of its subsidiaries. In September 2016, the company amended its asset securitization program and, among other things, increased its borrowing capacity from   $900.0 million   to   $910.0 million   and extended its term to mature in September 2019. The asset securitization program is conducted through Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The asset securitization program does not qualify for true sale treatment.  Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (  .40%   at   October 1, 2016  ), which is based on the company's credit ratings, or an effective interest rate of   1.07%   at    October 1, 2016  .  The facility fee is   .40%  . The company had   $467.0 million   and   $75.0 million   in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  During the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was   $613.6 million   and   $467.3 million  , respectively.  
    
  Both the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels.  The company was in compliance with all covenants as of   October 1, 2016   and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future. 
    
  The company has a   $100.0 million   uncommitted line of credit. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . During the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , the average daily balance outstanding under the uncommitted line of credit was   $28.0 million   and   $16.5 million  , respectively.  
    
  In the normal course of business, certain of the company s subsidiaries have agreements to sell, without recourse, selected trade receivables to financial institutions. The company does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables, and, accordingly, they are accounted for as sales of the related receivables and the receivables are removed from the company s consolidated balance sheets. Financing costs related to these transactions were not material and are included in "Interest and other financing expense, net" in the company s consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  The company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2015 registering debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, and warrants of Arrow Electronics, Inc. that may be issued by the company from time to time. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by the company for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
    
  Management believes that the company's current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and asset securitization program, its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows, and the company's access to capital markets are sufficient to meet its projected cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary. 
    
  Contractual Obligations

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis.  The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  There were no significant changes during the   first nine months   of   2016   to the items disclosed as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards    
  See Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the anticipated dates of adoption and the effects on the company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
    
  Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report includes forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: industry conditions, the company's implementation of its new enterprise resource planning system, changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand, competition, other vagaries in the global components and global ECS markets, changes in relationships with key suppliers, increased profit margin pressure, the effects of additional actions taken to become more efficient or lower costs, risks related to the integration of acquired businesses, changes in legal and regulatory matters, and the company s ability to generate additional cash flow.  Forward-looking statements are those statements which are not statements of historical fact.  These forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "may," "will," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and similar expressions.  Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  There were no material changes in market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates from the information provided in Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the company's Annual Report on Form      10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  The company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures as of October 1, 2016 (the "Evaluation"). Based upon the Evaluation, the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, because of a material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting, the company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.   This material weakness was previously disclosed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and continues to exist as of October 1, 2016. 
    
  Notwithstanding the identified material weakness described below, management does not believe that these deficiencies had an adverse effect on the company s reported operating results or financial condition and management has determined that the financial statements and other information included in this report and other periodic filings present fairly in all material respects the company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). 
    
  Management determined that the company s internal controls did not operate effectively to prevent or timely detect unauthorized cash disbursements.  Specifically, although management believes internal controls were adequate to timely detect unauthorized cash disbursements so as to prevent or detect a material misstatement of the company s financial statements, these controls were not adequate to safeguard the company s cash assets from unauthorized transfers resulting from the failure of certain members of the finance organization to exercise appropriate skepticism and oversight for disbursement of company-owned funds. This material weakness in the company s controls resulted in the inability to prevent and timely detect the fraud loss discussed in Note I of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Remediation of the Material Weakness 
    
  Management has initiated a remediation plan and has completed the following actions: 

enhanced approval requirements for electronic disbursements; 
                
    increased centralization and levels of review for the processing of disbursements; 
                
    implemented limits on the amount of cash available for disbursement; 
                
    increased internal communications to improve security awareness and to emphasize the importance of exercising   professional skepticism; 
                
    established communications protocols for attempted fraudulent disbursements; and 
                
    replaced individuals responsible for the unauthorized use of the company s assets. 
       
  Management began testing its remedial controls during the second quarter of 2016.    After the applicable remedial controls operate effectively for a sufficient period of time, management believes that it will be able to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  Other than the changes associated with the remediation efforts described above, there was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

  ARTICLE VI  PURCHASES AND SETTLEMENTS 
  Section 1.  .    Transfer of Affected Assets; Intended Characterization 
  .      (a)     Sale of Asset Interest  .  In consideration of the payment by the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Funding Agents on behalf of the Conduit Investors and/or the Alternate Investors) of the amount of the initial Net Investment on the Closing Date and the Administrative Agent s agreement (on behalf of the Funding Agents on behalf of the Conduit Investors or the Alternate Investors) to make payments to the SPV from time to time in accordance with   Section 2.2  , effective upon the SPV s receipt of payment for such initial Net Investment on the Closing Date, the SPV hereby sells, conveys, transfers and assigns to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Funding Agents on behalf of the Conduit Investors or the Alternate Investors, as applicable, all of the SPV s right, title and interest in, to and under (i) all Receivables existing on the Closing Date or thereafter arising or acquired by the SPV from time to time prior to the Final Payout Date and (ii) all other Affected Assets, whether existing on the Closing Date or thereafter arising at any time.  The Alternate Investors  several obligations to make purchases from the SPV hereunder shall terminate on the Termination Date. For purposes of the laws of the Province of Quebec, all of the Receivables and Affected Assets conveyed by Arrow to SPV under Section 2.1(a) of the First Tier Agreement and then conveyed by SPV to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Funding Agents (on behalf of the Conduit Investors or the Alternate Investors, as applicable), under this Section 2.1(a) include the universality of all present and future claims comprising all present and future Quebec Receivables and all Quebec Related Security with respect thereto and all proceeds of the foregoing, in each case, whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired (collectively, the    Quebec Assets   ). 
  (a)  Purchase of Asset Interest  .  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Funding Agents (on behalf of their related Conduit Investors and/or the Related Alternate Investors as applicable) hereby purchases and accepts from the SPV an undivided percentage ownership interest in the Receivables and all other Affected Assets sold, assigned and transferred pursuant to   subsection (a)  .  The Funding Agents  right, title and interest in and to the Receivables and all other Affected Assets hereunder is herein called the    Asset Interest   .  The Funding Agents shall  

hold the Asset Interest on behalf of their related Conduit Investors and Related Alternate Investors in accordance with the related Investor Interest, from time to time. To the extent a Funding Agent holds the Asset Interest on behalf of the Related Alternate Investors, such Funding Agent shall hold the Alternate Investor Percentage of the Asset Interest on behalf of such Alternate Investors   pro     rata   in accordance with their respective outstanding portions of the Net Investment funded by them. 
  (b)  Obligations Not Assumed  .  The foregoing sale, assignment and transfer does not constitute and is not intended to result in the creation, or an assumption by any Funding Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Investor, of any obligation of the SPV, any Originator, or any other Person under or in connection with the Receivables or any other Affected Asset, all of which shall remain the obligations and liabilities of the SPV and the applicable Originator. 
  (c)  Intended Characterization; Grant of Security Interest  .   
  (i)        The SPV, each Funding Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Investors intend that the sale, assignment and transfer of the Affected Assets to the Funding Agent (on behalf of their related Conduit Investors and/or the Related Alternate Investors as applicable) hereunder shall be treated as a sale for all purposes, other than U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.  If notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the sale, assignment and transfer of the Affected Assets to the Funding Agents shall be characterized as a secured loan and not a sale for all purposes (other than U.S. federal and state income tax purposes) or any such sale shall for any reason be ineffective or unenforceable (any of the foregoing being a    Recharacterization   ) (as to which the foregoing shall constitute indebtedness of the SPV secured by the Affected Assets), such sale, assignment and transfer of the Affected Assets shall be treated as the grant of, and the SPV hereby does grant, a security interest in the Affected Assets to secure the payment and performance of the SPV s obligations for the benefit of the Funding Agents (on behalf of the related Conduit Investors and/or the Related Alternate Investors as applicable) hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents or as may be determined in connection therewith by applicable Law.      In the case of any Recharacterization, the SPV represents and warrants that each remittance of Collections to the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent or any Purchaser Group hereunder will have been (i) in payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the SPV and (ii) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the SPV. 
    
  (i)  The parties hereto acknowledge that Arrow and the SPV intend that the sale, assignment and transfer of the Receivables and Related Security to the SPV under the First Tier Agreement shall be treated as a sale for all purposes, and each of the parties hereto is relying on such treatment.  If, notwithstanding the intent of Arrow and the SPV, the sale, assignment and transfer of the Receivables and Related Security under the First Tier Agreement shall for any reason be characterized as a secured loan and not a sale or such sale shall for any reason be ineffective or unenforceable, each of Arrow and the SPV represents and warrants as to itself that each remittance of Collections by Arrow to the SPV under the First Tier Agreement will have been (i) in payment of a debt incurred by Arrow in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of Arrow and the SPV and (ii) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of Arrow and the SPV. 
  (ii)        Each of the parties hereto further expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Commitments of the Alternate Investors hereunder, regardless of the intended true sale nature of the overall transaction, are financial accommodations (within the meaning of Section 365(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code) to or for the benefit of the SPV.

Each such payment is herein called an    Investment   . 
  (b)  Reinvestments  .  On each Business Day during the Reinvestment Period, the Master Servicer, on behalf of the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Funding Agents for the benefit of the Conduit Investors and/or the Alternate Investors as applicable), shall pay to the SPV, out of Collections of Receivables, the amount available for Reinvestment in accordance with   Section 2.12(a)(iii)  .  Each such payment is hereinafter called a    Reinvestment   .  All Reinvestments with respect to the Conduit Investor Percentage and the Alternate Investor Percentage of the Asset Interest shall be made ratably on behalf of the Conduit Investors and Alternate Investors, as applicable,   pro     rata   in accordance with their respective outstanding portions of the Alternate Investor Percentage and Conduit Investor Percentage, as applicable, of the Net Investment funded by them.

Any amount which the Administrative Agent (whether on behalf of the Funding Agents for the benefit of the Conduit Investors or the Alternate Investors, if applicable) does not pay pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not constitute a claim (as defined in   101 of the Bankruptcy Code) against or corporate obligation of the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent or any Investor for any such insufficiency unless and until such amount becomes available for distribution to the SPV under   Section 2.12  .

  (b)  Notice  .

Each such Investment Request shall specify (i) the desired amount of such Investment (which shall be at least $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or, to the extent that the then available unused portion of the Maximum Net Investment is less than such amount, such lesser amount equal to such available unused portion of the Maximum Net Investment), including the aggregate Pro Rata Shares per Purchaser Group of such Investment, (ii) the Investment Date which shall be a Permitted Investment Date and (iii) the desired Rate Period(s) and allocations of such Investment thereto as required by Section 2.4.

If more than one Conduit Investor in any Purchaser Group accepts an Investment Request, the portion of such Investment Request to be funded by each Conduit Investor in such Purchaser Group shall be determined by the Related Funding Agent in its sole discretion. 
  (ii)  Each Investment Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the SPV, and the SPV shall indemnify each Investor against any loss or expense incurred by such Investor, either directly or indirectly (including, in the case of a Conduit Investor, through a Program Support Agreement) as a result of any failure by the SPV to complete such Investment, including any loss (including loss of profit) or expense incurred by a Funding Agent or any Investor, either directly or indirectly (including, in the case of a Conduit Investor, pursuant to a Program Support Agreement) by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds acquired by such Investor (or the applicable Program Support Provider(s)) (including funds obtained by issuing commercial paper or promissory notes or obtaining deposits or loans from third parties) in order to fund such Investment. 

(d)  Alternate Investor s Commitment  .  Subject to   Section 2.2(b)   concerning Reinvestments, at no time will a Conduit Investor have any obligation to fund an Investment or Reinvestment.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this   Section 2.3(c)   or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, no Alternate Investor shall be obligated to provide any Funding Agent or the SPV with funds in connection with an Investment in an amount that would result in the portion of the Net Investment then funded by it exceeding its Allocable Portion of Maximum Net Investment then in effect (  minus   the unrecovered principal amount of such Alternate Investor s investment in the Asset Interest pursuant to the Program Support Agreement to which it is a party).  The obligation of each Alternate Investor to remit its Special Pro Rata Share of any such Investment shall be several from that of each other Alternate Investor, and the failure of any Alternate Investor to so make such amount available to the Related Funding Agent shall not relieve any other Alternate Investor of its obligation hereunder.

  (f)  Administrative Agent May Advance Funds  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Funding Agent that any related Investor will not make its share of any Investment available on the applicable Investment Date therefor, the Administrative Agent may (but shall have no obligation to) make any such Investor s share of any such Investment available to the SPV in anticipation of the receipt by the Administrative Agent of such amount from the applicable Investor.  To the extent any such Investor or Funding Agent on behalf of such Investor fails to remit any such amount to the Administrative Agent after any such advance by the Administrative Agent on such Investment Date, such Investor, on the one hand, and the SPV, on the other hand, shall be required to pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for its own account, together with interest thereon at a   per     annum   rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate, in the case of such Investor, or the Base Rate, in the case of the SPV, to the Administrative Agent upon its demand therefor (  provided   that a Conduit Investor shall have no obligation to pay such interest amounts except to the extent that it shall have sufficient funds to pay the face amount of its Commercial Paper in full).  Until such amount shall be repaid, such amount shall be deemed to be Net Investment paid by the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be the owner of an interest in the Asset Interest hereunder to the extent of such Investment.  Upon the payment of such amount to the Administrative Agent (i) by the SPV, the amount of the aggregate Net Investment shall be reduced by such amount or (ii) by such Investor, such payment shall constitute such Investor s payment of its share of the applicable Investment.

Each of the SPV, the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents and the Investors hereby appoints as its agent the Master Servicer, from time to time designated pursuant to this   Section 7.1  , to enforce its respective rights and interests in and under the Affected Assets. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the SPV and Arrow (to the extent not then acting as Master Servicer hereunder) hereby grants to any Master Servicer appointed hereunder an irrevocable power of attorney to take any  

and all steps in the SPV s and/or Arrow s name and on behalf of the SPV or Arrow as necessary or desirable, in the reasonable determination of the Master Servicer, to collect all amounts due under any and all Receivables, including endorsing the SPV s and/or Arrow s name on checks and other instruments representing Collections and enforcing such Receivables and the related Contracts and to take all such other actions set forth in this   Article VII  .  Until the Administrative Agent gives notice to Arrow (in accordance with this   Section 7.1  ) of the designation of a new Master Servicer, Arrow is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof.  Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event or a Potential Termination Event (which Potential Termination Event is not capable of being cured), the Administrative Agent may (with the consent of the Majority Investors), and upon the direction of the Majority Investors shall, designate as Master Servicer any Person (including itself) to succeed Arrow or any successor Master Servicer, on the condition in each case that any such Person so designated shall agree to perform the duties and obligations of the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof. 
  (b)  Upon the designation of a successor Master Servicer as set forth above, Arrow agrees that it will terminate its activities as Master Servicer hereunder in a manner which the Administrative Agent determines will facilitate the transition of the performance of such activities to the new Master Servicer, and Arrow shall cooperate with and assist such new Master Servicer.  Such cooperation shall include access to and transfer of records and use by the new Master Servicer of all records, licenses, hardware or software necessary or reasonably desirable to collect the Receivables and the Related Security. 
  (c)  Arrow acknowledges that each of the SPV, the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents and the Investors have relied on Arrow s agreement to act as Master Servicer hereunder in making their decision to execute and deliver this Agreement.  Accordingly, Arrow agrees that it will not voluntarily resign as Master Servicer. 
  (d)  The Master Servicer may delegate its duties and obligations hereunder to any subservicer (each, a    Sub-Servicer    provided that, in each such delegation, (i) such Sub-Servicer shall agree in writing to perform the duties and obligations of the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof, (ii) the Master Servicer shall remain primarily liable to the SPV, the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents and the Investors for the performance of the duties and obligations so delegated, (iii) the SPV, the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents, the Investors and each Originator shall have the right to look solely to the Master Servicer for performance and (iv) the terms of any agreement with any Sub-Servicer shall provide that the Administrative Agent may terminate such agreement upon the termination of the Master Servicer hereunder by giving notice of its desire to terminate such agreement to the Master Servicer (and the Master Servicer shall provide appropriate notice to such Sub-Servicer).   
  (e)  Arrow hereby irrevocably agrees that if at any time it shall cease to be the Master Servicer hereunder, it shall act (if the then current Master Servicer so requests) as the data-processing agent of the Master Servicer and, in such capacity, Arrow shall conduct, for a reasonable fee as may be agreed between Arrow and the Administrative Agent, the data-processing functions of the administration of the Receivables and the Collections thereon in substantially the same way that Arrow conducted such data-processing functions while it acted as the Master Servicer.  
  Section 2.  .    Duties of Master Servicer 
  .   
  (a)  The Master Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such action as may be necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with this Agreement and all applicable Law, with reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.  The Master Servicer shall set aside (and, if applicable, segregate) and hold in trust for the account of the SPV, the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents and the Investors the amount of the Collections to which each is entitled in accordance with   Article II  .  So long as no Termination Event or Potential Termination Event shall have occurred and is continuing, the Master Servicer may, in accordance with  

the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable (but not beyond ten (10) days) and extend the maturity or adjust the Unpaid Balance of any Defaulted Receivable as the Master Servicer may determine to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof;   provided  ,   however  , that (i) such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the SPV, the Investors, the Funding Agents or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and (ii) if a Termination Event or Potential Termination Event has occurred and Arrow is still acting as Master Servicer, Arrow may make such extension or adjustment only upon the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent.  The SPV shall deliver to the Master Servicer and the Master Servicer shall hold in trust for the SPV and the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Funding Agents on behalf of the Investors, in accordance with their respective interests, all Records which evidence or relate to any Affected Asset.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Administrative Agent shall have the right in its reasonable discretion to direct the Master Servicer (whether Arrow, any other Originator or any other Person is the Master Servicer) to commence or settle any legal action to enforce collection of any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Affected Asset   provided  ,   however  , that upon the occurrence of a Termination Event or Potential Termination Event (which Potential Termination Event is not capable of being cured), the Administrative Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right to so direct the Master Servicer.  The Master Servicer shall not make the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent or any Investor a party to any litigation without the prior written consent of such Person. At any time when a Termination Event or Potential Termination Event (which Potential Termination Event is not capable of being cured) exists, the Administrative Agent may notify any Obligor of its interest in the Receivables and the other Affected Assets.  
  (b)  The Master Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following receipt thereof, turn over to the SPV all collections from any Person of indebtedness of such Person which are not on account of a Receivable.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Article VII  , the Master Servicer, if not the SPV, Arrow, any Affiliate of the SPV, or Arrow, shall have no obligation to collect, enforce or take any other action described in this   Article VII   with respect to any indebtedness that is not included in the Asset Interest other than to deliver to the SPV the Collections and documents with respect to any such indebtedness as described above in this   Section 7.2(b)  . 
  (c)  The Funding Agents may engage twice during any twelve-month period, commencing October 27, 2010, at the Master Servicer s sole expense, the services of a specialty audit firm or a firm of independent public accountants that is acceptable to the Funding Agents, to furnish an agreed-upon procedures report to the Funding Agents substantially in compliance with the procedures set forth in   Schedule V   or any additional procedures as the Funding Agents reasonably deem appropriate; provided that, if the senior unsecured debt of Arrow is rated below BBB- or Baa3 by S P or Moody s, respectively, the Funding Agents retain the right to request such reports on a reasonable, more frequent basis, at the Master Servicer s sole expense.  An audit report of such firm shall be delivered to the Funding Agents not later than September 30   th    of each calendar year and at such other times as may be specified by the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that for the calendar year 2016 the audit report shall be delivered no later than January 31, 2017. 
  (d)  Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to an Originator shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor, required by contract or law or clearly indicated by facts or circumstances (including by way of example an equivalence of a payment and the amount of a particular invoice) after due investigation in accordance with such Originator s Credit and Collection Policy, and unless otherwise instructed by the Administrative Agent, upon the occurrence of a Termination Date, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other indebtedness of such Obligor.  
  Section 3.  .    Blocked Account Arrangements 

.  Prior to the initial Investment hereunder, the SPV, Arrow and each other Originator shall enter into Blocked Account Agreements with all of the Blocked Account Banks, and deliver original counterparts thereof to the Administrative Agent. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event or a Potential Termination Event (which Potential Termination Event is not capable of being cured), the Administrative Agent may at any time thereafter give notice to each Blocked Account Bank that the Administrative Agent is exercising its rights under the Blocked Account Agreements to do any or all of the following: (i) to have the exclusive ownership and control of the Blocked Account Accounts transferred to the Administrative Agent and to exercise exclusive dominion and control over the funds deposited therein, (ii) to have the proceeds that are sent to the respective Blocked Accounts be redirected pursuant to its instructions rather than deposited in the applicable Blocked Account, and (iii) to take any or all other actions permitted under the applicable Blocked Account Agreement.  Arrow hereby agrees that if the Administrative Agent, at any time, takes any action set forth in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control of the proceeds (including Collections) of all Receivables and Arrow hereby further agrees to take any other action that the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to transfer such control.  Any proceeds of Receivables received by Arrow, as Master Servicer or otherwise, thereafter shall be sent immediately to the Administrative Agent.  The parties hereto hereby acknowledge that if at any time the Administrative Agent takes control of any Blocked Account, the Administrative Agent shall not have any rights to the funds therein in excess of the unpaid amounts due to SPV, the Administrative Agent and the Investors or any other Person hereunder and the Administrative Agent shall distribute or cause to be distributed such funds in accordance with   Section 7.2(b)   (including the proviso thereto) and   Article II   (in each case as if such funds were held by the Master Servicer thereunder);   provided  ,   however  , that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to remit any such funds to the SPV, Arrow or any other Person unless and until the Administrative Agent has received from such Person evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the Originator or such Person is entitled to such funds hereunder and under applicable Law.

(b)  The SPV and Arrow hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, and irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution and with full authority in the place and stead of the SPV or Arrow, as applicable, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to take any and all steps in the name of the SPV or Arrow, as applicable, and on behalf of the SPV or Arrow, as applicable, necessary or desirable, in the determination of the Administrative Agent, to collect any and all amounts or portions thereof due under any and all Receivables or Related Security, including endorsing the name of Arrow on checks and other instruments representing Collections and enforcing such Receivables, Related Security and the related Contracts.

The amounts due and payable to an Indemnified Party under this Section shall be considered Aggregate Unpaids. 
  (b)  The applicable Funding Agent shall promptly notify the SPV and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle an Indemnified Party to compensation pursuant to this   Section 9.2  ;   provided   that no failure to give or any  

delay in giving such notice shall affect the Indemnified Party s right to receive such compensation.  A notice by such Funding Agent or the applicable Indemnified Party claiming compensation under this   Section 9.2   and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Funding Agent or any applicable Indemnified Party may use any reasonable averaging and attributing methods. 
  (c)  Anything in this   Section 9.2   to the contrary notwithstanding, if any Conduit Investor enters into agreements for the acquisition of interests in receivables from one or more Other SPVs, such Conduit Investor shall allocate the liability for any amounts under this   Section 9.2   which are in connection with a Program Support Agreement or the credit or liquidity support provided by a Program Support Provider (   Additional Costs   ) to the SPV and each Other SPV;   provided  ,   however  , that if such Additional Costs are attributable to the SPV, any Originator or the Master Servicer and not attributable to any Other SPV, the SPV shall be solely liable for such Additional Costs or if such Additional Costs are attributable to Other SPVs and not attributable to the SPV, any Originator or the Master Servicer, such Other SPVs shall be solely liable for such Additional Costs.

  (b)  In the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment made by the payor hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes, then such payor shall:  
  (i)  pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted; 
  (ii)  promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority; and 
  (iii)  pay to the recipient such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the recipient will equal the full amount such recipient would have received had no such withholding or deduction of Taxes, other than Excluded Taxes been required. 
  (c)  If any Taxes are directly asserted against any recipient with respect to any payment received by such recipient hereunder, the recipient may pay such Taxes and the payor will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as shall be necessary in order that the net amount received by the recipient after the payment of such Taxes other than Excluded Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such recipient would have received had such Taxes other than Excluded Taxes not been asserted.   
  (d)  If the payor fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the recipient the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the payor shall indemnify the recipient for any incremental Taxes, interest, or penalties that may become payable by any recipient as a result of any such failure.  
  (e)  Each Investor that is not a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(A)(30) of the Code shall on the Closing Date (or if later, the date on which such person first becomes an Investor hereunder by assignment or otherwise) provide to the Administrative Agent to be forwarded to the relevant payor either (i) a duly completed IRS Form W-8ECI, (ii) a duly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, in each case entitling such Investor to a complete exemption from  

withholding on payments and distributions hereunder (which in the case of a form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, is based on its entitlement to exemption under an applicable income tax treaty)  . 
  (f)  If a payment made to an Investor under any Transaction Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Investor were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Investor shall deliver to Arrow and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Arrow or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Arrow or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Arrow and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Investor has complied with such Investor s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (f),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
  (g)  In addition to the obligations under Section 9.3(e), any Indemnified Party that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the applicable payor is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to any payments made to it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the applicable payor, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or as otherwise reasonably requested by the applicable payor or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Indemnified Party, if requested by the applicable payor or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the applicable payor or Administrative Agent as will enable the applicable payor to determine whether or not such Indemnified Party is subject to withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3(g), but without limiting any Indemnified Party s obligations under Section 9.3(e), no Indemnified Party shall be required to deliver any documentation that it is not legally eligible to deliver or that would, in the reasonable judgement of such Indemnified Party, subject such Indemnified Party to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Indemnified Party.  
  Section 4.  .    Other Costs and Expenses; Breakage Costs 
  .      (a) The SPV agrees, upon receipt of a written invoice, to pay or cause to be paid, and to save the Investors, the Funding Agents and the Administrative Agent harmless against liability for the payment of, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys , accountants , rating agencies , and other third parties  fees and expenses, any filing fees and expenses incurred by officers or employees of any Investor and/or the Administrative Agent) or intangible, documentary or recording taxes incurred by or on behalf of the any Investor, any Funding Agent or the Administrative Agent (i) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and any documents or instruments delivered pursuant hereto and thereto and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the perfection or protection of the Asset Interest) (which payment of attorneys  fees and expenses, in the case of this clause (i) shall be limited to Dechert LLP, Sidley Austin LLP or any other attorneys  fees and expenses of an attorney approved in advance by the Master Servicer) and (ii) from time to time (A) relating to any amendments, waivers or consents under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, (B) arising in connection with any Investor s, any Funding Agent s or the Administrative Agent s enforcement or preservation of rights (including the perfection and protection of the Asset Interest under this Agreement), or (C) arising in connection with any dispute, disagreement, litigation or preparation for litigation involving this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents (all of such amounts, collectively,    Transaction Costs   ). 

(a)  The SPV shall pay the Administrative Agent for the account of each Investor, as applicable, on demand, such amount or amounts as shall compensate such Investor for any loss (including loss of profit), cost or expense incurred by it (as reasonably determined by the applicable Funding Agent) as a result of any reduction of any Portion of Investment of such Investor other than on the last day of the related Rate Period (determined without regard for clause (ii) of paragraph (a) of the definition thereof) funding such Portion of Investment of such Investor, such compensation to be (i) limited to an amount equal to any loss or expense suffered by the Investors during the period from the date of receipt of such repayment to (but excluding) the maturity date of such Commercial Paper (or other financing source) and (ii) net of the income, if any, received by the recipient of such reductions from investing the proceeds of such reductions of such Portion of Investment.

  Section 2.4   of the Agreement shall be read in its entirety as follows: 
  SECTION 2.4    Determination of Yield and Rate Periods 
  (c)        Portions of Investment  .  The Net Investment shall be allocated to tranches (each a    Portion of Investment   ) having Rate Periods and accruing Yield at the Rate Types specified and determined in accordance with this   Section 2.4  .  At any time, each Portion of Investment shall have only one Rate Period and one Rate Type.  In addition, at any time when the Net Investment is not divided into more than one portion,  Portion of Investment  means 100% of the Net Investment. 
  (d)        Asset Interest held on behalf of Conduit Investors  .  (i) At all times on and after the Closing Date, but prior to the Termination Date, solely with respect to any Portion of Investment held on behalf of each Match Funding Conduit Investor at any time when such Conduit Investor funds such Portion of Investment through the issuance of Commercial Paper, the SPV may, subject to such Conduit Investor s approval and the limitations described below, request Rate Periods and allocate a Portion of Investment to each selected Rate Period, so that the aggregate Portions of Investment allocated to outstanding Rate Periods at all times shall equal the portion of the Net Investment held on behalf of such Conduit Investors.  The SPV shall give the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agent with respect to each Match Funding Conduit Investor irrevocable notice by telephone or by fax of each requested Rate Period at least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Investment Date or the expiration of any then existing Rate Period, as applicable;   provided  ,   however  , that each Match Funding Conduit Investor may select, in its sole discretion, any such Rate Period if (x) the SPV fails to provide such notice on a timely basis or (y) the Funding Agent with respect to such Match Funding Conduit Investor determines, in its sole discretion, that the Rate Period requested by the SPV is unavailable or for any reason commercially undesirable to such Investor;   provided  ,   further  , that the SPV shall not select any Rate Period with respect to a Portion of Investment which Rate Period would have a maturity date after a Special Termination Date with respect to the related Conduit Investor if such Special Termination Date is known at the time of such selection.  Each Match Funding Conduit Investor confirms that it is its intention prior to the date it ceases purchasing new Investments or Reinvestments to allocate all or substantially all of the portion of the Net Investment held on its behalf to one or more Rate Periods with respect to which the Yield applicable thereto is calculated by reference to the CP Rate;   provided   that each Match Funding Conduit Investor may determine, from time to time, in its sole discretion, that funding such Net Investment by means of one or more such Rate Periods is not possible or is not desirable for any reason.     Each Rate Period applicable to any Portion of Investment funded by a Match Funding Conduit Investor pursuant to a Program Support Agreement shall be a period, selected by the applicable Funding Agent (which for the  

initial Rate Period shall not exceed five (5) Business Days, and Yield with respect thereto shall be calculated by reference to the Alternate Rate.  
  (i)  From time to time, for purposes of determining the Rate Periods applicable to the different portions of the Net Investment and of calculating Yield with respect thereto, the applicable Funding Agent, in consultation with the SPV and the Administrative Agent as described in   Section 2.4(b)(i)   above, shall allocate each Portion of Investment.  From time to time the Administrative Agent shall notify the Master Servicer of the number of Portions of Investment and the Rate Type of each Portion of Investment. 
  (e)        Asset Interest held on behalf of Alternate Investors  .  Unless an Alternate Investor specifies otherwise, the initial Rate Period applicable to any Portion of Investment funded by the Alternate Investors (or any of them), shall be a period of not greater than five (5) Business Days and Yield with respect thereto shall be calculated by reference to the Alternate Rate.  Thereafter, unless an Alternate Investor specifies otherwise, with respect to such Portion of Investment, and with respect to any other Portion of Investment held on behalf of the Alternate Investors (or any of them), the Rate Period applicable thereto shall be determined by the SPV (or, if on or after the Termination Date, by the Administrative Agent and applicable Funding Agent) and Yield with respect thereto shall be calculated by reference to the Alternate Rate.  The SPV shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice by telephone of the new requested Rate Period at least three (3) Business Days prior to the expiration of any then existing Rate Period; and  
  (f)        Rate Definitions  .  As used in this   Section 2.4  , the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined).    
     Alternate Rate    means, for any Rate Period for any Portion of Investment, an interest rate   per     annum   equal to the sum of the Offshore Rate and the Applicable Margin for such Rate Period;   provided  ,   however  , that, in the case of: 
  (i)        with respect to any Portion of the Investment funded by a Match Funding Conduit Investor, any Rate Period of one to (and including) 14 days; or

  (iii)        the initial Rate Period applicable to any Portion of Investment funded by (a) an Alternate Investor or (b) a Program Support Provider under a Program Support Agreement; or 
  (iv)        any Rate Period relating to a Portion of Investment which is less than $1,000,000,  
  the    Alternate Rate    for each such Rate Period shall be an interest rate   per     annum   equal to the Base Rate in effect on each day of such Rate Period plus the Applicable Margin.  The    Alternate Rate    for any date on or after the declaration or automatic occurrence of the Termination Date pursuant to   Section 8.2   or clause (e) of the definition of  Termination Date  shall be an interest rate equal to 2.50%   per     annum   above the Base Rate in effect on such day  . 
       Applicable Margin    means, on any date, the rate per annum determined based upon the Rating in effect on such date by both S P and Moody s set forth under the relevant column heading below opposite such Rating: 

;   provided   that, in the event that the Ratings of S P and Moody s do not coincide, (i) the Applicable Margin set forth above opposite the lower of such Ratings will apply if the Ratings differ by only one level, (ii) the Applicable Margin consistent with the Rating one level above the lower Rating will apply if the ratings differ by two or more levels, and (iii), if there are no Ratings in effect, the Applicable Margin will be based on the Rating of less than BB+/Ba1. 
    
       Base Rate    means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate for such day,   plus   1.50% and (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its  prime rate .  The  prime rate  is a rate set by the Administrative Agent based upon various factors including the Administrative Agent s costs and desired return, general economic conditions and other factors, and is used as a reference point for pricing some loans, which may be priced at, above, or below such announced rate.  Any change in the prime rate announced by the Administrative Agent shall take effect at the opening of business on the day specified in the public announcement of such change. 
     CP Rate    means, for any Rate Period for any Portion of Investment (a) funded by a Pooled Funding Conduit Investor, the   per     annum   rate equivalent to the weighted average cost (as determined by the related Funding Agent and which shall include commissions of dealers and placement agents (without duplication of any Fees for such purposes pursuant to Section 2.5)), incremental carrying costs incurred with respect to Commercial Paper maturing on dates other than those on which corresponding funds are received by the Conduit Investor (and not otherwise allocable to other investments or assets of such Conduit Investor), other borrowings by the Conduit Investor (other than under any Program Support Agreement) and any other costs associated with the issuance of Commercial Paper) of or related to the issuance of Commercial Paper that are allocated, in whole or in part, by the Conduit Investor or its Funding Agent to fund or maintain such Portion of Investment (and which may be also allocated in part to the funding of other assets of the Conduit Investor), and (b) funded by a Match Funding Conduit Investor for any Rate Period (which shall be a period selected in accordance with Section 2.4(b)) for any Portion of Investment funded by the Conduit Investor issuing Commercial Paper, the rate equivalent to the rate (or if more than one rate, the weighted average of the rates) at which Commercial Paper having a term equal to such Rate Period may be sold by any placement agent or commercial paper dealer selected by the Conduit Investor (which rate shall include commissions of dealers and placement agents and incremental carrying costs incurred with respect to (i) Commercial Paper maturities and/or dealer fees that may become due and payable on dates other than those on which corresponding funds are received by such Conduit Investor, and (ii) other borrowings by such Conduit Investor with respect to the issuance of Commercial Paper),   provided  ,   however  , that if the rate (or rates) as agreed between any such placement agent or dealer and the Conduit Investor is a discount rate, then the rate

     Verify the accuracy of the monthly reports for Month#1 and Month#2.  

Determine whether the items shown on the monthly report complies with the terms of the TAA, such as proper reporting of the rollforward and aging and proper calculation of ineligibles. 

Verify the accuracy of the large obligor (concentrations) and payable and contra information provided to the corporate location for possible inclusion in the consolidated monthly report. 

Trace line items to supporting documentation (and to the general ledger, if applicable), including tracing cash back to the bank statements.  Recalculate line items. 

2. 
    Monthly Report - Consolidated / Consolidating 
     Verify the accuracy of the monthly report for Month#1 and Month#2. 

Determine whether the rollforward, aging, and eligible receivables are accurately stated by tracing line items for the various originators to the consolidating schedule.   

Recalculate the consolidated ratios in accordance with the definitions in the TAA. 

Review supporting documentation for determining the obligor concentrations.  Ascertain that the concentration information was accurately included in the consolidating and consolidated concentration information. 

Prepare a chart of the line items analyzed and a comparison of the company prepared figures to those you recomputed. Briefly describe the nature of the supporting documentation for each line item. 

3. 
    Obligor Concentration 
     Ask management to provide you with an   aged   listing of the 10     largest obligors (aggregating exposure among affiliated obligors) at month end Month#2.  Verify the accuracy of this information on a sample basis by tracing amounts to the summary or detailed aged receivable trial balance.  Include the payment terms granted to each obligor in your exhibit.  Attach this listing as an exhibit to your report.  

For Month#1 and Month#2, obtain the reconciliation of the aging per monthly report to the aged trial balance   the general ledger.  Describe the nature of any significant reconciling items.  Note the timeliness of completion.  Summarize each of the reconciliations and include the details for each significant reconciling item in the report.   
    
  Include a description of the aging methodology in your report (i.e. DPI).  Describe how unapplied amounts and/or partial payments affect an account s aging status.   
    
  Select 10 invoices from among the various aging categories at month end Month#2, and:  

Determine if the accounts are being properly aged in accordance with the terms and methodology.  Note any accounts that may be aged in a non conforming manner.  

Determine whether the terms of payment on the sale receipt would make the sales receipt ineligible for purchase.  If so, determine if the company is properly excluding such invoices from sale to the conduits. 

Obtain the related documentation pertaining to proof of delivery.  Determine that the invoices were issued either coincident with or subsequent to the purchase of goods.   

Prepare a listing of the accounts analyzed with an indication of the aging accuracy, the payment terms as stated on the face of the invoice, which entity the invoice relates to, and reason for delinquency, if any. 

Verify the originator name listed on each invoice and whether the name matches the name of an Originator listed in the underlying transaction documents and indicate whether the Originator is eligible. 
       
  Discuss with management the magnitude of accounts/invoices in the aging at the end of Month#2 that have been extended, modified or restructured.  
    
  Ask management to provide an aging of   debit balances only   as of a recent month end (i.e. no credits in the aging buckets).  Compare debit balance aging totals to the aging on the monthly report.  Recalculate the delinquency ratio based on debit balance aging and compare it to the ratio reported on the monthly report.   

5. 
       Dilution - Credit Memos   Rebills 
     Select 30 credit memos that were issued in the last 2-3 months (SPECIFIED MONTHS).  Compute the weighted average dilution horizon (WADH).  Prepare a table summarizing the WADH by   entity   and by   type   (returns, discounts, allowances, rebates, etc.) of credit memo.  In addition, compare this year s WADH with what was calculated in the prior audit. 

6. 
    Invoice Resolution Test  
     Select a sample of 10 invoices dating from Month 200X     (three months prior)     and trace these invoices through to resolution (i.e. collection, dilution, write-off, or delinquent).  Prepare a listing of each invoice analyzed and include this detailed information in an exhibit to your report.  Be sure to include the payment terms on the face of invoice your exhibit. 

7. 
    Delinquent Obligors  
     Obtain from management a listing of the 10 obligors that comprise the largest portion of the 61-90 DPI     aging bucket at month end Month#2.  Note what actions have been taken by management to expedite payment and the expected resolution.  Inquire as to the reasons for material past due amounts.  In your report, note whether or not these balances were paid as of the date of fieldwork.  Include this analysis as an exhibit to your report. 
    
           8. 
    Write-offs 
     Obtain an understanding of the method used to write off uncollectible accounts (i.e.: write off to an accrued allowance account or write off directly to the bad debt expense).  Review the appropriate general ledger account (e.g. bad debt allowance account) for conformity with the write offs reported on the Receivables Rollforward.  Provide an explanation for any variances noted. 
    
  Obtain from management the 5 largest write-offs in the 6-12 months ended Month#2.  Obtain an explanation for each write-off and determine which aging bucket these receivable amounts were in at the time they were written-off.  Be sure to include the date of the write-off in your analysis. Include this analysis as an exhibit to your report. 

9. 
    Collection Methodology 
     Obtain a current listing of the lockbox/collection account(s) into which collections on purchased receivables are deposited.  Compare this to the listing presented in the TAA. 

Examine the most recent bank statement/general ledger reconciliations for the 1-2 largest lockbox/collection account(s), noting the timeliness of completion and materiality of any unreconciled variances.  Which entity s name is on each of these bank statements? 
    
  Ask management to prepare a schedule for Month#1 and Month#2 summarizing collections by obligor remittance location.   
    
                         Location of Remittance:

Verify the accuracy of the information on the Excel spreadsheet by tracing the data to the bank statements, accounting records, and the monthly report.  Explain any large reconciling items. 
    
  If any of the collections are remitted directly to the company s offices, ask management where (bank name   account number) these in-house receipts are eventually deposited.  If the amount of monthly in-house collections cannot be precisely quantified, ask for an estimate.  Also, describe how promptly such collections are being deposited into the bank account (i.e. are the payments deposited within 2 business days or do they wait until the end of the week before making the deposit?).  

10. 
    Cash Applications Test 
     Select a sample of 5 cash receipts from a recent cash collections report and determine if the cash was applied to the correct invoices and if the paid invoices were promptly removed from the aging.  (In your sample, attempt to select one receipt from each of the remittance locations noted in the preceding step.)  

11. 
    Credit   Collection Policy / Credit File Review  
     Inquire as to any material changes/updates in the Credit and Collection Policy since     Month [20XX].  If so, obtain a copy of any revisions.  If not, inquire if any changes are being planned. 
    
  Select [3-5] credit files for a sample active new receivable obligors (i.e. recently granted credit for the first time) in the last 6-12 months.  Test adherence to the company s Credit Policy, including: proper credit approval, recency/date of financial information (D B, financial statements), credit references, adherence to credit limit, etc.  Prepare a listing of the files analyzed, noting your results and the adequacy of compliance with the required terms. 

Obtain the daily receivable balances for Month#1 and Month#2     (OR use daily sales and daily collections to create a pro-forma daily AR balance).  Graph this information and include   both   the underlying data and the graph in your report. 

13. 
    Contras/Payables Concentration 
     Inquire of management regarding any known contra accounts.  For any known contra accounts, obtain the receivable balance and the payable balance at month end Month#2.  Confirm that any contra offset amounts are included in the ineligible receivables calculation.  Attach your analysis as an exhibit to the report.    
    
           14. 
    Accounting Entries Relating to the Transaction  
     Determine whether the receivables being transferred were done so in accordance with the Sale Agreement and TAA     by reviewing the     most recent   the journal entries made on the books   records of the various entities involved.  In each case, be sure to note the date the entries were recorded, trace the journal entries to the respective general ledgers, and attach copies of the journal entries to your report. 

Review the entries made on the books   records of Arrow Electronics, Inc., Arrow Asia Distribution Limited, Arrow Enterprises Computing Solutions, Inc. ( Originators ) to reflect the sale of the receivables to Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation ( SPE ).  Note whether or not the funds received by Originator from the SPE were commensurate with the value of the receivables transferred.  What discount rate was used by the Originator?  Ask management to provide (ideally in writing) the rationale behind the establishment of the discount rate.   

Review the entries made on the books   records of the SPE to reflect the purchase of receivables from the Originator.   

Review the entries made on the books   records of SPE to reflect the sale of an interest in the receivables to the conduit(s).  Note that the initial funding date was [XX/XX/XX]. 

15. 
    Computer Systems   Reporting 
     Determine whether the master data processing records are marked with a legend in accordance with the terms of the TAA to indicate the ownership interest.  Ascertain the coding used to identify the purchased receivables on the system.  Briefly describe the legend and the coding in your report.  Is there a header or note on the aging indicating that the receivables are no longer owned by the Originators   (  Arrow Electronics, Inc., Arrow Asia Distribution Limited, Arrow Enterprises Computing Solutions, Inc.)?   
    
  How is the fact that the receivables are securitized reflected on the Originators    (  Arrow Electronics, Inc., Arrow Asia Distribution Limited, Arrow Enterprises Computing Solutions, Inc.  )   general ledger? 
    
  Inquire of management if any significant changes have been made to the computer systems used in servicing the receivables since [XX/XX/XX].  If so, document any changes.  If not, inquire as to whether any changes are being planned.  
    
  Inquire of management when Arrow Electronics, Inc. ( Servicer or Originator ) last tested its disaster recovery plan, what the results were, how any issues were addressed, and when the next disaster recovery test will be conducted. 

16. 
    Audits - Internal   External 
     Inquire if Internal Auditors have performed any reviews of the credit procedures and/or receivable system during [20XX/the last twelve months].  Review copies of any internal audit reports.  Include in your report a list of any issues that may pertain to the receivables being purchased and related areas (i.e. EDP, collections, invoicing or general ledger systems) and how these issues have been/will be addressed.  Discuss with the Internal Auditors their planned schedule of coverage in [20XX/the next twelve months].   

Discuss with the Public Accounting Firm ( External Auditors  or [AUDIT FIRM NAME]) the results from the receivable confirmation procedures performed in connection with the [XX/XX/XX] FYE financial audit of the Servicer or Originator - Arrow Electronics, Inc.  If possible, quantify the extent of the coverage and specify the type of procedures used (negative/positive confirmations, subsequent cash receipts), noting any issues. 
    
  Obtain a copy of the Management Letter (if any) prepared in conjunction with the [XX/XX/XX] FYE financial audit of the Servicer.  Note any weaknesses identified in the Servicer s receivable operations and/or related controls (i.e. EDP and general ledger systems).  Discuss the current status of these issues with management. 
    
  Regarding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements, review the 10K filing (Annual report - SEC, EDGAR, or Company s website).  State in your report the External Auditor s opinion on the effectiveness of the client s internal controls.  If any deficiencies are noted in their opinion, discuss with management steps taken to resolve any deficiencies relating to receivables.   

Ask management to provide details regarding any events that may impact the UCC Financing Statement filings such as mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, or any changes in corporate names, location of chief executive offices, location of books and records relative to receivables. Provide a legal organizational chart indicating where receivables are originated. Validate the listing matches the Originators listed in the underlying documents.

  Reference is made to the Transfer and Administration Agreement dated as of March __, 2001 as it may be amended or otherwise modified from time to time (as so amended or modified, the    Agreement   ) among Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation, as transferor (in such capacity, the    SPV   ), Arrow Electronics, Inc., individually (the    Arrow   ) and as master servicer (in such capacity, the    Master Servicer   ), the parties thereto as  Conduit Investors,   Alternate Investors  and  Funding Agents,  and Bank of America, National Association, a national banking association.

  [___________________] (the    Assignor   ) and [_____________________] (the    Assignee   ) agree as follows: 
  1.        The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the Assignee, without recourse and without representation and warranty, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the Assignor, an interest in and to all of the Assignor s rights and obligations under the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.  Such interest expressed as a percentage of all rights and obligations of the Related Alternate Investors, shall be equal to the percentage equivalent of a fraction the numerator of which is $[________] and the denominator of which is the Facility Limit.  After giving effect to such sale and assignment, the Assignee s Commitment will be as set forth on the signature page hereto. 
  1.        In consideration of the payment of $[___________], being [___]% of the existing Net Investment, and of $[___________], being [___]% of the aggregate unpaid accrued discount, receipt of which payment is hereby acknowledged, the Assignor hereby assigns to the Agent for the account of the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases from the Assignor, a [___]% interest in and to all of the Assignor s right, title and interest in and to the Net Investment purchased by the undersigned on March __, 2001 under the Agreement.  
  2.        Assignor (i) represents and warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such interest is free and clear of any Adverse Claim; (ii) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with the Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Agreement or the Receivables, any other Transaction Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (iii) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any of the SPV or the Master Servicer, Arrow or any Originator or the performance or observance by any of the SPV or the Master Servicer, Arrow or any Originator of any of its obligations under the Agreement, any other Transaction Document, or any instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto. 
  3.        The Assignee (i) confirms that it has received a copy of the Agreement, the First Tier Agreement and each Originator Agreement together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 6.1 of the Agreement, to the extent delivered through the date of this Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the    Assignment   ), and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Assignment; (ii) agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent, any of their respective Affiliates, any Conduit Investor, the Assignor or any other Alternate Investor and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or  

not taking action under the Agreement and any other Transaction Document; (iii) appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Related Funding Agent to take such action as Administrative Agent or the Related Funding Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent or the Related Funding Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; (iv) agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of the Agreement are required to be performed by it as an Alternate Investor; (v) specifies as its address for notices and its account for payments the office and account set forth beneath its name on the signature pages hereof; (vi) attaches the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America certifying as to the Assignee s status for purposes of determining exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to the Assignee under the Agreement or such other documents as are necessary to indicate that all such payments are subject to such rates at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, and (vii) agrees to comply with Section 9.3(f) of the Agreement.  
  4.        The effective date for this Assignment shall be the later of (i) the date on which the Related Funding Agent and the Administrative Agent, receive this Assignment executed by the parties hereto and receives the consent of the Related Funding Agent, and to the extent required under the Agreement, the SPV, and (ii) the date of this Assignment (the    Effective Date   ).  Following the execution of this Assignment and the consent of the Related Funding Agent, and to the extent required under the Agreement, the SPV, this Assignment will be delivered to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and recording. 
  5.        Upon such acceptance and recording, as of the Effective Date, (i) the Assignee shall be a party to the Agreement and, to the extent provided in this Assignment, have the rights and obligations of an Alternate Investor thereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall, to the extent provided in this Assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under the Agreement.

The Assignor and Assignee shall make all appropriate adjustments in payments under the Agreement for periods prior to the Effective Date directly between themselves. 
  7.        The Assignee shall not be required to fund hereunder an aggregate amount at any time outstanding in excess of $[___________],   minus   the aggregate outstanding amount of any interest funded by the Assignee in its capacity as a participant under any Program Support Agreement. 
  8.        The Assignor agrees to pay the Assignee its   pro     rata   share of fees in an amount equal to the product of (a) [_____]   per     annum   and (b) the Assignor s Commitment during the period after the Effective Date for which such fees are owing and paid by the SPV pursuant to the Agreement. Amounts paid under this section shall be credited against amounts payable to the Assignee under any participation agreement entered into pursuant to the Agreement. 
  9.        THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW). 
  10.        This agreement contains the final and complete integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute the entire Agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof superseding all prior oral or written understandings. 
  11.

  Exhibit I-1 
  Form of Opinion of Robert E. Klatell, Counsel to SPV, Originators and Master Servicer 
  March __, 2001 
  To the parties listed on Schedule A 
       annexed hereto 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5.1(m) of the Transfer and Administration Agreement dated as of March 21, 2001 (the    Agreement   ) among Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation, as transferor (in such capacity, the    SPV   ), Arrow Electronics, Inc., individually (   Arrow   ) and as master servicer (in such capacity, the    Master Servicer   ), the parties thereto as  Conduit Investors,   Alternate Investors  and  Funding Agents,  and Bank of America, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the  Administrative Agent ).  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Agreement. 

I have acted as counsel to Arrow, Gates/Arrow Distributing, Inc. (together with Arrow, the Applicable Originators) (in connection with the preparation of the Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement, the First Tier Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby. 
  I have examined, on the date hereof, the Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the First Tier Agreement and all exhibits thereto, each Originator Sale Agreement, certificates of public officials and of officers of the SPV, Arrow and the other Originators and certified copies of Arrow s, the others Originator s and the SPV s certificate of incorporation, by-laws, the Board of Directors  resolutions authorizing Arrow s, the other Originator s and the SPV s participation in the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement, the First Tier Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, copies of each of the above having been delivered to you.  I have also examined the closing documents delivered pursuant to the Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement and the First Tier Agreement and copies of all such documents and records, and have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for our opinion.  With respect to the accuracy of material factual matters which were not independently established, we have relied on certificates and statements of officers of Arrow, the other Originators and the SPV. 
  On the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 
           22. 
          Each of the Applicable Originators is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective state or jurisdiction of formation, has the corporate power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and had at all relevant times, and now has, all necessary power, authority, and legal right to acquire and own the Receivables and other Affected Assets, and is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation and is authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the nature of its business requires such qualification or authorization. 
     23.        Each of the Applicable Originators has the power, corporate and other, and has taken all necessary corporate action to execute, deliver and perform the Agreement, the First Tier Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, each in accordance with its respective terms, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.  The Transaction Documents to which each of Arrow and the other Originators is a party have been duly executed and delivered by Arrow and the other Originators, as applicable, and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each such party, enforceable against such party in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and by general equitable principles. 
  24.        The execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their terms by each of Arrow and the other Originators of the First Tier Agreement, Originator Sale Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) require (a) any governmental approval or (b) any consent or approval of any stockholder of Arrow or any of the other Originators that has not been obtained, (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under (a) the certificate of incorporation or the by laws of Arrow or any of the other Originators, or (b) any other agreement to which Arrow or any of the other Originators is a party or by which Arrow or any of the other Originators or any of their respective properties may be bound, or (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim upon any of the assets, property or revenue of Arrow or any of the other Originators other than as contemplated by the First Tier Agreement or the Originator Sale Agreement, as applicable. 
  25.        Except as set forth in the schedules attached hereto, there are not, in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any governmental or non-governmental body, any actions, suits, proceedings, litigation or investigations, pending or to the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry,  

threatened, (i) against the Arrow or any of the other Originators or the business or any property of such parties except actions, suits or proceedings that, if adversely determined, would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) relating to the First Tier Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
  26.        None of Arrow or any other Originator is, or is controlled by, an  investment company  within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
  The foregoing opinions and conclusions were given only in respect of the laws of [insert state or other jurisdiction], the State of New York and, to the extent specifically referred to herein, the Federal laws of the United States of America.  
  This opinion has been delivered at your request for the purposes contemplated by the Agreement.  Without our prior written consent, this opinion is not to be utilized or quoted for any other purpose and no one other than you is entitled to rely thereon; provided, that any Alternate Investor, any Program Support Provider and any placement Agent or dealer of the Conduit Investor s commercial paper may rely on this opinion as of it were addressed to them.   
  Very truly yours,

Exhibit I-2 
  Form of Opinion of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley   McCloy LLP, Counsel to the SPV, Originators and Master Servicer 
  March __, 2001 
  To the parties listed on Schedule A 
       annexed hereto 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5.1(m) of the Transfer and Administration Agreement dated as of March __, 2001 (the    Agreement   ) among Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation, as transferor (in such capacity, the    SPV   ), Arrow Electronics, Inc., individually (the    Arrow   ) and as master servicer (in such capacity, the    Master Servicer   ), the parties thereto as  Conduit Investors,   Alternate Investors  and  Funding Agents,  and Bank of America, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the  Administrative Agent ).  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Agreement. 
  We have acted as counsel to Arrow, the other Originators and the SPV in connection with the preparation of the Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement, the First Tier Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby. 
  We have examined, on the date hereof, the Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the First Tier Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the Originator Sale Agreement, certificates of public officials and of officers of the SPV, Arrow and the other Originators and certified copies of Arrow s, the others Originator s and the SPV s certificate of incorporation, by-laws, the Board of Directors  resolutions authorizing Arrow s,  

the other Originator s and the SPV s participation in the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement, the First Tier Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, copies of each of the above having been delivered to you, copies of the financing statements on Form UCC-1 filed in the filing offices listed in   Schedule I   hereto executed by each Originator (other than Arrow), as debtor, in favor of Arrow, as secured party and  showing the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Funding Agents (on behalf of the Conduit Investors and the Alternate Investor), as the assignee of the secured party substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the    Originator Financing Statements   ), copies of the financing statements filed on Form UCC-1 filed in the filing offices listed in   Schedule II   hereto executed by Arrow, as debtor, in favor of the SPV, as secured party and showing the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Funding Agents (on behalf of the Conduit Investors and the Alternate Investors), as the assignee of the secured party, substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit B   (the    Arrow Financing Statements   ) and copies of the financing statements on Form UCC-1 filed in the filing offices listed in   Schedule III   hereto executed by SPV, as debtor, in favor of the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Funding Agents (on behalf of the Conduit Investors and the Alternate Investors), as secured party, substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit C   (the    SPV Financing Statements   ).  We have also examined the closing documents delivered pursuant to the Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement and the First Tier Agreement and copies of all such documents and records, and have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for our opinion.  With respect to the accuracy of material factual matters which were not independently established, we have relied on certificates and statements of officers of Arrow, the other Originators and the SPV. 
  On the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 
           27. 
          The SPV is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, has the corporate power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and had at all relevant times, and now has, all necessary power, authority, and legal right to acquire and own the Receivables and other Affected Assets, and is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation and is authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the nature of its business requires such qualification or authorization. 
     28.        The SPV has the power, corporate and other, and has taken all necessary corporate action to execute, deliver and perform the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, each in accordance with its respective terms, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.  The Transaction Documents to which the SPV is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the SPV and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the SPV enforceable against the SPV in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and by general equitable principles. 
  29.        The execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their terms by the SPV of the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) require (a) any governmental approval or (b) any consent or approval of any stockholder of the SPV that has not been obtained, (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under (a) the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of the SPV, (b) any other agreement to which the SPV is a party or by which the SPV or any of its properties may be bound, or (c) any Law applicable to the SPV of any court or of any Official Body having jurisdiction over the SPV or any of its properties, or (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim upon any of the assets, property or revenue of the SPV other than as contemplated by the Agreement. 
  30.        The execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their terms by each of Arrow and the other Originators of the First Tier Agreement, Originator Sale Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not  

and will not (i) require (a) any governmental approval or (b) any consent or approval of any stockholder of Arrow or any of the other Originators that has not been obtained, (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under (a) the certificate of incorporation or the by laws of Arrow or any of the other Originators, (b) any other agreement to which Arrow or any of the other Originators is a party or by which Arrow or any of the other Originators or any of their respective properties may be bound, or (c) any Law applicable to Arrow or any of the other Originators of any Official Body having jurisdiction over Arrow or any of the other Originators or any of its properties, or (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim upon any of the assets, property or revenue of Arrow or any of the other Originators other than as contemplated by the First Tier Agreement or the Originator Sale Agreement, as applicable. 
  31.        Except as set forth in the schedules attached hereto, there are not, in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any governmental or non-governmental body, any actions, suits, proceedings, litigation or investigations, pending or to the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, threatened, (i) against the SPV or the business or any property of the SPV except actions, suits or proceedings that, if adversely determined, would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) relating to the Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
  32.        Except as set forth in the schedules attached hereto, there are not, in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any governmental or non-governmental body, any actions, suits, proceedings, litigation or investigations, pending or to the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, threatened, (i) against the Arrow or any of the other Originators or the business or any property of such parties except actions, suits or proceedings that, if adversely determined, would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) relating to the First Tier Agreement, the Originator Sale Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
  33.        The Receivables constitute  accounts  or  general intangibles  as that term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York. 
  34.        The Originator Sale Agreement creates a valid and enforceable security interest (as that term is defined in Section 1-201(37) of the Uniform Commercial Code (including the conflict of laws rules thereof) (the    UCC   ) as in effect in New York (the    New York UCC   ) and [insert reference to applicable jurisdiction], under Article 9 of the New York UCC [and under similar provisions of applicable jurisdiction] (   Originator Sale Security Interest   ) in favor of the SPV in the Receivables and other Affected Assets and the proceeds thereof (except that the First Tier Security Interest will attach to any Receivable created after the date hereof only when the Originator possesses rights in such Receivable).  The internal laws of [insert state or other jurisdiction] govern the perfection by the filing of financing statements of the Originator Sale Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.  The Originator Financing Statement(s) have been filed in the filing office(s) located in [insert state or other jurisdiction] listed in   Schedule I   hereto, which [is] [are] the only office(s) in which filings are required under the [insert state or other jurisdiction] UCC to perfect the Originator Sale Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof, and accordingly the Originator Sale Security Interest in each Receivable and the proceeds thereof will, on the date of the initial transfer under the First Tier Agreement, be perfected under Article 9 of the [insert state or other jurisdiction] UCC.  All filing fees and all taxes required to be paid as a condition to or upon the filing of the Originator Financing Statement(s) in [insert state or other jurisdiction] have been paid in full.  As of the date hereof, there were no (i) UCC financing statements naming the Originators  as debtor, originator or assignor and covering any Receivables or other Affected Assets or any interest therein or (ii) notices of the filing of any federal tax lien (filed pursuant to Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code) or lien of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (filed pursuant to Section 4068 of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act) covering any Receivable or other Affected Asset or any interest therein.  The filing of the Originator Financing Statements in the filing offices listed in   Schedule I   will create a first priority security interest in each Receivable.  Such perfection and priority will continue, provided that appropriate continuation statements are timely filed where and when required under the UCC.   

35.        The First Tier Agreement creates a valid and enforceable security interest (as that term is defined in Section 1-201(37) of the Uniform Commercial Code (including the conflict of laws rules thereof) (the    UCC   ) as in effect in New York (the    New York UCC   ) under Article 9 of the New York UCC (   First Tier Security Interest   ) in favor of the SPV in the Receivables and other Affected Assets and the proceeds thereof (except that the First Tier Security Interest will attach to any Receivable created after the date hereof only when Arrow possesses rights in such Receivable).  The internal laws of New York govern the perfection by the filing of financing statements of the First Tier Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.  The Arrow Financing Statement(s) have been filed in the filing office(s) located in [insert jurisdictions] listed in   Schedule II   hereto, which are the only office(s) in which filings are required under the New York UCC to perfect the First Tier Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof, and accordingly the First Tier Security Interest in each Receivable and the proceeds thereof will, on the date of the initial transfer under the First Tier Agreement, be perfected under Article 9 of the New York UCC.  All filing fees and all taxes required to be paid as a condition to or upon the filing of the Arrow Financing Statement(s) in New York have been paid in full.  As of the date hereof, there were no (i) UCC financing statements naming Arrow as debtor, originator or assignor and covering any Receivables or other Affected Assets or any interest therein or (ii) notices of the filing of any federal tax lien (filed pursuant to Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code) or lien of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (filed pursuant to Section 4068 of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act) covering any Receivable or other Affected Asset or any interest therein.  The filing of the Originator Financing Statement(s) in the filing offices listed in   Schedule II   will create a first priority security interest in each Receivable.  Such perfection and priority will continue, provided that appropriate continuation statements are timely filed where and when required under the UCC.   
  36.        The Agreement creates a valid and enforceable security interest (as that term is defined in Section 1-201(37) of the New York UCC, under Article 9 of the New York UCC (   Second Tier Security Interest   ) in favor of the Agent in each Receivable and other Affected Assets (except that the Second Tier Security Interest will attach only when the SPV possesses rights in such Receivable).  The internal laws of New York govern the perfection by the filing of financing statements of the Second Tier Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.  The SPV Financing Statement(s) have been filed in the filing office(s) located in [insert state or other jurisdiction] listed in   Schedule II   hereto, which are the only office(s) in which filings are required under the  UCC to perfect the Second Tier Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof, and accordingly the Second Tier Security Interest in each Receivable and the proceeds thereof will, on the date of the initial transfer under the Agreement, be perfected under Article 9 of the New York UCC.  All filing fees and all taxes required to be paid as a condition to or upon the filing of the SPV Financing Statement(s) in New York have been paid in full.  As of the date hereof, there were no (i) UCC financing statements naming SPV as debtor, originator or assignor and covering any Receivables or other Affected Assets or any interest therein or (ii) notices of the filing of any federal tax lien (filed pursuant to Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code) or lien of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (filed pursuant to Section 4068 of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act) covering any Receivable or other Affected Assets or any interest therein.  The filing of the SPV Financing Statement(s) in the filing offices listed in     Schedule III   will create a first priority security interest in each Receivable.  Such perfection and priority will continue, provided that appropriate continuation statements are timely filed where and when required under the UCC.   
  37.        The SPV is not, and is not controlled by, an  investment company  within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
  In giving the opinions in   paragraphs 8  ,   9   and   10  , we have assumed that Arrow s, each of the Originator s and the SPV s chief executive office will continue to be located in [insert state or other jurisdiction].  The conclusions expressed in   paragraphs 8  ,   9   and   10   are subject to the accuracy of the personnel in the filing offices referred to above with regard to the filing, indexing and recording of financing statements and notices of Adverse Claim, and to the correctness of reports to us by [____________], who performed  

the searches of such records and who made the filings on behalf of Arrow, the Originators and the SPV in [insert state or other jurisdiction]. 
  In giving the opinions set forth in   paragraphs 8  ,   9   and   10  , we have assumed that all filings as appropriate in the event of a change in the name, identity or corporate structure of the debtor (or the Originator or assignor) named in any financing statements and all continuation statements necessary under the UCC to maintain the perfection of the Originator Sale Agreement, First Tier Security Interest and the Second Tier Security Interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof will be duly and timely filed.  In giving such opinions, we also do not express any opinion as to (a) transactions excluded from Article 9 of the UCC by virtue of Section 9-104 of the UCC, (b) any security interest in proceeds except to the extent that the validity and perfection of any interest in proceeds (as such term is defined under the UCC) thereof that is covered by the Originator Financing Statements or the SPV Financing Statements or any duly filed financing statement referred to above may be permitted by Section 9-306 of the UCC, and (c) any security interest that is terminated or released. 
  The foregoing opinions and conclusions were given only in respect of the laws of [insert state or other jurisdiction], the State of New York and, to the extent specifically referred to herein, the Federal laws of the United States of America.  
  This opinion has been delivered at your request for the purposes contemplated by the Agreement.  Without our prior written consent, this opinion is not to be utilized or quoted for any other purpose and no one other than you is entitled to rely thereon; provided, that any Alternate Investor, any Program Support Provider and any placement Agent or dealer of the Conduit Investor s commercial paper may rely on this opinion as of it were addressed to them.

Exhibit I-3 
  Form of Opinion of Davies, Ward, Phillips   Vineberg LLP, Canadian Counsel to Arrow Electronics Canada Ltd. 
  March __, 2001 
           To: 
    Arrow Electronics, Inc.; 
     Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation; 
    
    Each of the Investors and Funding Agents (listed in Schedule 1 annexed hereto) party to the Transfer and Administration Agreement dated as of March 20, 2001 among Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation, Arrow Electronics, Inc., the parties thereto as  Conduit Investors,   Alternate Investors  and  Funding Agents,  and Bank of America, National Association, as administrative agent; 

Bank of America, National Association, as Administrative Agent for such Investors and Funding Agents; 
    
    Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and 
    
    Standard   Poor's Ratings Services (a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.). 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  We have acted as Quebec and Ontario counsel to Arrow Electronics Canada Ltd. (   Arrow Canada   ) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Originator Sale Agreement dated as of March 20, 2001 (the    Originator Sale Agreement   ), between Arrow Canada, as Seller, and Arrow Electronics, Inc. (   Arrow   ), as Buyer.  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Originator Sale Agreement. 
  We have examined the following documents: 
           a) 
    the Originator Sale Agreement; 
              b) 
    the certificate of an officer of Arrow Canada (the    Officer s Certificate   ), a copy of which is attached hereto as   Schedule 2  ; 
              c) 
    certified copies of Arrow Canada s certificate of amalgamation and by-laws; and 
              d) 
    directors  resolutions authorizing Arrow Canada s participation in the transactions contemplated by the Originator Sale Agreement. 
     We have made such investigations of law as we have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for our opinion.  With respect to the accuracy of factual matters upon which the opinions expressed herein are based, we have relied solely on the Officer s Certificate. 
  For the purposes of the opinion expressed herein, we have assumed the genuineness of the signatures of all parties and that the Originator Sale Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Arrow and constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto, enforceable against them according to its terms. We have also assumed that under the laws of the State of New York (   New York   ) on the date hereof, to the extent applicable, the provisions of the Originator Sale Agreement are sufficient to effect and do effect a valid sale, assignment and transfer to Arrow of the Seller Affected Assets and we have assumed that the terms of the Originator Sale Agreement will be interpreted and understood under the laws of New York to have the same meaning, content and effect as they would have under the laws of the Province of Ontario. We express no opinion as to the effect of provisions which may be implied by New York law.  We have also assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or facsimiles thereof and the authenticity of the originals of such certified or photostatic copies or facsimiles. 
  The opinions expressed herein are given only in respect of the laws of the Province of Ontario (   Ontario   ) and the laws of Canada applicable therein (   Ontario Law   ) and, with respect to the opinion expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5, the laws of the Province of Quebec (   Quebec   ) and the laws of Canada applicable therein (   Quebec Law   ).  Accordingly, we express no opinions as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. 
  On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, and the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that: 
  I:        GENERAL OPINIONS 

38. 
          Arrow Canada is a corporation duly amalgamated and validly existing under the laws of Canada, and has the corporate power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.  Arrow Canada has all necessary power, authority, and capacity to acquire and own the Seller Affected Assets. 
     39.        Arrow Canada has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Originator Sale Agreement. 
  40.        The execution, delivery, and performance in accordance with its terms by Arrow Canada of the Originator Sale Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) require any governmental approval under Ontario Law or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under the articles of amalgamation or the by-laws of Arrow Canada or Ontario Law; 
  41.        Under Ontario Law and Quebec Law, no registration, recording or filing is required in any public office of record in Ontario or Quebec, in connection with the Originator Sale Agreement, other than the filing of a financing statement pursuant to the   Personal Property Security Act   (Ontario) (   PPSA   ) and the filing of a registration pursuant to the   Civil Code of Quebec   (   CCQ   ).  A financing statement with respect to the Originator Sale Agreement was filed under the PPSA for a registration period of 10 years on March 15, 2001 as registration no. 20010135 1651 9065 8595 and file number     870652206.  Provided that the rights of Arrow under the Originator Sale Agreement are duly registered in the Register of Personal and Movable Real Rights (the    RPMRR   ) pursuant to article 1642 of the CCQ, such rights will have been duly registered in such places in Quebec as are currently necessary to render such rights under the Obligator Sale Agreement enforceable as against Obligors and Creditors (as defined below).  No opinion is expressed herein with respect to the need to amend or renew such filings in the future. 
  42.        We have conducted or caused to be conducted searches against Arrow Canada and against the names of its predecessors in title listed in Schedule 3, under the statutes and at the offices of public record set out in Schedule 3, the results of which searches were current in each case only to the respective times on the respective dates set out in Schedule 3.  Such statutes and public offices are the only statutes and public offices where, under Ontario Law and Quebec Law, transfers of interests in accounts receivable would ordinarily or customarily be the subject of a recording, filing or registration in order to create, validate, preserve, perfect or protect such transfers with respect to each of the corporations named in Schedule 3.  Such searches disclosed no security interests registered or recorded which might affect the Seller Affected Assets, except as set out in Schedule 3. 
  In giving the opinions in paragraphs 44 and 45 above, we have assumed that Arrow Canada s chief executive office is located in Ontario.  The conclusions expressed in paragraphs 44 and 45 are subject to the accuracy of the personnel in the filing offices referred to above with regard to the filing, indexing and recording of registrations, financing statements and notices of Adverse Claim. 
           43. 
             In any proceeding brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Ontario for the enforcement of the Originator Sale Agreement, the laws of New York would, to the extent specifically pleaded and proven as a fact by expert evidence, be applied by such court, in accordance with the choice of the laws of New York as the governing law of the Originator Sale Agreement, to all issues which under the conflict of laws rules of the Province of Ontario are to be determined in accordance with the proper or governing law of a contract, except that in any such proceeding such court: 
              a) 
    will apply those laws of the Province of Ontario which such court would characterize as procedural and will not apply those laws of New York which such court would characterize as procedural; 
              b) 
    will not apply those laws of New York which such court would characterize as revenue, expropriatory, penal or similar laws; and 
              c) 
    will not apply those laws of  New York the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under Ontario Law.  

44. 
             The courts of the Province of Ontario would give a judgment in Canadian dollars based upon a final and conclusive   in personam   judgment for a sum certain, obtained in a New York court against Arrow Canada with respect to a claim pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement in accordance with the submission by Arrow Canada to the jurisdiction of the court of New York without reconsideration of the merits, if: 
              a) 
    such judgment was: 
              i) 
    not obtained by fraud, or in any manner contrary to the principles of natural justice; 
              ii) 
    not for a claim in respect of any laws of New York or of any other jurisdiction other than the Province of Ontario which a court of the Province of Ontario would characterize as revenue, expropriatory, penal or similar laws; 
              iii) 
    not contrary to public policy, as such term is interpreted under Ontario Law, or contrary to any order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the   Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act   (Canada) or by the Competition Tribunal under the   Competition Act   (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to therein; and 
              iv) 
    not impeachable as void or voidable under New York law; 
              b) 
    there has been compliance with the   Limitations Act   (Ontario) which has the effect that any action to enforce a foreign judgment must be commenced within six years of the date of the foreign judgment; and  
              c) 
    no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is discovered prior to the rendering of judgment by an Ontario court. 
       
  II:        TAX OPINIONS 
  We have also been asked to consider whether, under the   Income Tax Act   (Canada) (the    Tax Act   ), any amounts paid by an Obligor of any Unpaid Balance on the Seller Receivables to Arrow would be subject to Canadian non-resident withholding tax. 
  Our opinions expressed in this section are based, in part, upon our opinions expressed above and are subject to the foregoing assumptions.  In addition, for the purposes of our opinions expressed in this section, we have assumed that, as at the date of the initial purchase and as of the date of each subsequent purchase under the Originator Sale Agreement, 
           (a) 
    the Seller Receivables do not bear any stated interest; 
              (b) 
    the Unpaid Balance of the Seller Receivables is not in excess of the fair market value of the products or services provided by Arrow Canada to the Obligor (at the time the Seller Receivables arose) to which the Unpaid Balance of the Seller Receivables relates; 
              (c) 
    Arrow Canada and the relevant Obligors are resident in Canada, and Arrow is not resident in Canada, each for the purposes of the Tax Act; 
              (d) 
    Arrow Canada and Arrow are related persons for the purposes of the Tax Act; and 
              (e) 
    each of the terms of the Originator Sale Agreement (including the calculation of the Discount Percentage) are the same terms (and calculation) as would be the case if Arrow Canada and Arrow dealt with each other at arm s length for the purposes of the Tax Act. 
     In our opinion, no amount will be required to be deducted or withheld under Part XIII of the   Income Tax Act   (Canada) from the payment of any Unpaid Balance on the Seller Receivables by the Obligor to, or for the benefit of, Arrow or any other beneficial owner of the Seller Receivables that is not resident in Canada for the purposes of the Tax Act and who subsequently acquires such interest from Arrow. 
  Furthermore, in our opinion, neither Arrow, the SPV, nor any of the Investors will, by virtue only of the transactions effected by the Originator Sale Agreement, be deemed to be a resident of Canada or carrying on business in Canada for the purposes of the Tax Act.  

III.    QUALIFICATIONS 
  The foregoing opinions are subject to the following further qualifications: 
           (a) 
    the enforceability of any provision of the Originator Sale Agreement may be limited by insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent preferences and conveyances, assignments and preferences, and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally; 
              (b) 
    equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunction, may be granted only in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction; in addition, a court might not allow a creditor to exercise rights to accelerate the performance of obligations or otherwise seek enforcement of the Originator Sale Agreement based upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial, may require that discretionary powers afforded to a party be exercised reasonably and in good faith or may decline to accept the factual or legal determinations of a party notwithstanding that a contract or instrument provides that the determination of that party shall be conclusive; 
              (c) 
    the enforceability of any provision of the Originator Sale Agreement exculpating a party from a liability or duty otherwise owed by it to another or waiving legal and equitable defences may be limited by law; 
              (d) 
    the costs of or incidental to proceedings authorized to be taken in court or before a judge are in the discretion of the court or judge and the court or judge has the full power to determine by whom and to what extent such costs shall be paid; 
              (e) 
    the enforceability of rights of indemnity or contribution provided in the Originator Sale Agreement may be limited by law; 
              (f) 
    the enforceability of the Originator Sale Agreement with respect to property forming part of the Seller Affected Assets to which the laws of Ontario apply, as against subsequent purchasers from Arrow Canada, is subject to the qualification that: 
              (i) 
    a subsequent purchaser of chattel paper (as defined in the PPSA) which forms part of the Seller Affected Assets who takes possession of the chattel paper  in the ordinary course of business, gives value and who does not know of Arrow s ownership interest therein at the time of taking possession; 
              (ii) 
    a subsequent purchaser of an instrument (as defined in the PPSA) which forms part of the Seller Affected Assets who takes possession of such collateral, gives value and who does not know of Arrow s ownership interest therein at the time of taking possession; 
              (iii) 
    a subsequent purchaser of a security (as defined in the PPSA) which forms part of the Seller Affected Assets who purchases in good faith and takes possession of such collateral, or a subsequent purchaser of such collateral who purchases in the ordinary course of business, takes possession of such collateral and does not know that the purchase constitutes a breach of the Originator Sale Agreement; 
              (iv) 
    a holder in due course of a bill, note or cheque which forms part of the Seller Affected Assets; 
              (v) 
    a loss payee or additional insured party under any policy of insurance which forms part of the Seller Affected Assets; and 
              (vi) 
    a transferee from Arrow Canada of money which forms part of the Seller Affected Assets 
     may acquire an interest therein in priority to Arrow s interest therein; 
           (g) 
    under the laws of Ontario, an Obligor may pay Arrow Canada until such Obligor receives notice, reasonably identifying the relevant rights, that the account or chattel paper has been assigned to Arrow, and, if requested by such Obligor, Arrow has furnished proof  

within a reasonable time that the assignment has been made, and, if Arrow does not do so, such Obligor may pay Arrow Canada; 
           (h) 
    under the laws of Quebec, an Obligor or the surety or guarantor of an Obligor (each also being, for the purposes of this paragraph only, an    Obligor   ) may pay Arrow Canada until either (i) such Obligor has acquiesced in the assignment; (ii) such Obligor has received a copy or a pertinent extract of the Originator Sale Agreement or any other evidence of the assignment which may be set up against Arrow Canada; or (iii) if the relevant Obligor cannot be found in Quebec, a notice of assignment has been published in a newspaper distributed in the locality of the last known address of such Obligor or, if he carries on an enterprise, in the locality where its principal establishment is situated; 
              (i) 
    in the event that any part of the Seller Affected Assets in Quebec constitutes a claim attested by a bearer instrument, as defined at article 1647 of the CCQ, the Obligor who issued it is bound to pay the debt attested thereby to any bearer who hands over the instrument to him, except where he has received notice of a judgment ordering him to withhold payment thereof; a person who has been unlawfully dispossessed of a bearer instrument forming part of the Seller Affected Assets may not prevent the Obligor who issued it from paying the claim to the person who presents the instrument except on notification of an order of a court; 
              (j) 
    to the extent that any part of the Seller Affected Assets constitutes corporeal movable property in Quebec, a subsequent purchaser thereof in good faith who is first given possession of the property is vested with the ownership thereof, even though his title may be later in time than that of Arrow; 
              (k) 
    to the extent that any part of the Seller Affected Assets constitutes corporeal movable property in Quebec, a possessor in good faith thereof acquires the ownership thereof after three years running from the dispossession of the owner. 
              (l) 
    under the laws of Quebec, the assignment of a right resulting from a contract of insurance may not be set up against the insurer, the beneficiary, or third persons until the insurer receives notice thereof; 
              (m) 
    under the laws of Quebec, an Obligor may set up against Arrow Canada or Arrow any payment made in good faith by himself or his surety to an apparent creditor, even if the Obligor or his surety has received evidence of the assignment; 
              (n) 
    no opinion is expressed regarding the existence of, or the right, title or interest of Arrow Canada to, any of the Seller Affected Assets; 
              (o) 
    to the extent, if any, that the Originator Sale Agreement purports to assign any Crown debts (as defined in the   Financial Administration Act   (Canada), no steps have been taken to provide the notices or obtain the acknowledgements provided for in Part VII of that Act.  An assignment of Crown debts not complying with that Act is ineffective as between the assignor and the assignee and as against the Crown and, therefore, there will not be a valid assignment of any such Crown debts unless that Act is complied with; 
              (p) 
    Arrow s interest may not be enforceable in respect of proceeds of the Seller Affected Assets which are not identifiable or traceable as assets of Arrow; and 
              (q) 
    to the extent that the interest of Arrow in and to the Seller Affected Assets constitutes security interests in chattel paper, accounts, claims or the proceeds thereof, such security interest may be subordinate to (i) the interest of a person who is the beneficiary of a deemed trust arising under the   Employment Standards Act   (Ontario) or under the   Pension Benefits Act   (Ontario) and (ii) the interest of a claimant under non-consensual, unregistered liens, hypothecs, trusts and claims created or imposed by statute or rule of law. 

IV:        BANKRUPTCY OPINIONS 
  You have also asked us to consider whether under Ontario Law, creditors of Arrow Canada, subsequent purchasers of the Seller Affected Assets, or a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, receiver-manager or liquidator of Arrow Canada (collectively,    Creditors   ) could look successfully to the Seller Affected Assets to satisfy a claim against Arrow Canada after the sale, assignment and transfer of the Seller Affected Assets by Arrow Canada to Arrow pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement. 
  For the purposes hereof,    Insolvency Statutes    means the   Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act   (Canada)  ,   the   Companies  Creditors Arrangement Act   (Canada)  ,   the   Assignments and Preferences Act   (Ontario) and the   Fraudulent Conveyances Act   (Ontario). 
  For the purposes of the opinions expressed in this Section IV, we have assumed that, on the Closing Date and on the date of each sale of Seller Affected Assets pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement: 
           (i) 
    Arrow Canada is not insolvent, in insolvent circumstances or on the eve of or in contemplation of insolvency or unable to meet its debts, as applicable, within the meaning of any of the Insolvency Statutes; 
              (ii) 
    Arrow Canada will not become insolvent or be put in insolvent circumstances or become unable to meet its debts, as applicable, within the meaning of any of the Insolvency Statutes by the entering into of, or immediately after completion of the transactions contemplated by, the Originator Sale Agreement; 
              (iii) 
    Arrow Canada has not received a notice that the Seller Affected Assets are the subject of a seizure by a sheriff or otherwise or the subject of a garnishment, charging or equitable execution order or notice that a trustee in bankruptcy has an interest therein; 
              (iv) 
    Arrow Canada has entered into the Originator Sale Agreement in good faith for the purpose of selling the Seller Affected Assets to, and assigning and transferring all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Seller Affected Assets to Arrow and receiving from Arrow the consideration therefor specified in the Originator Sale Agreement, and not for the purpose of injuring, obstructing, impeding, defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or oppressing the rights and claims of Creditors or others against Arrow Canada, providing payment or security for payment to Arrow or for any other purpose relating in any way to the claims of Creditors or others against Arrow Canada; 
              (v) 
    the consideration paid and to be paid by Arrow for the Seller Affected Assets pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement represents approximately the present fair market value of the Seller Affected Assets; 
              (vi) 
    Arrow Canada is not a party to any agreement with Arrow whereby Arrow would be legally responsible for the obligations of Arrow Canada; and 
              (vii) 
    Arrow Canada has not granted any security interests in the Seller Affected Assets and the Seller Affected Assets are not subject to any non-consensual unregistered liens, trusts or claims created or imposed by statute or rule of law. 
     Creditors may assert their rights only against assets in which Arrow Canada has a beneficial ownership interest, subject to the provisions of the Insolvency Statutes discussed below which, in our opinion, are not applicable.  In our opinion, to the extent that Ontario Law applies to the sale of the Seller Affected Assets, the Originator Sale Agreement is effective to validly transfer to Arrow all of Arrow Canada s right, title and interest in, to and under the Seller Affected Assets on the date of the initial sale thereunder and thereafter, the form and content of the Originator Sale Agreement is sufficient to transfer to Arrow all of Arrow Canada s right, title and interest in, to and under the Seller Affected Assets (other than those subject to the initial sale) when such assets are created or acquired by Arrow Canada.  Arrow Canada has not and will not, pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement,  

retain any beneficial interest in the Seller Affected Assets.  Accordingly, in a bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of Arrow Canada, the Seller Affected Assets would not form part of the property of Arrow Canada within the meaning of any applicable Insolvency Statute.  Arrow is a separate legal entity from Arrow Canada which, absent any agreement to the contrary, would not be legally responsible for the obligations of Arrow Canada.  As such, Creditors could not look successfully to the Seller Affected Assets to satisfy a claim which they may have against Arrow Canada, whether before or after a bankruptcy or insolvency of Arrow Canada, or in any other proceeding instituted by or against Arrow Canada under the Insolvency Statutes, in that the sale by Arrow Canada to Arrow of the Seller Affected Assets will be recognized as a sale in any such proceeding, subject to the provisions of the Insolvency Statutes discussed below which, based on the assumption noted above, are not applicable; provided, however, that if the Collections become commingled with the assets of Arrow Canada, such that they are not identifiable as property of Arrow, Arrow may not be successful in reclaiming its property by way of a trust claim or a proprietary claim under the applicable Insolvency Statute. 
  However, in the case of amounts payable under the Seller Affected Assets which have not been collected, (i) the enforcement of Arrow s rights to such payments may be affected by a stay in respect of Arrow Canada under the applicable Insolvency Statute until a court of competent jurisdiction has determined the issue of whether the transactions contemplated by the Originator Sale Agreement constitute an effective sale of the Seller Affected Assets by Arrow Canada to Arrow, (ii) the costs associated with collecting the Seller Affected Assets during such stay could be charged against such Seller Affected Assets in priority to Arrow s interest therein, (iii) the terms of such stay may preclude the termination of Arrow Canada as Sub-Servicer under the Originator Sale Agreement or the notification of the relevant Obligors of such sale by the terms of such stay, and (iv) Arrow may be required to notify the relevant Obligors of such sale and take proceedings against Arrow Canada or others who obtain payment or possession of such Seller Affected Assets or who are alleging a right to such payment or possession. 
  You have also asked us to consider whether the sale of the Seller Affected Assets pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement could be overridden or set aside by a court upon the application of Creditors pursuant to the Insolvency Statutes.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Insolvency Statutes, to the extent relevant, certain transactions may be overridden or set aside in circumstances therein specified, as follows: 
           (i) 
    a transaction entered into by an insolvent debtor with the intention of giving any of its creditors a preference over its other creditors;  
              (ii) 
    a transfer of property made with the intention of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or others of their claims against the transferor; and 
              (iii) 
    a settlement of property where the settlor subsequently becomes bankrupt. 
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the assumptions expressed herein, we are of the opinion that the sale of the Seller Affected Assets pursuant to the Originator Sale Agreement would not be overridden or set aside by a court upon the application of a Creditor pursuant to any of the Insolvency Statutes. 
  This opinion has been delivered at your request for the purposes contemplated by the Agreement.

           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Arrow Electronics, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors  (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
