NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

USA Capital Management,
Inc. ( USA Capital  or  the Company ) was incorporated on September 25, 2014 and is a Puerto Rican corporation
with its principal place of business in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Company s operations include management consulting services
and the acquisition of various properties for development. The Company has been granted tax benefits in Puerto Rico under ACT 20-2012.
This allows the Company to benefit from significant income tax advantages, including a 4% tax on taxable income. The Company will
pursue other fee generating management contracts which may include carried interest, outside of Puerto Rico. USA Capital Management,
Inc. intends to provide management services to Limited Liability Companies that are formed to promote, invest and operate business
opportunities globally. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The summary of significant
accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited condensed financial statements.
Such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's management, who are
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 

Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes included in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2016. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of
unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

CASH 

Cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities
of 90 days or less. The Company had cash of $353,976 as of September 30, 2016 and $593,611 as of December 31, 2015. The Company
has no cash equivalents. 

CONCENTRATION OF RISK 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by $103,976 and $343,611    respectively.  

INCOME TAXES 

Under ASC 740,  Income
Taxes,  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty
of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration. 

6   

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic earnings per
common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the earnings of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there were no outstanding dilutive securities. 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company follows
guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements
of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the condensed financial statements (unaudited) on a recurring
basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized
and disclosed at fair value in the condensed financial statements (unaudited) on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement
date. 

Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than quoted prices included within Level 1that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability. 

The carrying amounts
of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

NOTE 2 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

On June 12, 2015, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections
and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards Update
is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been deleted.
Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition guidance
are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the issuance
of this Update. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.
