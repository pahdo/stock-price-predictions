NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for interim
financial statements and do not include all the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States for complete financial statements. The
information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading.
The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 have
been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm.
The accounting policies and procedures employed in the preparation
of these condensed consolidated financial statements have been
derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained in Form 10-K
as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30,
2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was
derived from those financial statements. 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP") and the
rules and regulations of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission
for Interim Financial Information. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated. All adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company's
financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of
operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 have been included. The results of operations for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year. 

Description of Business 

Orbital Tracking Corp. (the  Company ) was formerly
Great West Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The Company,
through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Global Telesat
Communications Limited ( GTCL ) and Orbital Satcom
Corp. ( Orbital Satcom ) is a provider of satellite
based hardware, airtime and related services both in the United
States and internationally.  The Company s
principal focus is on growing the Company s existing
satellite based hardware, airtime and related services business
line and developing the Company s own tracking devices for
use by retail customers worldwide. 

Going Concern Considerations 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
are prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
At September 30,2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $3.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,452,463
and had cash flows used in operations in the amount of $772,935.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining
additional capital and financing. Management intends to attempt to
raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to
raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that
effect. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the
date of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and
expenses for the years then ended. Actual results may differ
significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by
management include, but are not limited to, the assumptions used to
calculate stock-based compensation, derivative liabilities,
preferred deemed dividend and common stock issued for
services.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity
of nine months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The
Company places its cash with a high credit quality financial
institution. The Company s account at this institution is
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
( FDIC ) up to $250,000.  To reduce its risk
associated with the failure of such financial institution, the
Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial
institution in which it holds deposits. 

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
accounts 

The Company has a policy of reserving for questionable accounts
based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
in its existing accounts receivable.  The Company
periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether
an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts
and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an
account may be in doubt.  Account balances deemed to be
uncollectible are charged to the bad debt expense after all means
of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. As of September 30, 2016, and
December 31, 2015, there is an allowance for doubtful accounts
of $11,229 and $0. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company s reporting currency is US Dollars. The accounts
of one of the Company s subsidiaries is maintained using the
appropriate local currency, (Great British Pound) GTCL as the
functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. Dollars at balance sheet date, shareholders' equity is
translated at historical rates and revenue and expense accounts are
translated at the average exchange rate for the year or the
reporting period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a
separate component of stockholders  equity, captioned as
accumulated other comprehensive (loss) gain. Transaction gains and
losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are
included in the statements of operations. 

The
relevant translation rates are as follows: for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 closing rate at 1.29820 US$: GBP,
average rate at 1.31320 and 1.39353 US$: GBP, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 closing rate at 1.5164 US$:
GBP, average rate at 1.55048 and 1.5322  and for the year ended 2015 closing rate at
1.47373 US$: GBP.  

Revenue Recognition and Unearned Revenue 

The Company recognizes revenue from satellite services when earned,
as services are rendered or delivered to customers.  Equipment
sales revenue is recognized when the equipment is delivered to and
accepted by the customer. Only equipment sales are subject to
warranty. Historically, the Company has not incurred significant
expenses for warranties. 

The Company s customers generally purchase a combination of
our products and services as part of a multiple element
arrangement. The Company s assessment of which revenue
recognition guidance is appropriate to account for each element in
an arrangement can involve significant judgment. This assessment
has a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue
recognition. 

Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been
met: 

Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts and customer purchase
orders are generally used to determine the existence of an
arrangement. 

Delivery
has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when
applicable, are used to verify delivery. 

The
fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment. 

Collectability
is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based primarily on
the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks
and analysis, as well as the customer s payment
history.

UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FOOTNOTES 

FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

(unaudited) 

In accordance with ASC 605-25,   Revenue Recognition 
     Multiple-Element
Arrangements,   based on the
terms and conditions of the product arrangements, the Company
believes that its products and services can be accounted for
separately as its products and services have value to the
Company s customers on a stand-alone basis. When a
transaction involves more than one product or service, revenue is
allocated to each deliverable based on its relative fair value;
otherwise, revenue is recognized as products are delivered or as
services are provided over the term of the customer
contract.  

Goodwill and other intangible assets 

In accordance with ASC 350-30-65,  Intangibles - Goodwill and
Others , the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable
intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

Factors the Company considers to be important which could trigger
an impairment review include the following: 

1. 

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results; 

2. 

Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or
the strategy for the overall business; and 

3. 

Significant negative industry or economic trends. 

When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles
may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of
the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the
asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows,
the Company records an impairment charge. The Company measures any
impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a
discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the
risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management
judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of
impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are carried at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated
service lives of the depreciable assets and is calculated using the
straight-line method. Expenditures that increase the value or
productive capacity of assets are capitalized. Fully depreciated
assets are retained in the property and equipment, and accumulated
depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. When
property and equipment are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of,
the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
included in operations. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. 

The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are generally
as follows: 

Years 

Office furniture and fixtures 

4 

Computer equipment   

4 

Appliques 

10 

Website development 

2 

Impairment of long-lived assets 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least
annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of
expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the
difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its
book value. The Company did not consider it necessary to record any
impairment charges during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.

Fair value of financial instruments 

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures , for assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition
for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that require the
use of fair value measurements which establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value
measurements. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized
below: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that
are corroborated by market data 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market
data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own
assumptions. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the derivative
liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
significant unobservable input (Level 3) from January 1, 2016 to
September 30, 2016: 

The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that
are required to be presented on the consolidated balance sheets at
fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance. The carrying
amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts payable,
and accrued expenses approximate their estimated fair market value
based on the short-term maturity of the instruments. 

Stock Based Compensation 

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements
of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires
recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of
employee and director services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments over the period the employee or director is
required to perform the services in exchange for the award
(presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires
measurement of the cost of employee and director services received
in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the
award. 

Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to
consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is
determined at the  measurement date.  The expense is
recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the
measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation
expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records
compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the
reporting date. 

Income Taxes 

The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic
740-10,   Income Taxes 
 ( ASC740-10 ) which
requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statement or tax
returns.  Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and
assets are determined based on the difference between financial
statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse.  Valuation allowances are recorded
to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more
likely than not be realized.

U.S. GAAP requires that, in applying the liability method, the
financial statement effects of an uncertain tax position be
recognized based on the outcome that is more likely than not to
occur. Under this criterion the most likely resolution of an
uncertain tax position should be analyzed based on technical merits
and on the outcome that will likely be sustained under examination.
There were no adjustments related to uncertain tax positions
recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Earnings per Common Share 

Net income (loss) per common share is calculated in accordance with
ASC Topic 260: Earnings per Share ( ASC 260 ). Basic
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net loss
per share does not include dilutive common stock equivalents in the
weighted average shares outstanding as they would be
anti-dilutive.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015, periods where the Company has a net loss,
all dilutive securities are excluded. 

The following are dilutive common stock equivalents during the
period ended: 

Related Party Transactions 

A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party
directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries,
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the
Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the
Company, its management, members of the immediate families of
principal owners of the Company and its management and other
parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of
the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be
prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party
which can significantly influence the management or operating
policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership
interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
influence the other to an extent that one or more of the
transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own
separate interests is also a related party. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not
effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a
material effect on the Company's financial statements.

NOTE 2   ORBITAL TRACKING CORP AND GLOBAL TELESAT
COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED SHARE EXCHANGE, REVERSE ACQUISITION AND
RECAPITALIZATION 

On February 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange
Agreement with   Global Telesat
Communications Limited,   a
Private Limited Company formed under the laws of England and Wales
( GTCL ) and all of the holders of the outstanding
equity of GTCL (the  GTCL Shareholders ). Upon closing
of the transactions contemplated under the Exchange Agreement the
GTCL Shareholders (7 members) transferred all of the issued and
outstanding equity of GTCL to the OTC in exchange for (i) an
aggregate of 2,540,000 shares of the common stock of the OTC and
8,746,000 shares of the newly issued Series E Convertible Preferred
Stock of the OTC with each share of Series E Convertible Preferred
Stock convertible into ten shares of common stock, (ii) a cash
payment of $375,000 and (iii) a one-year promissory note in the
amount of $122,536.  Such exchange caused GTCL to become
a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company.    

For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as
a reverse acquisition and has been treated as a recapitalization of
Orbital Tracking Corp. with Global Telesat Communications Limited
considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of
the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the
registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in a
change of control. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition and re-capitalization. The GTCL Shareholders
obtained approximately 39% of voting control on the date of Share
Exchange. GTCL was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes
and the Orbital Tracking Corp. was the acquired company.

Litigation 

From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation
relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal
course of business. The Company is not currently involved in any
pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our
knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any
proceeding to which the Company is a party or to which any of the
Company s properties is subject, which would reasonably be
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and operating results. 

NOTE
10  DERIVATIVE LIABILITY  

In June 2008, a FASB approved guidance related to the determination
of whether a freestanding equity-linked instrument should be
classified as equity or debt under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic
No. 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging   Contracts in an
Entity s Own Stock. The adoption of this requirement will
affect accounting for convertible instruments and warrants with
provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price
( down-round  provisions). Warrants with such
provisions are no longer recorded in equity and are reclassified as
a liability. 

Instruments with down-round protection are not considered indexed
to a company s own stock under ASC Topic 815, because neither
the occurrence of a sale of common stock by the company at market
nor the issuance of another equity-linked instrument with a lower
strike price is an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed
option on equity shares. 

In connection with the issuance of its 6% convertible
debentures and related warrants, the Company has determined that
the terms of the convertible warrants include down-round provisions
under which the exercise price could be affected by future equity
offerings. Accordingly, the warrants are accounted for as
liabilities at the date of issuance and adjusted to fair value
through earnings at each reporting date.  On May 17, 2016,
the Company entered into exchange agreements with holders of the
Company's outstanding $504,168 convertible notes originally issued
on December 28, 2015 pursuant to which the Notes were cancelled and
the exchanging holders were issued an aggregate of 10,083,351
shares of newly designated Series G Convertible Preferred. Upon the
conversion, additional paid in capital increased $649,662 from the
decrease in convertible notes payable of $504,168, decrease in
derivative liabilities of $146,502 and increase in Preferred Stock
Series G of $1,008.

For
accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a
reverse acquisition and has been treated as a recapitalization of
Orbital Tracking Corp. with Global Telesat Communications Limited
considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of
the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the
registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in a
change of control. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition and re-capitalization. The GTCL Shareholders
obtained approximately 39% of voting control on the date of Share
Exchange. GTCL was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes
and the Orbital Tracking Corp. was the acquired company.
The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition
include the balance sheets of both companies at historical cost,
the historical results of GTCL and the results of the Company from
the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has
been retroactively restated to reflect the
recapitalization. 

The Company is a provider of satellite based hardware, airtime and
related services both in the United States and
internationally.  We sell equipment and airtime for use
on all of the major satellite networks including Globalstar,
Inmarsat, Iridium and Thuraya and operate a short-term rental
service for customers who desire to use our equipment for a limited
time period.  Our acquisition of GTCL in February 2015
expanded our global satellite based infrastructure and business,
which was first launched in December 2014 through the purchase of
certain contracts.

GTCL, we believe we are one of the largest providers in Europe of
retail satellite based hardware, airtime and services through
various ecommerce storefronts, and one of the largest providers of
personal satellite tracking devices. Our customers include
businesses, the U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental
organizations and private consumers.  By enabling
wireless communications in areas not served or underserved by
terrestrial wireless and wireline networks and in circumstances
where terrestrial networks are not operational due to natural or
man-made disasters, we seek to meet our customers' increasing
desire for connectivity.  Our principal focus is on
growing our existing satellite based hardware, airtime and related
services business line and developing our own tracking devices for
use by retail customers worldwide.

On May
17, 2016, the Company entered into exchange agreements with holders
of the Company's outstanding $504,168 convertible notes originally

cancelled and the exchanging holders were issued an aggregate of
10,083,351 shares of newly designated Series G Convertible
Preferred Stock.

Table of Contents  

The
terms of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock are set forth in
the Certificate of Designation of Series G Convertible Preferred
Stock as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada.
The Series G COD authorizes 10,090,000 Preferred G Shares. The
Preferred G Shares are convertible into shares of common stock
based on a conversion calculation equal to the stated value of such
Preferred G Share divided by the conversion price. The stated value
of each Preferred G Share is $0.05 and the initial conversion price
is $0.05 per share, each subject to adjustment for stock splits,
stock dividends, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions or
other similar events. The Company is prohibited from effecting a
conversion of the Preferred G Shares to the extent that, as a
result of such conversion, such investor would beneficially own
more than 4.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of the Preferred G Shares. Each Preferred G
Share entitles the holder to vote on all matters voted on by
holders of common stock as a single class. With respect to any such
vote, each Preferred G Share entitles the holder to cast one vote
per share of Series G Preferred Stock owned at the time of such
vote subject to the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation. Subject
to certain specified exceptions, in the event the Company issues
securities at a per share price less than the conversion price
prior to December 28, 2016, each holder will be entitled to receive
from the Company additional shares of common stock such that the
holder shall hold that number of conversion shares, in total, had
such holder purchased the Preferred G Shares with a conversion
price equal to the lower price issuance. 

The
exchanging holders, GRQ Consultants Inc. 401K, Michael Brauser and
Intracoastal Capital LLC, are each holders of over 5% of a class of
the Company s voting securities. The Exchange Agreements
contain customary representations, warranties and agreements by the
Company and the other parties thereto. The representations,
warranties and covenants contained therein were made only for
purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely
for the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be
subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting
parties. 

On
October 26, 2016, the Company entered separate subscription
agreements with accredited investors relating to the issuance and
sale of $350,000, out of a maximum of $800,000, of shares of Series
H convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $4.00 per
share. The initial conversion price is $0.04 per share, subject to
adjustment as set forth in the Series H COD. The Company is
prohibited from effecting a conversion of the Series H Preferred
Stock to the extent that, because of such conversion, the investor
would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the number of shares of
the Company s common stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock upon
conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock.   Each  Series H Preferred Stock
 entitles the holder to cast
one vote per share of  Series H Preferred Stock  owned as of the record date for the
determination of shareholders entitled to vote, subject to the
4.99% beneficial ownership limitation. The Company received the
necessary consents as required from prior subscription agreements,
Preferred Series C, Preferred Series G and Preferred Series H, as
well as antidilution rights.  Certain shareholders have
waived their right to adjustment, equal treatment, most favored
nations and other rights to which they were entitled pursuant to
the Prior Offerings, including without limitation, certain rights
granted to holders of our Series C Preferred Stock, Series F
Preferred Stock and G Preferred Stock.  The Company was required to issue
550,000 shares of its Preferred Series C, which is convertible into
5,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock and 114,944
shares of Preferred Series I, which is convertible into 11,494,400
shares of the Company s common stock. Preferred Series I was
issued to certain holders in lieu of Preferred Series G and
Preferred Series H.  

At
September 30,2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $3.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,454,120
and had cash flows used in operations in the amount of $772,933.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining
additional capital and financing. Management intends to attempt to
raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to
raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that
effect.

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015 

Revenue.  
 Sales for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of sales of satellite
phones, accessories and airtime plans. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, revenues generated were approximately
$1,299,373 compared to approximately $982,775 of revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in total
revenues of $316,598 or 32.2%. Sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 generated approximately $3,783,230 compared to
approximately $2,955,453 of revenues during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, a $827,777 increase in total revenues or
28.0%.  

Factors relative to the increase in revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 are
related to  increased presence in several international
e-commerce storefronts, the introduction of GTC s new
mobile friendly website, and it being awarded a recurring revenue
contract for lone worker trackers from the UK Forestry Commission.
Comparable sales for Global Telesat Communications Ltd. were
$998,878 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $650,749 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $348,129 or 53.5%. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 comparable sales were $2,791,808
and $2,082,863, an increase of $708,945 or 34.0%. Comparable sales
for Orbital Satcom for the three months ended September 30, 2016
were $300,495 as compared to $332,026 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $31,531 or 9.5%. This decrease
was attributable to decreased Amazon US sales, which was more than
offset by an increase in Global Telesat Communications sales on the
same storefront following its launch in 2015. Comparable sales for
Orbital Satcom for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were
$991,422 as compared to $872,590 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $118,832 or 13.6%. 

Cost of
Sales.    During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues increased
to $1,003,026 compared to $697,862 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $305,164 or 43.7%. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, cost of revenues increased to
$2,842,986 compared to $2,130,271 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 an increase of $712,715 or 33.5%. Gross profit
margins for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016, were 22.8% and 24.9%, respectively. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, gross profit margins were 29.0%
and 27.9%, respectively. Selling and general administrative costs
decreased with certain costs being absorbed as cost of sales. We
expect our cost of revenues, to continue to increase during fiscal
2016 and beyond, as we expand our operations and begin generating
additional revenues under our current business. However, we are
unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected
increases.    

Operating Expenses. 
 Total operating expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 were $605,705, an increase of
$24,277, or 4.2%, from total operating expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 of $581,428. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were $2,152,432
an increase of $390,360 or 22.2%. Factors contributing to the
increase are described below.  

Selling, general and
administrative expenses   were
$182,276 and ($27,638) for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $209,914. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $549,526 and $429,991, respectively,
an increase of $119,535 or 27.8%. The increase during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in
2015 were due to reclassification from selling, general and
administrative to professional fees. The increase for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in
2015, was primarily due to variable expenses which increase with
sales, such as e-commerce fees, bank charges and postage and
delivery.  

Salaries, wages and payroll
taxes   were $158,720 and
$338,533 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, a decrease of $179,813 or 53.1%.  The
decrease was attributable to additional wages expensed from a prior
period for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, salaries, wages and
payroll taxes were $503,556 and $479,251, respectively, an increase
of $24,305 or 5.1%. The company has added additional personnel to
accommodate and support its revenue goals and compliance needs for
reporting as a public company, as well as, build its infrastructure
for future growth and opportunities.  

Stock-based
compensation   was $0, for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. On February 19,
2015, the Company issued options to its former Chief Executive
Officer, valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at
$107,500, as well as issued stock as compensation to its Controller
and certain consultants. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 stock based compensation was $0 as compared to $149,999 for
the same period in 2015.  

Professional fees 
 were $192,834 and $151,603 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
increase of $41,231 or 27.2%.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, professional fees were $881,318 and
$409,605, respectively, an increase of $471,713 or 115.2%. The
increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the same period in 2015, were primarily attributable
to fees incurred for investor awareness, fees associated with the
compliance requirements of public companies are included in
Professional fees, as well as fees associated with raising
capital.

Depreciation and
amortization   expenses were
$70,219 and $118,931 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $48,712 or
40.0%.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, depreciation and amortization were $216,375 and $293,226, a
decrease of $76,851 or 26.2%.   The decrease during the
2016 period was primarily attributable to decrease in amortization,
as expenses were offset to professional fees.  

We
expect our expenses in each of these areas to continue to increase
during fiscal 2016 and beyond as we expand our operations and begin
generating additional revenues under our current business. However,
we are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected
increases. 

Total Other (Income)
Expense.     Our total other (income) expenses were $30,971
compared to $4,069, during the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 respectively, increase of $26,902 or
661%.   The increase is attributable to an increase
in costs for foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations. Our
total other expenses were $241,933 compared to $18,295 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, an
increase of $223,638 or 1,222.2%.  The increase is
related to interest expense incurred for convertible debt, offset
by the decrease recognized to the change in fair value of
derivative instruments and an increase for exchange rate variances,
during the nine months ended September 30,
2016.  

Net Income (Loss) 

We
recorded net loss before income tax of $338,672 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of
$300,584, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded a net loss of
$1,452,463 as compared to a net loss of $955,185. The decrease in
income is a result of the factors as described above.

the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, of $19,888 and
$17,513. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015
$2,530 and $8,172, was recorded as a gain for foreign currency
translation adjustments. The gains are attributable to exchange
rate variances. Comprehensive loss was $318,785 as compared to loss
of $298,054 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, comprehensive loss was $1,434,951 and $947,013,
respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that are material to our
stockholders. 

Our
company has not entered into any transaction, agreement or other
contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated with us under
which we have 

an obligation under a guarantee contract, although we do have
obligations under certain sales arrangements including purchase
obligations to vendors 

a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the
unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit,
liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such
assets, 

any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract
that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument,
or 

any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a
variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by us
and material to us where such entity provides financing, liquidity,
market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing,
hedging or research and development services with
us. 

Plan of Operation 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Critical
accounting estimates are those that management deems to be most
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results
of operations, and that require management s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, due to the need to make estimates
about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have
identified our critical accounting estimates which are discussed
below. 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The Company s significant estimates
include the valuation of stock based charges, the valuation of
derivatives and the valuation of inventory reserves.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP") and the
rules and regulations of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission
for Interim Financial Information. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated. All adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company's
financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of
operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 have been included. The results of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year. 

Accounts Receivable 

The
Company extends credit to its customers based upon a written credit
policy.  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced
amount and do not bear interest.  The allowance for
doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate for the
amount of probable credit losses in the Company s existing
accounts receivable.  The Company establishes an
allowance of doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the
credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other
information.  Receivable balances are reviewed on an aged
basis and account balances are charged off against the allowance
after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential
for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not require
collateral on accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, there is an allowance for doubtful accounts
of $11,229 and $0, respectively. 

Accounting for Derivative Instruments 

Derivatives
are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
These derivatives, including embedded derivatives in the
Company s structured borrowings, are separately valued and
accounted for on the Company s balance sheet. Fair values for
exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted
market prices. Where market prices are not readily available, fair
values are determined using market based pricing models
incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment
and estimates 

Research and Development 

Research
and Development ("R D") expenses are charged to expense when
incurred. The Company has consulting arrangements which are
typically based upon a fee paid monthly or quarterly. Samples are
purchased that are used in testing, and are expensed when
purchased. R D costs also include salaries and related
personnel expenses, direct materials, laboratory supplies,
equipment expenses and administrative expenses that are allocated
to R D based upon personnel costs. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The
Company s reporting currency is US Dollars. The accounts of
one of the Company s subsidiaries is maintained using the
appropriate local currency, (Great British Pound) GTCL as the
functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. Dollars at balance sheet date, shareholders' equity is
translated at historical rates and revenue and expense accounts are
translated at the average exchange rate for the year or the
reporting period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a
separate component of stockholders  equity, captioned as
accumulated other comprehensive (loss) gain. Transaction gains and
losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are
included in the statements of operations. 

The
relevant translation rates are as follows: for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 closing rate at 1.29820 US$: GBP,
average rate at 1.31320 and 1.39353 US$: GBP, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 closing rate at 1.5164 US$:
GBP, average rate at 1.55048 and 1.5322  and for the year ended 2015 closing rate at
1.47373 US$: GBP.

Revenue Recognition and Unearned Revenue 

The
Company recognizes revenue from satellite services when earned, as
services are rendered or delivered to customers.  Equipment
sales revenue is recognized when the equipment is delivered to and
accepted by the customer. Only equipment sales are subject to
warranty. Historically, the Company has not incurred significant
expenses for warranties. 

The
Company s customers generally purchase a combination of our
products and services as part of a multiple element arrangement.
The Company s assessment of which revenue recognition
guidance is appropriate to account for each element in an
arrangement can involve significant judgment. This assessment has a
significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue
recognition. 

Revenue
is recognized when all of the following criteria have been
met: 

Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts and customer purchase
orders are generally used to determine the existence of an
arrangement. 

Delivery
has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when
applicable, are used to verify delivery. 

The
fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment. 

Collectability
is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based primarily on
the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks
and analysis, as well as the customer s payment
history. 

In accordance with ASC 605-25,   Revenue Recognition 
     Multiple-Element
Arrangements,   based on the
terms and conditions of the product arrangements, the Company
believes that its products and services can be accounted for
separately as its products and services have value to the
Company s customers on a stand-alone basis. When a
transaction involves more than one product or service, revenue is
allocated to each deliverable based on its relative fair value;
otherwise, revenue is recognized as products are delivered or as
services are provided over the term of the customer
contract.  

Property and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated service lives
of the depreciable assets and is calculated using the straight-line
method. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity
of assets are capitalized. Fully depreciated assets are retained in
the property and equipment, and accumulated depreciation accounts
until they are removed from service. When property and equipment
are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset s
carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations.
Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 

The
estimated useful lives of property and equipment are generally as
follows:

Impairment of long-lived assets 

The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The
Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected
undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value.
The Company did not consider it necessary to record any impairment
charges during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.

Fair value of financial instruments 

The
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures , for assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition
for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that require the
use of fair value measurements which establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value
measurements. 

ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally,
ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that
are corroborated by market data 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market
data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own
assumptions. 

The
following table presents a reconciliation of the derivative
liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
significant unobservable input (Level 3) from January 1, 2016 to
September 30, 2016: 

The
Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are
required to be presented on the consolidated balance sheets at fair
value in accordance with the accounting guidance. The carrying
amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts payable,
and accrued expenses approximate their estimated fair market value
based on the short-term maturity of the instruments. 

Share-Based Payments 

Compensation
cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in
the financial statements. The cost is measured at the grant date,
based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized
as an expense over the employee s requisite service period
(generally the vesting period of the equity award). 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company does not believe that any recently issued accounting
pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial
statements.

ITEM 3.  Q UANTITATIVE AND
QUALITIATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information
required by this Item. 

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES. 

We
maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ),
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in
designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and
procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

With
respect to the nine months ending September 30, 2016,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based
upon this evaluation, our management has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
September 30, 2016 due to a lack of segregation of duties and the
need for an updated accounting system. However, to the extent
possible, we will implement procedures to assure that the
initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording
of transactions will be performed by separate individuals. We
believe that the foregoing steps will remediate the significant
deficiency identified above, and we will continue to monitor the
effectiveness of these steps and make any changes that our
management deems appropriate. 

Management
is in the process of determining how best to change our current
system and implement a more effective system to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported
accurately. Our management acknowledges the existence of this
problem, and intends to develop procedures to address them to the
extent possible given limitations in financial and manpower
resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can
be made at this point that the implementation of such controls and
procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will
be adequate once implemented. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting.
