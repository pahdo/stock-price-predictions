  GLOSSARY 
                 Adjusted EBITDAR 
    Adjusted EBITDAR is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, helicopter lease and associated costs, restructuring expense (recovery), asset impairments, gain (loss) on disposal of assets, foreign exchange gain (loss), other financing income (charges) and reorganization items, net, or total revenue plus earnings from equity accounted investees less direct costs, excluding helicopter lease and associated costs, and general and administration costs. This is a non-GAAP financial measure.  

Adjusted EBITDAR margin 
    Adjusted EBITDAR margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDAR divided by total revenue less reimbursable revenue. Cost reimbursements from customers are recorded as reimbursable revenue with the related reimbursement expense in direct costs. This is a non-GAAP financial measure.  

EMS 
    Emergency medical services. 

Heavy helicopter 
    A category of twin-engine helicopters that requires two pilots, can accommodate 16 to 26 passengers and can operate under instrument flight rules, which allow daytime and nighttime flying in a variety of weather conditions. The greater passenger capacity, larger cabin, longer flight range, and ability to operate in adverse weather conditions make heavy helicopters more suitable than single engine helicopters for offshore support. Heavy helicopters are generally utilized to support the oil and gas sector, construction and forestry industries and SAR and EMS customer requirements. 

Long-term contracts 
    Contracts of three years or longer in duration. 

Medium helicopter 
    A category of twin-engine helicopters that generally requires two pilots, can accommodate eight to 15 passengers and can operate under instrument flight rules, which allow daytime and nighttime flying in a variety of weather conditions. The greater passenger capacity, longer flight range, and ability to operate in adverse weather conditions make medium helicopters more suitable than single engine helicopters for offshore support. Medium helicopters are generally utilized to support the oil and gas sector, construction and forestry industries and SAR and EMS customer bases in certain jurisdictions. Medium helicopters can also be used to support the utility and mining sectors, as well as certain parts of the construction and forestry industries, where transporting a smaller number of passengers or carrying light loads over shorter distances is required. 

MRO 
    Maintenance, repair and overhaul. 

New technology 
    When used herein to classify our helicopters, a category of higher-value, recently produced, more sophisticated and more comfortable helicopters, including Airbus Helicopters H225, H135, H145 and H155; AgustaWestland s AW139; and Sikorsky s S76C++ and S92A. 

OEM 
    Original equipment manufacturer. 

PBH 
    Power-by-the-hour. A program where a helicopter operator pays a fee per flight hour to an MRO provider as compensation for repair and overhaul components required in order for the helicopter to maintain an airworthy condition. 

Rotables 
    Helicopter parts that can be repaired and reused such that they typically have an expected life approximately equal to the helicopters that they support. 

SAR 
    Search and rescue.

1. 
    Voluntary filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11")  :    
     We have incurred net losses since our acquisition on September 16, 2008 of the entity formerly known as CHC Helicopter Corporation. We have a substantial level of indebtedness and operating lease commitments and have experienced a significant decline in consolidated revenues due to the downturn in the oil and gas industry since mid-2014. As a result of this, on May 5, 2016 (the  Petition Date ), CHC Group Ltd. and a number of its subsidiaries (cumulatively referred to as the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions (the  Bankruptcy Petitions  or the  Petitions ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the  Bankruptcy Court ), seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ). The Bankruptcy Court entered an order providing for the joint administration of the Bankruptcy Cases under the caption   In re CHC Group Ltd., et al.  , which we refer to together as the  Bankruptcy Cases .  
  The Petitions filed by the Debtors seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the indenture, dated October 4, 2010, that governs the   9.250%   Senior Secured Notes Due 2020 (the  senior secured notes  the indenture, dated May 13, 2013, that governs the   9.375%   Senior Notes Due 2021 (the  senior unsecured notes  our senior secured revolving credit facility, dated as of January 23, 2014 (the  revolving credit facility ) and our asset-based revolving credit facility, dated June 12, 2015 (the  ABL Facility ). In addition, this also caused an event of default under the terms of all of our helicopter lease agreements and certain other obligations.  
  The Debtors have filed motions, net of withdrawn motions, for the rejection or abandonment of   87   helicopters in our fleet which we no longer need in the operation of our business. This includes   82   leased helicopters and   5   helicopters financed under our ABL Facility. The revised abandonment motion for   5   helicopters financed under our ABL Facility included a motion to restructure the financing terms of the remaining   8   helicopters with an amended principal balance, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court by order dated December 5, 2016.  As of   December 13, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   74   helicopter lease rejections. Discussions with our lenders and lessors remain ongoing, the status of those discussions remain fluid, and the outcome of such discussions cannot be assured. 
  On October 11, 2016, the Debtors entered into a plan support agreement (as has and may be amended the  PSA ) with respect to the terms of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the  Plan ) with holders representing   67.6%   of the senior secured notes and   73.6%   of the senior unsecured notes (including the Consenting Creditor Parties (as hereinafter defined)), the official committee of unsecured creditors ( UCC ) in the Bankruptcy Cases, and Milestone Aviation Group Limited and its affiliates (the  Lead Lessor ) (collectively, the  Consenting Creditor Parties ).  On November 11, 2016, the Debtors filed the Plan and the related disclosure statement (the  Disclosure Statement ) with the Bankruptcy Court.  The Consenting Creditor Parties, other than the UCC, have agreed to vote to accept the Plan, except in certain circumstances, and the UCC has agreed to support the Plan and recommend that unsecured creditors vote to accept it. The PSA and related agreements are subject to customary closing conditions, approval by the Bankruptcy Court, receipt of a Bankruptcy Court approved disclosure statement and solicitation materials, and contain termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events. The Plan is subject to acceptance by the Debtors  creditors (as and to the extent required under the Bankruptcy Code) and confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court. 
  The principal provisions of the Plan are as follows: 
             
    The Company has agreed to solicit participation in a   $300.0 million   rights offering (the  Rights Offering ) of second lien convertible notes (the  Second Lien Convertible Notes ) to eligible holders of senior secured and senior unsecured notes, with   $280.0 million   allocated to eligible holders of senior secured notes and   $20.0 million   allocated to eligible holders of senior unsecured notes. 
                
    The Second Lien Convertible Notes will be issued at a   10%   original issuance discount and include a   $100.0   million premium for the equitization of the secured notes secured claims, resulting in a total of   $433.3 million   in aggregate principal amount. The Second Lien Convertible Notes will have a   3.5   year maturity and are mandatorily convertible into   85.4%   of the New Membership Interests ( New Membership Interests ) to be issued by a newly-formed Cayman limited liability company (the  Reorganized Company ) on a fully diluted basis (but subject to dilution by the management incentive plan of the Reorganized Company ( MIP )) upon maturity or certain specified conditions.

  (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars unless otherwise noted, except share and per share information) 

The Second Lien Convertible Notes will rank second to the collateral securing a new credit facility in a principal amount to be determined (the  Exit Credit Facility ) to be provided to holders of claims of the revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Agreement Claims  will not bear or pay interest other than in connection with an event of default; and will have the same rights with respect to dividends and voting as New Membership Interests on an as-converted basis.   
     Holders of the senior secured notes, senior unsecured notes and general unsecured claims will receive the following general treatment under the Plan: 
             
    In addition to the ability to participate in the Rights Offering allocated to the senior secured notes, all holders of senior secured notes will receive their pro rata share of   79.5%   of New Membership Interests (prior to dilution by Second Lien Convertible Notes and the MIP), which equates to   11.6%   of New Membership Interests (fully diluted on account of the Second Lien Convertible Notes, but excluding the MIP). 
                
    All holders of the senior unsecured notes will receive their pro rata share of   8.9%   of New Membership Interests (prior to dilution by the Second Lien Convertible Notes and the MIP), which equates to   1.3%   of New Membership Interests (fully diluted on account of the Second Lien Convertible Notes, but excluding the MIP). 
                
    All other holders of allowed general unsecured claims of the Company will receive their share of (a)   11.6%   of New Membership Interests (prior to dilution by the Second Lien Convertible Notes and the MIP), which equates to   1.7%   of New Membership Interests (fully diluted on account of the Second Lien Convertible Notes, but excluding the MIP), and (b)   $37.5 million   in new unsecured notes of the Reorganized Company, less the amount of cash distributed to certain holders of allowed general unsecured claims who are to receive cash for administrative convenience ( New Unsecured Notes ). The New Unsecured Notes will have a   seven   year maturity and an interest rate of   5.0%  , payable in kind until the conversion of the Second Lien Convertible Notes and thereafter payable in cash. The New Unsecured Notes will rank pari passu with the Second Lien Convertible Notes and will be deemed senior indebtedness of the Reorganized Company, but will not have the benefit of any security or be convertible into New Membership Interests. 
                
    Upon the effective date, the Reorganized Company will adopt the MIP, including a reservation of ten percent (  10%  ) of the New Membership Interests on a fully diluted basis for distribution thereunder. 
                
    Holders of allowed Revolving Credit Agreement Claims will receive their pro rata share of the Exit Credit Facility or such treatment that would otherwise satisfy Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. The terms of the Exit Credit Facility are under negotiation. 
                
    The Plan does not provide for any distribution to holders of the Company s existing equity securities, including its ordinary shares and preferred shares. 
     The Plan distinguishes between a Primary General Unsecured Claim and a Secondary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan).  The Plan provides that each holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan) against the Debtors will receive, in full and final satisfaction and discharge of such holder s rights with respect to and under such Allowed General Unsecured Claim, and, in accordance with the Restructuring Transactions as provided in the Disclosure Statement to the Plan: (i) on account of its Allowed Primary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan), its Pro Rata share of the Primary General Unsecured Claims Distribution (as defined in the Plan), plus (ii) on account of any Allowed Secondary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan), against one or more Secondary Recovery Debtors (as defined in the Plan), if applicable, its Pro Rata share of the Secondary General Unsecured Claims Distribution (as defined in the Plan) allocated to the applicable Secondary Recovery Debtor against which it holds an Allowed Secondary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan).  For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder of Allowed General Unsecured Claims holds an Allowed Secondary General Unsecured Claim against any Debtor that is not a Secondary Recovery Debtor, such holder will not receive any additional recoveries on account of such claim. 
  In connection with the Plan, the Company has entered into a backstop agreement (the  Backstop Agreement ) pursuant to which certain of the Consenting Creditor Parties have agreed to backstop the Rights Offering (the  Backstop Commitment ). Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment, certain of the Consenting Creditor Parties, severally and not jointly, have agreed to fully participate in the Rights Offering and purchase the Second Lien Convertible Notes in

accordance with the percentages set forth in the Backstop Agreement to the extent unsubscribed under the Rights Offering in exchange for a principal amount of   $30.8 million   of Second Lien Convertible Notes (the  Put Option Premium ).  Upon certain triggering events, the Put Option Premium will become fully due and payable in   two   equal installments of approximately   $10.665 million  . 
  In addition, as part of the Plan, the Company has entered into an agreement with the Lead Lessor, pursuant to which, among other things, the Lead Lessor has agreed to restructure its existing aircraft fleet leasing arrangements with the Company and to provide a new   $150.0 million   asset-based debt facility. The key terms of this agreement include the restricting of lease rental for the helicopters that will remain in the Debtors  fleet, the consensual return of certain helicopters, extension options for certain of the retained helicopters, leases for additional helicopters and the payment of certain fees and expenses.  
  Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have operated their business as  debtors-in-possession.  The Debtors continue to operate their businesses and manage their properties as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Any efforts by creditors to enforce such payment obligations as existed before the Petition Date are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Petitions, and the holders  rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court has approved certain motions for the payment of certain pre-petition obligations, including those related to certain taxes, employee wages, severance and helicopter part repair orders.  
  These conditions result in material uncertainty that gives rise to substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that we will require significant debt, lease and other restructuring to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the Bankruptcy Court and our creditors  approval of the Plan or alternative successful restructuring. Our ability to continue as a going concern will also be dependent on our ability to implement the Plan, to maintain existing management, customer, vendor and other relationships, and to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings, amongst other factors. 
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements ( interim financial statements ) have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern or as a consequence of the Bankruptcy Cases. While operating as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, we may sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course of business, for amounts other than those reflected in the accompanying interim financial statements.

    Significant accounting policies  : 
              (a) 
    Basis of presentation: 
     The interim financial statements include the accounts of CHC Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.  The interim financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information.  Accordingly, the interim financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures for complete financial statements.  
  In the opinion of management, these interim financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated.  Results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the entire year.   
  The financial information as of   April 30, 2016   is derived from our annual audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016  .  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended

April 30, 2016  , which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016   which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 15, 2016.   
           (b)  
    Bankruptcy accounting and disclosures: 
     As a result of the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, we have applied the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 852   Reorganizations   in preparing our interim financial statements. ASC 852 requires that financial statements distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings have been recorded in a reorganization line item in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the bankruptcy reorganization process have been classified on the balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise. These liabilities are reported as the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. 
  In connection with an emergence from the Bankruptcy Cases, the Company may be required to adopt fresh-start accounting, upon which the Company s assets and liabilities will be recorded at their fair value. The fair values of the Company s assets and liabilities as of that date may differ materially from the recorded values of its assets and liabilities as reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company s adoption of fresh-start accounting may materially affect its results of operations following the fresh-start reporting dates as the Company may have a new basis in its assets and liabilities. Consequently, the Company s financial statements may not be comparable with the financial statements prior to that date and the historical financial statements may not be reliable indicators of its financial condition and results of operations for any period after it adopts fresh-start accounting. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the fresh-start accounting on its consolidated financial statements.

    Comparative figures: 
     In December 2015, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved a reverse share split, by way of consolidation, whereby all of the Company s ordinary shares of capital stock (issued and unissued) were adjusted to reflect the reverse share split ratio of   30  :1 (that is, each 30 shares of stock were consolidated into one share).  The reverse share split was effective on December 11, 2015. The principal effects of the reverse share split were as follows:

  (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars unless otherwise noted, except share and per share information) 

all capital stock par value and authorized and issued per share information were adjusted retroactively for all prior periods presented to reflect the reverse share split ratio. This includes the calculations of our weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding and net loss per ordinary share available to common stockholders; 
                
    proportional adjustments were made to the number of ordinary shares available for issuance under the CHC Group Ltd. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2013 Incentive Plan ) and those subject to outstanding equity awards (including stock options, time-based restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, service vesting stock options and shares and share price performance options and shares). Additionally, the exercise price of any stock options outstanding under the 2013 Incentive Plan and those subject to other outstanding equity awards were proportionally adjusted to reflect the reverse share split ratio; and  
                
    proportional adjustments were made to the per-share conversion price of the Company s redeemable convertible preferred shares ( preferred shares ) in accordance with the Rights and Restrictions of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares. The reverse share split had no impact on the total number of authorized preferred shares nor the number of preferred shares issued and outstanding or its par value. 
              (e) 
    Recent accounting pronouncements adopted: 
     Consolidation: 
  On May 1, 2016, we adopted the amendment to the accounting guidance on the consolidation standard.  The amendment includes updates relating to the criteria to determine whether a service provider or decision maker is a variable interest entity ( VIE ), whether a decision maker is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or whether a related party has the characteristics of a primary beneficiary of a VIE. We determined that there was no material impact on our financial results from the adoption of this standard. 
  Debt issuance costs: 
  On May 1, 2016, we adopted the accounting guidance on debt issuance costs. The new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an asset and must be applied retrospectively. As a result, we presented the   $26.2 million   of deferred financing costs previously classified in other assets at April 30, 2016 as an offset to debt obligations. This had no impact on our net loss or operating cash flows as previously reported.  
  Share-based compensation:  
  On May 1, 2016, we adopted amended guidance for accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendment requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.  The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that such performance condition would be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. There was no material impact on our financial results from the adoption of this standard.

(f)  
    Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted: 
     Revenue recognition: 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard creates a five-step model for revenue recognition to achieve the objective of recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The five-step model includes (1) identifying the contract, (2) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and (5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation has been satisfied. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition.  
  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period; companies are permitted to early adopt the standard for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2018.  Companies are allowed to use either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We are currently evaluating which transition approach to use and the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Going concern: 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued a new standard that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures when certain criteria are met. The standard is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Inventories: 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued an amendment that requires management to reduce inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than the lower of cost or market value.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein and early application is permitted. We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Financial instruments: 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the standard for the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities which introduces new reporting requirements and simplifies some of the existing reporting requirements.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early application is permitted.  We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2018.  Companies should apply the amendment using a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, and using a prospective approach for amendments to equity securities with fair values that are not readily determinable.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Leases: 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the standard for the recognition and measurement of leases.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early application is permitted.  We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Share-based compensation: 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued amendments to simplify the standard for employee share-based payment accounting.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period providing all amendments are adopted in the same period.  We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2017.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Derivatives and hedging: 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the standard for derivatives and hedging clarifying the requirements for assessing whether contingent put and call options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2017.  Companies should adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Impairment of financial instruments: 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that adds an impairment model called the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL ) model for financial instruments within the scope of the guidance, which includes loans, trade receivables, debt securities classified as Held to Maturity and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the new guidance, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity would be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The standard does not make changes to the existing impairment models for non-financial assets such as fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill. We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2020.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Statement of cash flows: 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the standard for classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. In November 2016, the FASB issued further amendments which require all entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The revised standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the standard on May 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

    Variable interest entities  : 
              (a) 
    VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary  : 
              (i) 
    Local ownership VIEs  : 
     Certain areas of operations are subject to local governmental regulations that may limit foreign ownership of aviation companies. Accordingly, operations in certain jurisdictions may require the establishment of local ownership entities that are considered to be VIEs. The nature of our involvement with consolidated local ownership entities is as follows: 
  Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016   contains a description of our principal involvement with VIEs and the accounting policies regarding determination of whether we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  As of   October 31, 2016  , there have been no significant changes in either the nature of our involvement with, or the accounting policies associated with the analysis of VIEs as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016  , with the exception of Atlantic Aviation Limited and Atlantic Aviation FZE (collectively  Atlantic Aviation ).  
  On June 16, 2016, the Company, Atlantic Aviation and the Nigerian Company entered into a Termination and Exit Agreement (the  Termination Agreement ) which replaces the framework

agreement but does not immediately terminate the other related agreements in place between the Company, Atlantic Aviation Limited and the Nigerian Company. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Company has agreed to work with Atlantic Aviation and the Nigerian Company to ensure an orderly wind-down of operations in Nigeria and the ultimate dissolution of Atlantic Aviation (and all associated agreements between the Company and Atlantic Aviation). During the three months ended July 31, 2016 we deconsolidated Atlantic Aviation, which, net of the redeemable non-controlling interest, had no material impact to our results.  
  The following table shows the redeemable non-controlling interests relating to the local ownership VIEs that are included in the interim consolidated financial statements: 

We have assessed that under the terms of the put and call arrangements with the holder of the non-controlling interest of EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. s ( EHOB ) that it is probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable and accordingly, it is recorded at its redemption amount. We have elected to recognize any changes in the redemption amount immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest to equal the redemption amount at the end of the reporting period. Reductions in the carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest are only recorded if we have previously recorded increases in the carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest. The change in redemption amount is recognized in additional paid-in capital and as a deduction or addition to the numerator of the net loss per ordinary share calculation. The redemption amount is based on a formula of   $14.5 million   plus an amount representing compounded interest, commencing October 31, 2014, which increases from   10%   for the first year to   20%   for the fifth year and thereafter.   
  Under the amended Shareholders  Agreement, the put and call options will be exercisable on the earlier of: (a) an exit event, being the entering into an agreement with another investor to acquire the Class A shareholder s interest in EHOB anytime after October 30, 2016, (b)   one   year after First Reserve Management, L.P. ( First Reserve ) and Clayton, Dubilier   Rice ( CD R ) own less than   5%   of our issued shares, and (c) October 30, 2020. Furthermore, the Class A shareholder also holds a call option over our Class B shares which is exercisable only in the event of bankruptcy. The right to immediate exercise of the put and call option by the Class A shareholder, due to the Debtors filing Petitions with the Bankruptcy Court on May 5, 2016, has been waived until December 16, 2016, subject to certain terms and conditions.  We are in the process of finalizing a longer term waiver. 
  Financial information of local ownership VIEs 
  All of the local ownership VIEs and their subsidiaries have the same purpose and are exposed to similar operational risks and are monitored on a similar basis by management. As such, the financial information reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations for all local ownership VIEs has been presented in the aggregate below, including intercompany amounts with other consolidated entities:

    Accounts receivable securitization  : 
     As described in note 3(a)(ii) of the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016  , we entered into trade receivables securitization transactions to raise financing, through the sale of pools of receivables, or beneficial interests therein, to a VIE, Finacity Receivables   CHC 2009, LLC ( Finacity ), which we have determined we are required to consolidate as we are the primary beneficiary. Our trade receivables securitization arrangement ended in April 2016, as the Petitions filed with the Bankruptcy Court on May 5, 2016 constituted a termination event under the terms of our receivable purchase agreements. 
  The following table shows the assets and the associated liabilities related to the securitization arrangements that are included in the interim financial statements: 

(iii) 
    Trinity Helicopters Limited  : 
     As at   October 31, 2015 and 2016  , we leased   two   helicopters from Trinity Helicopters Limited ( Trinity ), an entity considered to be a VIE, which we have determined we are required to consolidate as we are the primary beneficiary.

    VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary  :

     Thai Aviation Services ( TAS ) 
  As described in note 3(b)(i) of the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016  , we had a   29.9%   interest in the ordinary

shares of TAS, which we have determined to be a VIE that we are not required to consolidate as we are not the primary beneficiary.  Under the terms of the shareholder agreement we exercised our right to require the majority shareholder in TAS to purchase our ordinary share interest.  The transaction was completed on October 6, 2016 for net proceeds of   $35.5 million  .  A gain on sale of   $11.8 million   was recognized and presented within earnings from equity accounted investees during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  .  
  The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for TAS in the consolidated balance sheets prior to the date of sale:    

As of   October 31, 2015 and 2016  , we leased   eight   helicopters and   five   helicopters, respectively, to TAS and provided crew, insurance, maintenance and base services.  The total revenue earned from providing these services was   $11.9 million   and   $23.5 million   for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015, respectively, and   $5.1 million   for the period from August 1, 2016 to the date of sale and   $14.9 million   for the period from May 1, 2016 to the date of sale. 
           (ii) 
    Other VIE lessors  :  
     We have determined that the activity that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the lessor VIEs is the remarketing of the helicopters at the end of the lease term. As we do not have the power to make remarketing decisions, we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the lessor VIEs. 
  As at   October 31, 2015 and 2016  , we leased from various entities considered to be VIEs   103   helicopters and   70   helicopters, respectively. All   103   and   70   leases were considered to be operating leases as at   October 31, 2015 and 2016  , respectively, some of which are subject to rejection motions filed by the Debtors as detailed in note   10  . 
   
           4. 
    Restructuring  : 
     We are undergoing a comprehensive review of our operations, organizational structure and fleet with the view to reducing operating costs. In connection with the ongoing review, we have incurred restructuring expenses consisting of employee related severance costs and other associated costs. The majority of the payments relating to the accrual as at   October 31, 2016   will be made in fiscal 2017.  
  We have also incurred restructuring expenses related to contractual lease, maintenance and other costs on specific leased helicopters we have permanently ceased use of in operations and do not form part of our prospective fleet strategy. All restructuring amounts related to leased aircraft have either been charged to reorganization items, net, as these have been approved for rejection by the Bankruptcy Court or adjusted to restructuring expense, as we have re-evaluated our assessment that we have permanently ceased use of these leased helicopters due to changes in our fleet plans.  
  The following table summarizes the activity of the restructuring liability for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016  :

(i) 
    The restructuring expense (recovery) includes certain estimates related to the timing and costs of restructuring activities. Any adjustments to these estimates, including as a result of changes in our fleet plans, are reflected at each period end.  
              (ii) 
    We have adjusted the restructuring liability for leases which have been approved for rejection by the Bankruptcy Court. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded the expected allowed claim from the lessors on approval of the lease rejections (note   10  ).  
     As of   October 31, 2016  , we have expensed   $90.7 million   of employee related severance and other costs and   $84.3 million   of lease associated costs cumulatively to date under this restructuring review. 

5. 
    Asset impairments  :  
     During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015  , we recorded an impairment charge of   $10.5 million   to increase our provision for obsolete and excess inventories on certain consumable inventories. This impairment charge resulted from the identification of consumable inventories that were in excess of our requirements. This was driven primarily by the significant and longer than initially expected decline in the price of oil and gas, which impacts our view of future utilization of these parts and resulting changes to our fleet and inventory management strategies. Excess consumable inventories have been measured at estimated market value, based on our experience with sales of surplus consumable inventories and our assessment of resale market conditions.   
  During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , we recorded an impairment charge of   $2.7 million   to write-down the carrying value of   one   H155 helicopter to its fair value.

7. 
    Other assets  : 

(a) 
    We enter into long-term revenue agreements, which provide for pricing denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the parties to the contract. This pricing feature was determined to be an embedded derivative which has been bifurcated for valuation and accounting purposes. The embedded derivative contracts and forward contracts are measured at fair value and included in other assets and/or other liabilities (  note 8  ). The gains and losses due to the change in fair value are recognized in the statement of operations as part of other financing income (charges) (  note 13  ). The fair value of the foreign currency embedded derivatives is determined to be a recurring Level 2 fair value measurement determined using a present value model. There were no transfers between categories in the fair value hierarchy.     
              (b)  
    As of   October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   71   helicopter lease rejections. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded the expected allowed claim from the lessors on the Bankruptcy Court s approval of the lease rejection (  note 11  ) with all lease related assets and liabilities adjusted to reorganization items, net (  note 10  ). The lessors  rights of enforcement for those claims will be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

    As of   October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   71   helicopter lease rejections. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded the expected allowed claim from the lessors on the Bankruptcy Court s approval of the lease rejection (  note 11  ) with all lease related assets and liabilities adjusted to reorganization items, net (  note 10  ). The lessors  rights of enforcement for those claims will be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

    Debt obligations  : 

(a) 
    Event of default: 
     On May 5, 2016, the Debtors filed Petitions seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code, which constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility as described in   note 1  .  
  As a result of the Petitions filed by the Debtors seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code on May 5, 2016 and based on our Plan, the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility, the ABL Facility and all of our capital lease obligations were reclassified as liabilities subject to compromise in accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  . We have ceased recognition of interest expense on the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility from the Petition Date. The aggregate contractual interest due under the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility was   $27.3 million   and   $54.8 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , respectively. All unamortized deferred financing costs on these obligations were charged to reorganization items, net, during the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  .  
           (b) 
    Revolving credit facility: 
     During the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  , certain letters of credit provided to third parties prior to the Petition Date were drawn on our revolving credit facility. 
  During   the three months ended     October 31, 2016  , we reclassified the revolving credit facility as a liability subject to compromise based on our Plan and charged to reorganization items, net, all unamortized deferred financing costs on this facility. We have continued recognition of interest expense on this facility in accordance with the Plan. See   note 10   for further information on reorganization items, net and   note 11   for further information regarding liabilities subject to compromise.  
           (c)  
    Carrying value of other financial instruments, measured at other than fair value: 
     The carrying values of the other financial instruments, which are measured at other than fair value, approximate fair value due to the short term to maturity, collateral and security ranking, except for non-revolving debt obligations. The carrying value, excluding deferred financing costs, and fair value of non-revolving debt obligations were as follows:

The fair value of the senior secured and senior unsecured notes is determined based on market information provided by third parties which is considered to be a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 

10. 
    Reorganization items, net  :  
     Transactions and events directly associated with the reorganization are required, under the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations,   to be separately disclosed and distinguished from those of the ongoing operations of the business. We have used the classification  Reorganization items, net  on the consolidated statements of operations to reflect expenses, gains and losses that are the direct result of the reorganization of our business. 

(a) 
    Adjustments to debt obligations: 
     Due to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions and based on our Plan, the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility were reclassified as liabilities subject to compromise. Following the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have expensed   $3.9 million   and   $30.9 million   related to the deferred financing costs and unamortized net discount on these obligations during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  .  
           (b) 
    Adjustments to allowed claims for rejected leases: 
     The Debtors have filed motions, net of withdrawn motions, for the rejection or abandonment of   87   helicopters in our fleet which we no longer need in the operation of our business. This includes   82   leased helicopters and   5   helicopters financed under our ABL Facility.  
  As of   October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   71   helicopter lease rejections. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded the expected allowed claim from the lessors on approval of the lease rejections of   $668.2 million  . The expected allowed claim has been determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease agreement, and generally includes the present value of all future lease payments for the remaining contract term, or a default termination amount, plus damages, including those related to the return condition of the helicopter.  
  Our estimate of the expected amount of the allowed claim is a significant estimate. As the estimation process is inherently uncertain, future actions and decisions by the Bankruptcy Court may differ significantly from our own estimate, potentially having material future effects on our financial statements. Furthermore, these liabilities are reported as the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. There may be significant variation between the settled amount and the expected amount of the allowed claim. The lessors  rights of enforcement for those claims will be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.    
  We have also charged     to reorganization items all lease related assets and liabilities on the approved lease rejections. These balances include capitalized modifications, deferred lease financing costs, prepaid helicopter

rentals, security deposits, funded and unfunded residual value guarantees, deferred gains on sale-leasebacks of helicopters, capital lease assets and obligations and restructuring liabilities.  
  The Bankruptcy Court has approved interim lease deals with several lessors. On approval of the final terms of these leases by the Bankruptcy Court, the lessors may have a claim for the reduction in rentals and other costs associated with these leases. We will recognize the expected amount of these allowed claims upon Bankruptcy Court approval of these agreements. 
           (c)  
    Adjustments to other allowed claims: 
     The commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases constituted an event of default with our Canadian Supplemental Retirement Plan Agreements with certain plan participants, who could demand payment under one or more renewable letters of credit related to the participant s benefit liabilities. As a result, we recognized a settlement loss of approximately   $13.0 million   during   six months ended     October 31, 2016  , comprised of the net reduction in projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  All of our foreign currency forward contract arrangements were terminated during the three months ended July 31, 2016. We have recorded the adjustment from the fair value to the expected amount of the allowed claim for these derivative liabilities of   $4.0 million   during the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  .  
           (d)  
    Professional fees:  
     During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , we incurred   $23.3 million   and   $48.0 million   related to professional advisors who are assisting us with the bankruptcy process, respectively.  

11. 
    Liabilities subject to compromise  :    
     As a result of the Petitions filed by the Debtors seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code on May 5, 2016 and based on our Plan, the Debtors  pre-petition liabilities, including our obligations under the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility, were classified as subject to compromise based on our assessment of these obligations following the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations.    
  Pre-petition liabilities subject to compromise are required to be reported at the amount expected to be allowed as a claim by the Bankruptcy Court, regardless of whether they may be settled for lesser amounts and remain subject to future adjustments based on negotiated settlements with claimants, actions of the Bankruptcy Court, rejection of executory contracts, proofs of claims or other events. The following table reflects pre-petition liabilities subject to compromise as at   October 31, 2016  :  

12. 
    Condensed combined and consolidated debtor-in-possession financial information  :  
     The financial statements below represent the condensed combined financial statements of the Debtors. The non-filing entities are accounted for as non-consolidated subsidiaries in these financial statements and, as such, their net loss is included using the equity method of accounting. Intercompany transactions among the Debtors have been eliminated in the financial statements presented below. Intercompany transactions among the Debtors and the non-filing entities have not been eliminated.

    Other financing income (charges)  :  

(a) 
    During July and August 2015, one of our subsidiaries repurchased   $40.6 million   of the senior unsecured notes on the open market at prices ranging from   50.50%   to   55.25%   of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest of   $0.5 million  .  A gain on extinguishment of   $3.1 million   and   $17.8 million   related to the discount on repurchase, net of the unamortized deferred financing costs, was recognized during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015  , respectively.

During the three months ended   October 31, 2015 and 2016  , we recorded income tax expense of   $3.9 million   and   $11.2 million  , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of   (10.4)%   and   (9.4)%  , respectively. During the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015 and 2016  , we recorded income tax expense of   $9.9 million   and   $11.2 million  , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of   (12.5)%   and   (1.2)%  , respectively. 
  During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , we recorded an additional accrual of   $1.8 million   for a new uncertain tax position. There was also a release of   $3.1 million   of an uncertain tax position during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  . The income tax expense reflects primarily the current corporate income taxes in taxable jurisdictions and withholding taxes. For most jurisdictions we determined that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized and therefore we continue to recognize a valuation allowance in respect of these deferred tax assets. 
  As of   October 31, 2016  , there was   $27.5 million   in unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $21.8 million   would have an impact on the effective tax rate, if recognized. 
  The total amount of interest and penalties accrued on the consolidated balance sheets at   April 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2016   was   $10.2 million   and   $9.5 million  , respectively.  

15.    
    Employee pension plans  : 
     The net defined benefit pension plan expense (income) is as follows: 

We have provided limited guarantees to third parties under some of our operating leases relating to a portion of the residual helicopter values at the termination of the leases, which have terms expiring between fiscal   2017   and   2024  . Our exposure under the asset value guarantees including guarantees in the form of funded and unfunded residual value guarantees is approximately   $171.8 million   as at   April 30, 2016   and   $10.8 million   at   October 31, 2016  , exclusive of   $165.8 million   of funded and unfunded residual value guarantees for helicopter lease rejections which were approved by the Bankruptcy Court as at   October 31, 2016  .  

We have helicopter operating leases for   154   helicopters and   86   helicopters at   April 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2016  , respectively. As at   October 31, 2016  , these leases had expiry dates ranging from fiscal   2017   to   2025  .  For those helicopters where we have an unexercised option to purchase them for agreed amounts, the purchase options do not constitute bargain purchase options and we do not have a commitment to exercise the options.  
  As at   October 31, 2016  , we have commitments with respect to operating leases for helicopters, buildings, land and equipment. The Debtors have filed motions for the rejection of leases for   82   helicopters in our fleet which are no longer required in the operations of our business. As of   October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   71

helicopter lease rejections. Approved helicopter lease rejections have been reflected in reorganization items, net, at the expected amount of the allowed claim (  note 10  ).  
  The minimum lease rentals required under operating leases are payable in the following amounts over the following years ended   October 31  , exclusive of approved helicopter lease rejections but inclusive of lease rejections still subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may substantially alter our minimum lease rentals. The May 5, 2016 filing of the Petitions by the Debtors in the Bankruptcy Court caused an event of default under the terms of all of our helicopter lease agreements. Any efforts by creditors to enforce such payment obligations as existed before the Petition Date are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Petitions, and the holders  rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. We continue to make the required payments for the post-petition period for helicopter leases for which we have not filed motions for rejection with the Bankruptcy Court. 

(i)  
    The helicopter operating lease commitment excludes all lease rejections approved by the Bankruptcy Court (note   10  ). These commitments do not reflect the reduction in lease obligations as a result of Bankruptcy Court approved interim lease arrangements, with final lease terms subject to agreement with the respective lessors and approval by the Bankruptcy Court. 
     As at   October 31, 2016  , we have a total commitment of   $236.8 million   for the purchase of new helicopters, for which we have contractual commitments to pay in fiscal   2017   (  $170.6 million  ) and   2018   (  $66.2 million  ). We also have additional flexible orders of   $247.5 million   which allow us to monitor the market recovery before confirming dates and the type of aircraft for deliveries. Our additional flexible orders can also be cancelled with no further payment, subject to periodic forfeitures of deposits paid to date, up to a maximum of   $28.9 million   in forfeitures. Each of these contracts are subject to ongoing negotiations and/or rejection as part of our reorganization process. 

(a) 
    Legal proceedings: 
     One or more of our subsidiaries are, from time to time, named as defendants in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. Such disputes may involve, for example, breach of contract, employment, wrongful termination and tort claims. We maintain adequate insurance coverage to respond to most claims. We cannot predict the outcome of any such lawsuits with certainty, but we do not expect the outcome of pending or threatened legal matters to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. 
  On May 5, 2016, the Debtors filed the Petitions commencing the Bankruptcy Cases. As a result of the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, attempts to prosecute, collect, secure or enforce remedies with respect to pre-petition claims against the Debtors are subject to the automatic stay provisions of Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, including litigation relating to the Debtors. Notwithstanding the general application of the automatic stay described above, certain foreign governmental authorities, foreign courts and foreign parties may argue that the automatic stay does not apply in their jurisdiction and seek to continue any ongoing litigation. 
  The two securities class action lawsuits that were previously filed against the Company were consolidated into a single action,   Rudman et al. v. CHC Group et al.  , which is pending in federal district court for the Southern District of New York.  A consolidated amended complaint was filed on November 6, 2015. The

amended complaint alleges that the Company and others failed to disclose in our IPO materials that one of our major customers, Petrobras, had suspended payments on certain contracts due to the global stand-down of Airbus H225 aircraft. By opinion dated November 7, 2016, the Court dismissed all claims with prejudice.  The time for plaintiffs to appeal that dismissal has not yet expired. Defendants have reached an agreement-in-principal to resolve all claims, which will be incorporated into a settlement agreement and submitted for Court approval. The settlement amount would be fully paid by the Company s insurer.  
  In addition, from time to time, we are involved in tax and other disputes with various government agencies. The following summarizes certain of these pending disputes: 
  On May 2, 2008, Brazilian customs authorities seized   one   of our helicopters (customs value of   $10.0 million  ) as a result of allegations that we violated Brazilian customs law by failing to ensure our customs agent and the customs agent s third-party shipping company followed approved routing of the helicopter during transport. We secured release of the helicopter and are disputing through court action any claim for penalties associated with the seizure and the alleged violation. We preserved our rights by filing a civil action against our customs agent for any losses that may result. The State Court of S o Paulo has ruled that our agent will be responsible for the value of the helicopter if the government s seizure is upheld. That decision is under appeal. At   October 31, 2016  , it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter, or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our Brazilian subsidiary is disputing claims from the Brazilian tax authorities that it was not entitled to certain credits in 2004 and 2007. The tax authorities are seeking up to   $2.4 million   in additional taxes plus interest and penalties. We believe that based on our interpretation of tax legislation and well established aviation industry practice we are in compliance with all applicable tax legislation and plan to defend this claim vigorously. At   October 31, 2016  , it is not possible to determine the outcome of this matter or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our Brazilian subsidiary is also disputing assessments from the municipal governments in Maca  and Cabo Frio related to cross-border flights and invoicing. The municipalities are seeking up to   $4.8 million   in taxes and penalties. We do not believe the Company is liable for these amounts and will continue to dispute these assessments at the administrative level before the Municipal Tax Secretary in each jurisdiction. At   October 31, 2016  , it is not possible to determine the outcome of this matter or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  On July 30, 2014, the United Kingdom Treasury Solicitors filed a claim against us and various other parties involved in the SAR-H procurement process, which was terminated by the Ministry of Transport in February 2011. The claim is for recovery of the Ministry of Transport s wasted procurement costs of    15.8 million   (  $19.3 million  ) in respect of the SAR-H bid. We dispute the bases for the claim and intend to vigorously defend against it. The trial is listed to start in April or May 2017. At   October 31, 2016  , it is not possible to determine the outcome of this matter, or the significance, if any, to our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
           (b)  
    Contingent professional fees: 
     We have entered into fee arrangements with financial advisors to assist us with our Bankruptcy filing. The arrangements include contingent fee payments up to   $14.2 million  , payable upon completion of Chapter 11 reorganization. At   October 31, 2016  , no contingent fee amounts were accrued.

On November 30, 2016, the Debtors filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject the lease for our Boundary Bay facility.  In accordance with ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we will record to reorganization items, net, the related leased assets and liabilities and our estimate of the allowed claim on approval of the motion by the Bankruptcy Court. Our operations from the Boundary Bay facility have been relocated to other nearby facilities.  
    
  By order dated December 5, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved a motion for the abandonment of   5   helicopters financed under our ABL Facility and approved a binding term sheet (the  ABL Term Sheet ) for revised terms to the ABL Facility. The terms of the ABL Term Sheet include, but are not limited to, an amended principal balance subdivided into portions among the   8   restructured aircraft, an amended termination date, continued monthly interim payments during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases in full satisfaction of all administrative expense and adequate protection claims, a catch-up payment within   5   business days of the effective date of the revised ABL Facility, and a   $78.0 million   general unsecured non-priority pre-petition claim on the effective date of the revised ABL Facility. The transaction remains subject to final documentation.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD A ) is intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and where appropriate, factors that may affect future performance. The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the interim financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, filed with the SEC on July 15, 2016, and the MD A contained therein. In the discussion that follows, the terms  prior year quarter  and  current year quarter  and  prior year period  and  current year period  refer to   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015   and   2016  , respectively. The following discussions include forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the  Item 1A. Risk Factors  section to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. 
  We have prepared the interim financial statements assuming that we will continue as a going concern, despite our recurring net losses, substantial level of indebtedness and operating lease commitments, significant decline in consolidated revenues and filing for bankruptcy protection on May 5, 2016 described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. However, our independent registered public accountants Ernst   Young LLP have included an emphasis of matter paragraph in their auditors  report, which states certain conditions exist which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the above and incorporated by reference to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. See  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  in our audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.

Our MRO capabilities enable us to perform heavy structural repairs, and maintain, overhaul and test helicopters and helicopter components globally across various helicopter types. Our MRO services include complete maintenance outsourcing solutions, parts sales and distribution, engineering services, design services and logistics support. 
    
  Voluntary Filing under Chapter 11 
  On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code. This action was the result of our determination that the cost of our capital and leasing structure is no longer sustainable and we are unable to absorb the ongoing and precipitous decline in business demand from the oil and gas industry. Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have operated their business as  debtors-in-possession.  The Debtors continue to operate their businesses and manage their properties as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Any efforts by creditors to enforce such payment obligations as existed before the Petition Date are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Petitions, and the holders  rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court has approved certain motions for the payment of certain pre-petition obligations, including those related to certain taxes, employee severance and helicopter part repair orders. Additional information about the Bankruptcy Cases, including which entities are Debtors, is available at www.kccllc.net/chc. Neither the foregoing website nor the information contained on the website nor the documents accessible through such website shall be deemed incorporated into, and neither shall form a part of this Quarterly Report. 
  The Debtors have filed revised motions, net of withdrawn motions, for the rejection or abandonment of   87   helicopters in our fleet which we no longer need in the operation of our business. This includes   82   leased helicopters and   5   helicopters financed under our ABL Facility. During the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court approved   71   lease rejections, and as of   December 13, 2016  ,   74   helicopter lease rejections had been approved and the motion to abandon the   5   aircraft under our ABL Facility was approved on by the Bankruptcy Court by order dated December 5, 2016. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded an expected allowed claim from the lessors on approval of the lease rejections as of   October 31, 2016   of   $668.2 million  . As the estimation process is inherently uncertain, future actions and decisions by the Bankruptcy Court may differ significantly from our own estimate, potentially having material future effects on our financial statements. Furthermore, these liabilities are reported as the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. There may be significant variation between the settled amount and the expected amount of the allowed claim. The lessors  rights of enforcement for those claims will be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The approved helicopter lease rejections have reduced our minimum lease rentals by approximately   $640.0 million  .  
  The Petitions filed by the Debtors seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the senior secured notes, senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility. As of the Petition Date, certain of the Debtors  pre-petition liabilities, including the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility, were classified as liabilities subject to compromise.  During the three months ended October 31, 2016, we reclassified the revolving credit facility as a liability subject to compromise based on our Plan.  Following the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have expensed   $30.9 million   related to the deferred financing costs and unamortized net discount on these obligations during the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  . We ceased recognition of interest expense on the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility, from the Petition Date. We continued recognition of interest expense on the revolving credit facility in accordance with our Plan. In addition, the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases constituted an event of default with our Canadian Supplemental Retirement Plan Agreements with certain plan participants, who could demand payment under one or more renewable letters of credit related to the participant s benefit liabilities. As a result we recognized a settlement loss of approximately   $13.0 million   during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , comprised of the net reduction in projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  Effective on the Petition Date, our ordinary shares ceased trading on the OTCQX International Market and began trading on the OTC Pink Marketplace, under the symbol  HELIQ . We expect that our existing ordinary shares will be extinguished upon our emergence from Chapter 11, and existing shareholders will likely not receive consideration in respect of their share interests.

Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization 
  On October 11, 2016, the Debtors entered into the PSA with respect to the terms of the Plan representing holders of   67.6%   of the senior secured notes and   73.6%   of the senior unsecured notes, the UCC, and the Lead Lessor. On November 11, 2016, the Debtors filed the Plan and the Disclosure Statement with the Bankruptcy Court. The Consenting Creditor Parties, other than the UCC, have agreed to vote to accept the Plan, except in certain circumstances, and the UCC has agreed to support the Plan and recommend that unsecured creditors vote to accept it. The PSA and related agreements are subject to customary closing conditions, approval by the Bankruptcy Court, receipt of a Bankruptcy Court approved disclosure statement and solicitation materials, and contain termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events. The Plan is subject to acceptance by the Debtors  creditors (as and to the extent required under the Bankruptcy Code) and confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court.  
  The principal provisions of the Plan are as follows: 
             
    The Company has agreed to solicit participation in a   $300.0 million   rights offering of the Second Lien Convertible Notes to eligible holders of senior secured and senior unsecured notes, with $280.0 million allocated to eligible holders of senior secured notes and $20.0 million allocated to eligible holders of senior unsecured notes. 
                
    The Second Lien Convertible Notes will be issued at a 10% original issuance discount and include a $100.0 million premium for the equitization of the secured notes secured claims, resulting in a total of $433.3 million in aggregate principal amount. The Second Lien Convertible Notes will have a 3.5 year maturity and are mandatorily convertible into 85.4% of the New Membership Interests on a fully diluted basis (but subject to dilution by the MIP) upon maturity or certain specified conditions.  
                
    The Second Lien Convertible Notes will rank second to the collateral securing the Exit Credit Facility to be provided to holders of Revolving Credit Agreement Claims; will not bear or pay interest other than in connection with an event of default; and will have the same rights with respect to dividends and voting as New Membership Interests on an as-converted basis.   
     Holders of the senior secured notes, senior unsecured notes and general unsecured claims will receive the following general treatment under the Plan: 
             
    In addition to the ability to participate in the Rights Offering allocated to the senior secured notes, all holders of senior secured notes will receive their pro rata share of 79.5% of New Membership Interests to be issued by the Reorganized Company (prior to dilution by Second Lien Convertible Notes and the MIP), which equates to 11.6% of New Membership Interests (fully diluted on account of the Second Lien Convertible Notes, but excluding the MIP). 
                
    All holders of the senior unsecured notes will receive their pro rata share of 8.9% of New Membership Interests (prior to dilution by the Second Lien Convertible Notes and the MIP), which equates to 1.3% of New Membership Interests (fully diluted on account of the Second Lien Convertible Notes, but excluding the MIP). 
                
    All other holders of allowed general unsecured claims of the Company will receive their share of (a) 11.6% of New Membership Interests (prior to dilution by the Second Lien Convertible Notes and the MIP), which equates to 1.7% of New Membership Interests (fully diluted on account of the Second Lien Convertible Notes, but excluding the MIP), and (b) $37.5 million in New Unsecured Notes. The New Unsecured Notes will have a seven year maturity and an interest rate of 5.0%, payable in kind until the conversion of the Second Lien Convertible Notes and thereafter payable in cash. The New Unsecured Notes will rank pari passu with the Second Lien Convertible Notes and will be deemed senior indebtedness of the Reorganized Company, but will not have the benefit of any security or be convertible into New Membership Interests. 
                
    Upon the effective date, the Reorganized Company will adopt the MIP, including a reservation of ten percent (10%) of the New Membership Interests on a fully diluted basis for distribution thereunder. 
                
    Holders of allowed Revolving Credit Agreement Claims will receive their pro rata share of the Exit Credit Facility or such treatment that would otherwise satisfy Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. The terms of the Exit Credit Facility are under negotiation. 
                
    The Plan does not provide for any distribution to holders of the Company s existing equity securities, including its ordinary shares and preferred shares. 
     The Plan distinguishes between a Primary General Unsecured Claim and a Secondary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan).  The Plan provides that each holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan) against the Debtors will receive, in full and final satisfaction and discharge of such holder s rights with respect to and under such Allowed General Unsecured Claim, and, in accordance with the Restructuring Transactions as provided in the Disclosure Statement to the Plan: (i) on account of its Allowed Primary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan), its Pro Rata  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

share of the Primary General Unsecured Claims Distribution (as defined in the Plan), plus (ii) on account of any Allowed Secondary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan), against one or more Secondary Recovery Debtors (as defined in the Plan), if applicable, its Pro Rata share of the Secondary General Unsecured Claims Distribution (as defined in the Plan) allocated to the applicable Secondary Recovery Debtor against which it holds an Allowed Secondary General Unsecured Claim (as defined in the Plan).  For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder of Allowed General Unsecured Claims holds an Allowed Secondary General Unsecured Claim against any Debtor that is not a Secondary Recovery Debtor, such holder will not receive any additional recoveries on account of such claim. 
  In connection with the Plan, the Company has entered into a backstop agreement pursuant to which certain of the Consenting Creditor Parties have agreed to backstop the Rights Offering. Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment, certain of the Consenting Creditor Parties, severally and not jointly, have agreed to fully participate in the Rights Offering and purchase the Second Lien Convertible Notes in accordance with the percentages set forth in the Backstop Agreement to the extent unsubscribed under the Rights Offering in exchange for the Put Option Premium.  Upon certain triggering events, the Put Option Premium will become fully due and payable in two equal installments of approximately $10.665 million. 
  In addition, as part of the Plan, the Company has entered into an agreement with the Lead Lessor, pursuant to which, among other things, the Lead Lessor has agreed to restructure its existing aircraft fleet leasing arrangements with the Company and to provide a new   $150.0 million   asset-based debt facility. The key terms of this agreement include the restricting of lease rental for the helicopters that will remain in the Debtors  fleet, the consensual return of certain helicopters, extension options for certain of the retained helicopters, leases for additional helicopters and the payment of certain fees and expenses.          
   
  Segments 
  We report under two operating segments as well as a Corporate segment that provides general and administration functions. Our two operating segments are as follows:  
  Helicopter Services: 
             
    Our Helicopter Services segment consists of flying operations, primarily serving our offshore oil and gas customers and providing SAR and EMS to government agencies and to our oil and gas customers. The majority of our customers are major national and independent oil and gas companies. The majority of our revenue from oil and gas customers is from contracts tied to our customers  offshore production operations, with a substantial portion related to transporting personnel to and from offshore drilling rigs.  
                
    Our operations are global. Approximately half of our Helicopter Services segment s revenue is derived from the North Sea, from our main bases Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.  
     Heli-One: 
             
    Our Heli-One segment includes a global network of helicopter maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, and maintenance and engineering professionals, providing services for our fleet and for our external customer base primarily in Europe, Asia and North America. Although intersegment revenues are eliminated from the presentation of our consolidated financial information, operationally, Heli-One s largest customer is our Helicopter Services segment.  
                
    Heli-One also provides single-source PBH support for aircraft models from multiple manufacturers, where the customer pays a ratable monthly charge, typically based on the number of hours flown, for all scheduled and un-scheduled maintenance.  
      
  Key Drivers Affecting our Results of Operations  
       
  Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, including those described under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  section to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, and those described below:  
             
    General level of offshore production and drilling activity.   Demand for our services depends primarily upon ongoing offshore hydrocarbon production and the capital spending of oil and gas companies and the level of offshore drilling activity. Higher activity levels can lead to greater utilization of our helicopters by our customers.  
     
   50 

     Table of Contents  

Impact of fleet mix.   Generally, contracts for our helicopter services requiring heavier and newer helicopters can provide an opportunity to generate greater profit than lighter and older helicopters. Consequently, we believe our revenue and profit opportunities can improve as we upgrade our fleet and enter into new contracts.  
                
    Timing of new contracts and our commencement of service under new contracts.   Our results of operations in a particular period can be impacted by the timing of the execution of new contracts and our ability to provide services     under new contracts.  
      
  Outlook 
  Since mid-2014, there has been a severe and prolonged decline in Brent crude oil prices due to a combination of sustained high supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and from North America, and more recently due to additional supply from Iran as a result of the lifting of sanctions, coupled with weaker demand due to economic uncertainty in China, Europe, and the United Kingdom. As the weakness in the price of oil has continued since mid-2014, the length and depth of the decline in oil and gas prices has put severe pressure on the industry. Our oil and gas customers continue to implement substantial reductions in their exploration projects and are actively reducing their capital and operating expenditure plans. As our customers are actively managing their costs, we have seen increased pricing pressure on us and the impact of changes in activity levels.  
  This continued downward pressure to reduce prices and the volatility in the oil and gas sector generally, and the potential impact of such volatility on offshore exploration and production, has had a significant negative impact on the demand for offshore helicopter transportation services. We have seen continued reductions in activity across all of our regions during the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  , for both oil and gas production and exploration customers.  We have terminated the arrangement with our partner in Nigeria. We have completed the disposal of our investment in Thai Aviation Services. However, we have been able to extend and win new contract work in Australia and in Norway during the current year period and we continue to look for new opportunities and work with our existing customers to provide solutions. We believe that helicopter service is the most efficient and often the only viable or permitted form of transportation in many jurisdictions. Though we believe that in the longer term oil platforms are increasingly moving further offshore, and new, larger and more complex platform designs will mean that long-term demand for new technology medium and heavy helicopters will increase, the continued significant economic uncertainty means that this longer-term demand for new technology medium and heavy helicopters has been significantly outweighed by continued cost reductions across the industry due to uncertainty over future Brent crude prices. The significant reduction in customer demand had resulted in an increasing number of our helicopters in our fleet becoming unproductive. However, during the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court approved   71   helicopter lease rejections relating to unproductive aircraft in our fleet.  
  On April 29, 2016, one of our Airbus H225 helicopters was involved in an accident near the Flesland Airport in Bergen, Norway. Pending the outcome of the investigation, we have suspended, together with other operators, flying operations of the H225 and AS332 L2 helicopter types. The H225 helicopter is one of two types of heavy, new technology helicopters in our fleet. We have substituted Sikorsky S92A and other aircraft types where appropriate to continue to serve our customers  needs. The Bankruptcy Court has approved the rejection of all of our leased H225 helicopters which has substantially reduced the number of H225 helicopters in our fleet. It is too early to determine the extent of the impact of the accident on our results of operations or financial condition based on information currently available.   We are complying fully with all regulatory requirements.     See   Aviation Safety and Regulatory Developments  included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016   for further information.  
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the United Kingdom will negotiate the terms of their future relationship with the EU. We face uncertainties regarding how the United Kingdom s access to the EU Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory and labor environments, especially in the United Kingdom and EU, will be impacted by the United Kingdom s vote to exit the EU, including the resulting impact on our business and that of our customers. We are uncertain about the future regulatory implications of the United Kingdom s exit from the EU. There could be increased regulatory complexities that may affect our business and how customers flying in the North Sea region may be impacted. Finally, the United Kingdom s exit may also affect currency exchange rates and adversely impact our revenues leading to additional economic uncertainty. The foreign exchange loss in the prior year period increased by   $29.5 million   to a   $49.1 million   foreign exchange loss in the six months ended October 31, 2016, due in part to the significant decline in the British Pound Sterling since June 2016.  
  We conduct our business in various foreign jurisdictions, and as such, our cash flows, revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations and related risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our reported results have been negatively impacted as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies compared to the prior year,

primarily because approximately half of our Helicopter Services  revenue is derived from the North Sea region and is transacted primarily in the local currencies of that region. Throughout the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  , our primary foreign currency exposures were related to the Norwegian Kroner, the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar.  
   
  Aviation Safety and Regulatory Developments  
  On April 29, 2016, one of our Airbus H225 helicopters was involved in an accident near the Flesland Airport in Bergen, Norway. Authorities subsequently confirmed fatalities of the 11 passengers and two crew members on board. As with any similar event, this accident could result in legal and regulatory proceedings, liability and/or additional litigation and/or sanctions, which could materially adversely impact our revenue, profitability and/or operations. See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including  Operating helicopters involves a degree of inherent risk and we are exposed to the risk of losses from safety incidents  for further information.   
  Following the incident, we immediately suspended all H225 helicopter flights, with the exception of those aircraft dedicated to life-saving SAR missions, in line with regulatory authorities in Norway and the United Kingdom, and out of respect for our work force and those of our customers, and to evaluate any implications associated with the accident. 
  Within a week of the accident, the Accident Investigation Branch Norway ( AIBN ) stated that based on the information available, the H225 helicopter suffered in-flight separation of the main rotor hub from the main gearbox. As a precautionary measure, and while investigations are ongoing, Airbus Helicopters issued Emergency Airworthiness Service Bulletin ( EASB ) 553-A-058 and   Revision 1 to EASB 553-A-058  , and the   European Aviation Safety Agency   ( EASA )   issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive ( EAD ) 2016-0089  , for additional inspection regimes. 
  On June 1, 2016, the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) issued another Safety and Operational Directive, which confirmed that as a result of the updated preliminary report from the AIBN   (published on June 1, 2016)   and contact with the United Kingdom CAA, it was decided that the scope of their Airbus Helicopters H225 and AS332 L2 Safety Directives would be extended to all operations, including SAR operations. The United Kingdom CAA issued a similar Directive on June 2, 2016.     Pending further investigation to determine the root cause of the accident, and development of mitigating measures by Airbus Helicopters, EASA decided, as an additional precautionary measure, to temporarily ground the fleet, but permit single ferry flights without passengers to recover aircraft to suitable maintenance locations if required. This was communicated via an EAD.  
  On June 28, 2016, the AIBN released another preliminary report regarding the likely cause of the accident, which is available at http://www.aibn.no/Aviation/Investigations/16-286. Neither the foregoing website nor the information contained on the website nor the report accessible through such website shall be deemed incorporated into, and neither shall be a part of, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  Subsequently, EASA released a further EAD (number 2016-0199) on October 7, 2016 which lifted the temporary grounding with effect from October 13, 2016. Whilst the latest EAD permits a return to commercial operations, there remain technical issues on which CHC requires further detail to inform our Safety Case for any Return to Service.  Both the Norwegian and United Kingdom CAAs have confirmed that their Operational Directives, prohibiting the commercial use of H225 and AS332 L2 aircraft in those two countries, remain in force.  It is too early to determine the extent of the impact of the accident on our results of operations or financial condition based on information currently available. We are complying fully with all regulatory requirements.  
  On August 23, 2013, one of our Airbus Helicopters AS332 L2 helicopters was involved in an accident near Sumburgh in the Shetland Isles, United Kingdom. Authorities subsequently confirmed four fatalities and multiple injuries among the 16 passengers and two crew members on board. The cause of the accident was subject to full investigation by the United Kingdom Air Accident Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) and ongoing investigation by Police Scotland. As with any similar event, this accident could result in legal and regulatory proceedings, liability and/or additional litigation and/or sanctions, which could materially adversely impact our revenue, profitability and/or operations. See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including  Operating helicopters involves a degree of inherent risk and we are exposed to the risk of losses from safety incidents  for further information.  
   On March 15, 2016, the United Kingdom AAIB issued its final report on this accident. A full copy of the final report is available at https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aircraft-accident-report-aar-1-2016-g-wnsb-23-august-2013. Neither the foregoing website nor the information contained on the website nor the report accessible through such website shall be deemed incorporated into, and neither shall be a part of, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Kingdom AAIB did not identify technical fault as causal factors in the accident. It is too early to determine the extent of the impact of the accident on our results of operations or financial condition based on information currently available. 
   
  Fleet 
  We have continued efforts to right-size our fleet to match customer demand. Due to the downturn in the oil and gas industry, a significant portion of our fleet had become unproductive. As of   October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   71   helicopter lease rejections. We are in the process of rejecting or abandoning a significant portion of our leased helicopter fleet which we no longer need in the operation of our business, including helicopters financed under our ABL Facility. We will continue to adjust our fleet size and mix to meet customer demand and requirements.  
  As of   October 31, 2016  , our fleet was comprised of the following helicopters, excluding the   71   helicopters which the Bankruptcy Court had approved the helicopter lease rejections: 

(i) 
    EMS only. 
     On April 29, 2016, one of our Airbus H225 helicopters was involved in an accident near the Flesland Airport in Bergen, Norway. Pending the outcome of the investigation, we have suspended, together with other operators, flying operations of the H225 and AS332 L2 helicopter types.  
  As at   October 31, 2016  , we have a total commitment of   $236.8 million   for the purchase of new helicopters, for which we have contractual commitments to pay in fiscal   2017   (  $170.6 million  ) and   2018   (  $66.2 million  ). We also have additional flexible orders of   $247.5 million   which allow us to monitor the market recovery before confirming dates and the type of aircraft for deliveries. Our additional flexible orders can also be cancelled with no further payment, subject to periodic forfeitures of deposits paid to date, up to a maximum of   $28.9 million   in forfeitures. Each of these contracts are subject to ongoing negotiations and/or rejection as part of our reorganization process.

Consolidated Results Summary 
  For   the three and six months ended     October 31,    (In thousands of U.S. dollars)  

Consolidated Results of Operations  
  Revenue 
  Consolidated revenue for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016     decreased   by   $111.2 million   or   30.8%   and   $216.7 million   or   29.4%  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively.  Revenue decreased in both our Helicopter Services and Heli-One segments. The changes in external revenue in our two segments are explained below.  
    
  Helicopter Services 
  The total external revenue for Helicopter Services for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016     decreased   by   $96.5 million   or   29.7%   and   $195.1 million   or   29.3%  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively.  The significant reduction in global oil prices since mid-2014 has continued to have a negative impact on our results in the current year quarter and period as our customers reduced activity and capital spending, and in particular, reduced oil and gas exploration related activity. However, we have seen declines in revenues with both production and exploration customers. The key variances were as follows: 
             
    Contract completions and activity.   Revenues decreased by   $54.6 million   and   $101.9 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, due to contract completions, primarily in the North Sea, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Mozambique and Romania, for both production and exploration customers. In addition, there was a   $17.1 million   and   $41.1 million   decrease in revenue due to contract completions and reduced customer activity in Brazil and a net   $7.0 million   and   $12.2 million   decrease in revenue resulting from other activity changes, primarily in Norway and in Australia;  
                
    Contract modification.   Revenues decreased by   $16.1 million   and   $34.2 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. This was as a result of contract modifications with continuing oil and gas customers due to reductions in price and number of helicopters on contract, as our customers continue to implement cost reduction initiatives;  
                
    Foreign exchange.   There was a   $5.0 million   and   $12.0 million   decrease for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, related to the impact of foreign currency translation on our reported results, primarily in the North Sea due to the significant decline in the British Pound Sterling since June 2016. In addition, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currency groups in the current year period compared to the prior year period, which resulted in a decrease in reported U.S. dollar revenue amounts, where revenue was transacted primarily in the local currencies of our operations; and 
     
   55 

     Table of Contents  

Reimbursable revenue.   There was a   $4.5 million   and   $10.2 million   decrease in reimbursable revenue primarily due to lower flying activity for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. Reimbursable revenue includes customer reimbursement of fuel costs; offset by 
                
    New contracts.   There was a   $7.8 million   and   $16.5 million   increase in revenue for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , respectively, compared to the prior year quarter and period, primarily from new contract wins for oil and gas customers in the North Sea and Australia. 
     On April 29, 2016, one of our Airbus H225 helicopters was involved in an accident near the Flesland Airport in Bergen, Norway. Pending the outcome of the investigation, we have suspended, together with other operators, flying operations of the H225 helicopter. The Bankruptcy Court has approved rejection of all of our leased H225 fleet. We have substituted Sikorsky S92A and other aircraft types where appropriate to continue to serve our customers  needs in an effort to minimize the impact of the H225 suspension on our revenues.  
  Heli-One 
  Heli-One s external revenue for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016     decreased   by   $14.7 million  , or   40.9%  , and   $21.6 million  , or   30.3%  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. Revenue decreased by   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, due to the impact of foreign exchange, primarily as a consequence of the strengthening U.S. dollar.  PBH revenue for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   decreased by   $8.6 million   and   $10.8 million   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, primarily due to lower levels of flight hours and exchanges. MRO revenue for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   decreased by   $5.9 million   and   $10.3 million   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively due to the timing of maintenance events and decreased repair work. 
   
  Direct Costs 
  For   the three and six months ended     October 31,    (In thousands of U.S. dollars)  

Direct costs, which exclude helicopter lease and associated costs, for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016     decreased   by   $30.4 million   and   $86.3 million   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The decrease in direct costs was a result of both foreign exchange translation, due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, and our active management of costs due to changes in customer activity. The primary factors which impacted direct costs were as follows: 
             
    Crew costs, which include salaries, benefits, training and recruitment costs,   decreased   by   $12.9 million   and   $30.6 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively.  The decrease in crew costs was partially due to the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which decreased crew costs by   $0.8 million   and   $3.6 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The remaining decrease was as a result of lower crew requirements due to reduced activity, contract completions and cost saving initiatives, primarily in the North Sea, Brazil, Australia, Canada and several African countries. Crew costs were incurred only by our Helicopter Services segment. 
                
    Base operations and other costs, which include our base operations, reimbursable costs, insurance costs and other external expenses,   decreased   by   $10.0 million   and   $26.3 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively.  This included an approximate   $0.2 million   and   $1.6 million   decrease related to the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively.  There was a decrease of   $4.1 million   and   $9.4 million   in rechargeable costs to customers, primarily due to lower flying hours, compared to the prior year quarter and

     Table of Contents  

period. Contract completions and reductions in activity, primarily in Africa, Brazil, Australia and the North Sea, in addition to the wind down of our operations in Nigeria, reduced costs by   $5.7 million   and   $15.3 million   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. Base operations and other costs were incurred only by our Helicopter Services segment.     
             
    Maintenance costs   decreased   by   $3.3 million   and   $19.5 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively due to a combination of reduced activity, suspension of H225 helicopters, and the timing of maintenance events. Maintenance costs include those related to repairs for owned and leased major components, spares and rotable and repairable parts, which are recognized when the costs are incurred. Our costs therefore can vary with the timing of the maintenance activity. A portion of our maintenance costs are externally subcontracted on a PBH basis and vary with flight hours, which were primarily incurred for our H225 aircraft in the prior year quarter and period. 
                
    Support costs   decreased   by   $4.2 million   and   $9.9 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, due to a combination of foreign exchange translation, reduced headcount and lower levels of base support, driven by our cost saving initiatives and lower activity levels. The majority of support costs were incurred by our Helicopter Services segment, with   $3.8 million   and   $7.2 million   related to our Heli-One segment. 
     Helicopter Lease and Associated Costs 
    Helicopter lease and associated costs   decreased   by   $27.6 million   and   $39.0 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the Bankruptcy Court approving the rejection of   71   helicopter leases during the current year period. We recorded lease expense on the rejected leases until the effective date of the lease rejection, the majority of which were June 30, 2016. See  Overview of Business - Voluntary Filing under Chapter 11  included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. In addition, helicopter lease costs decreased due to the reclassification of certain operating leases to capital leases, due to the modification of the lease agreements, during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. 
  Earnings from Equity Accounted Investees 
  Earnings from equity accounted investees   increased   by   $10.8 million   and   $9.6 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively.  This was primarily due to the gain on sale of our 29.9% interest in the ordinary shares of TAS of   $11.8 million  , which completed in October 2016.  See   note 3(b)(i)   of our interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
  General and Administration Costs 
  General and administration costs   decreased   by   $5.3 million   and   $6.3 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, professional, legal and consulting costs. 
  Depreciation  
  Depreciation expense   increased   by   $6.6 million   and   $2.0 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to helicopter acquisitions during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, accelerated depreciation on certain aircraft we plan to abandon, additional capital leases due to the modification of certain existing operating lease agreements during fiscal 2016, and an increase in the depreciation rates of our rotable and repairable assets. This was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation on certain aircraft in connection with our restructuring program in the first quarter of the prior year period and rejected capital leased helicopters during the current year period.  
  Restructuring Recovery (Expense) 
  We are undergoing a comprehensive review of our operations, organizational structure and fleet with the view of reducing operating costs. During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015  , we incurred restructuring expenses of   $16.2 million   and   $35.6 million   related to lease and other contractual costs on leased helicopters which we had ceased to use in our operations, employee severance costs and other associated costs. During the three months ended   October 31, 2016  , we had  
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

restructuring recovery of   $2.4 million   and an insignificant recovery in the six months ended   October 31, 2016  .  The recoveries in the current year period primarily relate to adjustments to the provision for leased helicopters.  All restructuring amounts related to leased aircraft have either been charged to reorganization items, net, as these have been approved for rejection by the Bankruptcy Court or adjusted to restructuring expense, as we have re-evaluated our assessment that we have permanently ceased use of these leased helicopters due to changes in our fleet plans. See   note 4   of our interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.  
  Asset Impairments 
  During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015  , we recorded an impairment charge of   $10.5 million   to increase our provision for obsolete and excess inventories on certain consumable inventories. This impairment charge resulted from the identification of consumable inventories that were in excess of our requirements. This was driven primarily by the significant and longer than initially expected decline in the price of oil and gas, which impacts our view of future utilization of these parts and resulting changes to our fleet and inventory management strategies. Excess consumable inventories have been measured at estimated market value, based on our experience with sales of surplus consumable inventories and our assessment of resale market conditions. During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , we recorded an impairment charge of   $2.7 million   to write-down the carrying value of   one   H155 helicopter to its fair value. 
  Interest on Debt Obligations 
  Interest on debt obligations   decreased   by   $20.4 million   and   $38.8 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. We ceased recognition of interest expense on the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility effective from the Petition Date. This was partially offset by an increase in interest costs on our revolving credit facility, due to the higher balance on this obligation compared to the prior year period.  
  Foreign Exchange Loss 
  The foreign exchange loss for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   increased by   $21.1 million   and   $29.5 million   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, primarily due to the significant decline in the British Pound Sterling since June 2016. This caused a loss in U.S. functional currency entities with British Pound Sterling denominated net monetary asset positions. In both the prior year period and the current year period, there was a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies, which caused a loss in both U.S. functional currency entities with foreign denominated net monetary asset positions and in Norwegian and Australian functional currency entities with net liability positions denominated in U.S. dollars.   
  Other Financing Income (Charges)   

  Other financing income (charges) decreased by   $12.9 million   and   $15.5 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, primarily due to a   $3.1 million   and   $17.8 million   gain on debt extinguishment transactions for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015  , due to the repurchase of   $40.6 million   of our senior unsecured notes on the open market at prices ranging from   50.50%   to   55.25%   of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest of   $0.5 million  . In addition, the net gain on fair value of foreign currency embedded derivatives  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

decreased by   $11.2 million   and   $16.1 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period, due to foreign currency movements compared to the prior year period.  This was partially offset by a   $15.1 million   net loss on fair value of foreign currency forward contracts in the prior year period. All of our foreign currency forward contract arrangements were terminated due to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions. The balance of the change was due to banking fees, amortization expense on residual value guarantees and deferred financing costs, and other charges.  
  Reorganization Items, Net 
  We have used the classification  Reorganization items, net  to reflect expenses and gains and losses that are the direct result of the reorganization of our business.  Reorganization items, net, is comprised as follows:     

  During   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , we recognized   $50.5 million   and   $835.9 million   of reorganization items, respectively. During   the three months ended     October 31, 2016  , we have expensed   $3.9 million   primarily related to the deferred financing costs on our revolving credit facility.   For the six months ended     October 31, 2016  , we expensed   $30.9 million   related to the deferred financing costs and unamortized net discount on our senior secured notes, senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility, and ABL Facility.  
  As of   October 31, 2016  , the Bankruptcy Court had approved   71   helicopter lease rejections. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded the expected allowed claim from the lessors on approval of the lease rejections and adjustments to lease related assets and liabilities which total   $740.0 million  . Our estimate of the expected amount of the allowed claim is a significant estimate. As the estimation process is inherently uncertain, future actions and decisions by the Bankruptcy Court may differ significantly from our own estimate, potentially having material future effects on our financial statements. Furthermore, these liabilities are reported as the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. There may be significant variation between the settled amount and the expected amount of the allowed claim. The lessors  rights of enforcement for those claims will be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.       
  Adjustments to other allowed claims include the loss on the settlement of our Canadian Supplemental Retirement Plan with certain plan participants of   $13.0 million   and   $4.0 million   adjustment of our terminated foreign currency forward contracts to the expected amount of the allowed claim.  In addition, we incurred professional fees related to advisors assisting us with the Chapter 11 proceedings. See   note 10   of our interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense   increased   by   $7.2 million   and   $1.4 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The effective tax rates were   (10.4)%   and   (12.5)%   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015   compared to   (9.4)%   and   (1.2)%   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , respectively. The increase in income tax expense during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period was primarily due to withholding tax on the sale of our 29.9% interest in the ordinary shares of TAS.  This was partially offset by a reduction in customer contract activity in Africa, where we are subject to branch and withholding taxes, lower levels of taxes in other foreign jurisdictions and a net reduction in uncertain tax positions compared to the prior year quarter and period.  
  The effective tax rate is the ratio of income tax expense to loss before income tax. Our effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as the amount of income (loss) in each tax jurisdiction, tax regulations governing each jurisdiction, non-tax deductible expenses incurred as a percentage of pre-tax income, valuation allowances taken on losses in certain jurisdictions and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. As a result, the increase or decrease in loss before  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

income tax will not have a significant impact on the income tax expense. The income tax expense is primarily comprised of withholding taxes as applicable and current income taxes in certain taxable jurisdictions. 
  Non-Controlling Interests 
  Net earnings allocated to non-controlling interests decreased by   $4.4 million   and   $11.6 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016   compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, due to the results of EHOB. This was primarily driven by reduced revenue as a result of contract completions and lower gains on embedded derivatives, partially offset by lower direct and helicopter lease costs. For further details on EHOB, see   note 3(a)(i)   of our interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Segmented Results of Operations 
  Helicopter Services 
    
  For   the three and six months ended     October 31,    (In thousands of U.S. dollars)  

Helicopter Services Adjusted EBITDAR   decreased   by   $64.7 million   and   $110.3 million   and Adjusted EBITDAR margin   decreased   by   11.5%   and   7.9%   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The primary factors that impacted Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR margin for Helicopter Services compared to the prior year quarter and period were as follows: 
             
    The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR margin was substantially due to contract completions and contract modifications reflecting changes in customer requirements and reduced flying activity across all regions.  This was partially offset by small contract wins in the North Sea and Australia and cost savings through lower activity, reductions in headcount, lower maintenance costs and other cost saving initiatives; and 
                
    Earnings from equity accounted investees increased Adjusted EBITDAR by   $10.8 million   and   $9.6 million   and Adjusted EBITDAR margin by   1.9%   and   0.7%   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively, primarily as a result of the sale of our 29.9% interest in the ordinary shares of TAS in October 2016; and 
                
    The balance of the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR margin compared to the prior year quarter and period was primarily related to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our reported results. The U.S. dollar strengthened against most currency groups in the current year period compared to the prior year period, which resulted in a decrease in reported U.S. dollar Adjusted EBITDAR amounts in these regions, where activities were transacted primarily in the local currencies of our operations.  The majority of the impact of foreign exchange translation resulted from the North Sea due to the significant decline in the British Pound Sterling since June 2016.

Heli-One 
  For   the three and six months ended     October 31,    (In thousands of U.S. dollars)  

Heli-One s Adjusted EBITDAR   decreased   by   $7.1 million   and   $12.9 million   and Adjusted EBITDAR margin   decreased   by   13.7%   and   11.0%   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively. The primary changes for Heli-One compared to the prior year quarter and period were as follows: 
             
    An increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased Adjusted EBITDAR by   $3.3 million   and   $4.0 million   and Adjusted EBITDAR margin by   6.4%   and   3.4%   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year quarter and period respectively; and 
                
    Lower levels of external third-party PBH and MRO revenue and internal revenue with our Helicopter Services segment due to contract completions, reduction in flying activity and suspension of H225 aircraft, partially offset by cost control efforts and timing of maintenance costs. 

Financial Condition and Sources of Liquidity  
  Analysis of Historical Cash Flows 
  For the six months ended     October 31,    (In thousands of U.S. dollars)  

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016   was   $31.2 million  , an increase of   $58.1 million   compared to the prior year period. Operating cash flows in the current year period benefited from the effects of the Bankruptcy Petitions filed by the Debtors, as we ceased interest payments on our debt obligations and the majority of any pre-petition liabilities of Debtors were not paid. As a result, changes in working capital contributed   $70.3 million   to operating cash flows in the current year period compared to only   $11.1 million   in the prior year period. In the current year period, we substantially reduced payments on our helicopter operating leases due to approved lease rejections; however, the cash benefit was offset by increased cash outflows to professionals assisting with our bankruptcy process.  
  No assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce operational cash requirements will be effective. The business may not generate sufficient net cash from operating activities and we may not be able to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the

  Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities  
  Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities is driven by changes to debt obligations, including the impact of deferred financing costs, and accounts receivable securitization.  
  In the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016  , cash used in financing activities was   $23.8 million  ,   $21.6 million   of which was due to the discontinuation of the accounts receivable securitization arrangement and   $2.2 million   due to payments on certain capital lease obligations.  
  In the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  , the   $92.0 million   provided by financing activities was due to   $8.3 million   sold interest in accounts receivable under our securitization arrangement and   $110.7 million   net proceeds on the revolving credit facility and capital lease and other repayments, partially offset by   $22.1 million   on the repurchase by one of our subsidiaries of   $40.6 million   of the senior unsecured notes on the open market at prices ranging from   50.50%   to   55.25%   of the principal during July and August 2015, and   $4.9 million   of deferred financing costs incurred related to the ABL Facility.  
  Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities  
  Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities is primarily attributable to property and equipment additions and disposals, helicopter deposits net of lease inception refunds, restricted cash, and proceeds from the sale of investments.  
  In the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016  , our focus was to actively reduce our fleet to align with the reduction in customer demand. Therefore, we had a substantial decline in the level of capital investment in aircraft in the current year period.  The   $18.4 million   provided by investing activities was primarily due to   $35.5 million   received from the sale of our 29.9% interest in the ordinary shares of TAS in October 2016. In addition, we received   $1.8 million   in proceeds from property and equipment disposals and there was an   $8.5 million   decrease in restricted cash, primarily due to the discontinuation of our accounts receivable securitization arrangement. This was partially offset by   $27.5 million   of property and equipment additions, primarily related to rotable and repairable parts. 
  In the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  , the   $119.8 million   used in investing activities was due to   $107.0 million   property and equipment additions,   $32.6 million   helicopter deposits net of lease inception refunds and an   $8.7 million   increase in restricted cash, primarily related to the timing of cash flows on our accounts receivable securitization arrangement, partially offset by   $28.5 million   proceeds from property and equipment disposals, the majority of which related to proceeds on helicopter sale and leaseback transactions. 

Liquidity and Sources of Liquidity 
  Liquidity  
  As of   April 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2016  , our liquidity totaled   $266.1 million   and   $287.7 million  , respectively.  Our liquidity as of   April 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2016   was comprised only of cash and cash equivalents. Due to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases we had no further borrowing capacity as at   October 31, 2016  .  
  Pending the outcome of the Bankruptcy Cases and upon emergence from bankruptcy, we expect that our primary sources of liquidity will continue to be cash on hand and cash flows from operations. In addition to the cash requirements to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred and continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation and handling of the Bankruptcy Cases. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs for the duration of the Bankruptcy Cases. 
  Pre-Petition Sources of Liquidity   
  On May 5, 2016, the Debtors filed Petitions seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code, which constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the senior secured notes, senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility.  In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations   and based on our Plan  ,   the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility, the ABL Facility and all of our capital lease obligations were reclassified as liabilities subject to compromise. We have ceased recognition of interest expense on the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

notes, and the ABL Facility from the Petition Date. The aggregate contractual interest due under the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility was   $27.3 million   and   $54.8 million   for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  , respectively.  All deferred financing costs on the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility, and the ABL Facility were charged to reorganization items, net, during the   six months ended     October 31, 2016  . See   note 9  ,   note 10   and   note 11   of our interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and note 14 of our audited annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

Future Cash Requirements  
  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 includes disclosures of our contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements as of April 30, 2016. There have been no material changes during the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016   from the information disclosed in  Item 7. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016, except as noted below.  
  Operating Lease Commitments  
  We have helicopter operating leases in respect of   86   helicopters included in our fleet as of   October 31, 2016  . As at   October 31, 2016  , these leases had expiry dates ranging from fiscal   2017   to   2025  .  For those helicopters where we have an unexercised option to purchase them for agreed amounts, the purchase options do not constitute bargain purchase options and we do not have a commitment to exercise the options.  
  In addition to helicopter operating leases, we had operating lease commitments as of   October 31, 2016   for buildings, land and other equipment with minimum lease payments of   $65.3 million   and expiry dates ranging from fiscal   2017   to fiscal   2079  . 
  As a result of the May 5, 2016 filing of the Petitions by the Debtors in the Bankruptcy Court, all of our helicopter lease financing agreements were in default subsequent to April 30, 2016.  
  The lease obligations as at   October 31, 2016   reflect changes to our commitments related to   71   helicopter lease rejections approved by the Bankruptcy Court during the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016  . The remaining filed motions to reject certain additional helicopter leases with the Bankruptcy Court and any other subsequent motions may substantially alter our remaining minimum lease rentals. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have recorded the expected allowed claim from the lessors on approval of the lease rejection, with the rights of enforcement for those claims subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.     The approved helicopter lease rejections have reduced our minimum lease rentals by approximately   $640.0 million  . This reduction in minimal lease rentals does not reflect the reduction in lease obligations as a result of Bankruptcy Court approved interim lease arrangements, with final lease terms subject to agreement with the respective lessors and approval by the Bankruptcy Court. 
  New Helicopter Commitments 
  As at   October 31, 2016  , we have a total commitment of   $236.8 million   for the purchase of new helicopters, for which we have contractual commitments to pay in fiscal   2017   (  $170.6 million  ) and   2018   (  $66.2 million  ). We also have additional flexible orders of   $247.5 million   which allow us to monitor the market recovery before confirming dates and the type of aircraft for deliveries. Our additional flexible orders can also be cancelled with no further payment, subject to periodic forfeitures of deposits paid to date, up to a maximum of   $28.9 million   in forfeitures. Each of these contracts are subject to ongoing negotiations and/or rejection as part of our reorganization process. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company has variable interests in entities that are not consolidated, as we are not the primary beneficiary, which provide operating lease financing to us, and an entity that provides flying services to third-party customers. At   October 31, 2016  , we had operating leases for   70   helicopters with variable interest entities that were not consolidated. See   note 3(b)(ii)   of the interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Guarantees 
  The Company has provided limited guarantees to third parties under some of its operating leases relating to a portion of the residual helicopter values at the termination of the leases. The leases have terms expiring between fiscal   2017   and   2024  . At   October 31, 2016  , the Company s exposure under the asset value guarantees including guarantees in the form of funded and unfunded residual value guarantees is approximately   $10.8 million  .  
  Contingencies 
  We have exposure for certain legal matters as disclosed in   note 18   to the interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in our exposure to contingencies. 
  We have entered into fee arrangements with financial advisors to assist us with our Bankruptcy filing. The arrangements include contingent fee payments up to   $14.2 million   payable upon completion of Chapter 11 reorganization. At   October 31, 2016  , no contingent fee amounts were accrued.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.  
  In connection with the Chapter 11 proceedings, transactions and events directly associated with the reorganization are required, under the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , to be separately disclosed and distinguished from those of the ongoing operations of the business. We have used the classification  Reorganization items, net  on the consolidated statements of operations to reflect expenses, gains and losses that are the direct result of the reorganization of our business. See   note 10   in the interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.  
  As a result of the Petitions filed by the Debtors seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code on May 5, 2016 and based on our Plan, our pre-petition liabilities, including our obligations under the senior secured notes, senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility, were classified as subject to compromise based on our assessment of these obligations following the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  . Pre-petition liabilities subject to compromise are required to be reported at the amount expected to be allowed, regardless of whether they may be settled for lesser amounts and remain subject to future adjustments based on negotiated settlements with claimants, actions of the Bankruptcy Court, rejection of executory contracts, proofs of claims or other events.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  See   note 2   in the interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.  
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Not applicable. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of   October 31, 2016  . Based upon this evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 31, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   October 31, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  One or more of our subsidiaries are, from time to time, named as defendants in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business as discussed and previously reported in  Item 3. Legal Proceedings  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Developments in these previously reported ongoing matters, if any, are described in   note 18   to the interim financial statements for   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2015 and 2016   included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item. Our business faces many risks. However, for a detailed discussion of the risk factors that should be understood by any investor contemplating investment in our ordinary shares, please refer to the section titled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. There have been no material changes in the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 other than those set forth below.  
    
  The PSA is subject to termination upon the occurrence of a number of termination events. 
    
  The PSA may be terminated upon the occurrence of a number of termination events (each, a  Plan Support Agreement Termination Event ) as more specifically set forth in the PSA.  If a Plan Support Agreement Termination Event occurs and the PSA is terminated, all obligations of the parties to the PSA shall terminate (except as specifically provided in the PSA). 
    
                  Furthermore, upon termination of the PSA, any party to the PSA shall have all the rights and remedies that it would have had and shall be entitled to take all actions that it would have been entitled to take if it not entered into the Plan Support Agreement, and none of its rights or remedies shall be deemed waived pursuant to a claim of laches or estoppel.  Without the commitment provided by the Consenting Creditor Parties to vote in favor of the Plan, the Debtors may not be able to secure sufficient votes in favor of the Plan for confirmation. 
    
  The Bankruptcy Court may not confirm the Plan.  
    
                  Although the Company believes that the Plan will satisfy all requirements necessary for confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion. 
    
                  The Bankruptcy Code requires that a plan of reorganization comply with certain requirements (including, but not limited to, the requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code) for a plan of reorganization to be confirmed.  The Bankruptcy Court may determine that one or more of those requirements is not satisfied with respect to the Plan.  If the Bankruptcy Court were to make such a determination, the Debtors could be required to restart the solicitation process.  In such a situation, the Debtors could be required to (i) seek approval of a new disclosure statement, (ii) solicit or re-solicit votes from holders of Claims and/or Interests (as defined in the Plan), as applicable, and/or (iii) seek confirmation of the newly-proposed plan of reorganization. 
    
                  Further, denial of confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court could give rise to a right of the Consenting Creditor Parties to terminate the PSA.  If such a termination were to occur, the Debtors  efforts to reorganize would be delayed and possibly jeopardized.  Additionally, should the Plan fail to be approved, confirmed, or consummated, non-Debtor parties-in-interest may file alternative plans of reorganization pursuant to section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the Debtors would be responsible for paying the Put Option Premium in cash. 
    
  If the Effective Date does not occur by March 17, 2017, a Plan Support Agreement Termination Event will occur, which would result in the Debtors  payment of the Put Option Premium in cash. 
    
                  Although the Company believes that the Effective Date (as defined in the Plan) will occur soon after the date on which the Bankruptcy Court enters its order confirming the Plan, there can be no assurance as to the timing of the Effective Date.  If the conditions precedent to the Effective Date set forth in the Plan have not occurred or have not been waived as set forth in Article IX of the Plan, then the Bankruptcy Court s confirmation order may be vacated, in which event no distributions would be made under the Plan, the Debtors and all holders of Claims or Interests would be restored to the status quo as of the  
  
   65 

     Table of Contents  

day immediately preceding the date of the confirmation order, and the Debtors  obligations with respect to Claims and Interests would remain unchanged.  It is a termination event under the PSA if the Effective Date does not occur by March 17, 2017, and such termination would result in the Debtors  payment of the Put Option Premium in cash. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  None.  

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES  
  The Petitions filed by the Debtors seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes, the revolving credit facility and the ABL Facility. As of the Petition Date, certain of the Debtors pre-petition liabilities, including the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility, were classified as liabilities subject to compromise. During the three months ended October 31, 2016, we reclassified the revolving credit facility as a liability subject to compromise based on our Plan.  Following the guidance of ASC 852   Reorganizations  , we have expensed   $3.9 million   and   $30.9 million   related to the deferred financing costs and unamortized net discount on these obligations during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  . We ceased recognition of interest expense on the senior secured notes, the senior unsecured notes and the ABL Facility, from the Petition Date during   the three and six months ended     October 31, 2016  .  We continued recognition of interest expense on the revolving credit facility in accordance with the Plan. 
    
                      Pursuant to the terms of our preferred shares, which rank senior to our ordinary shares, we are required to pay regular cash dividends or issue shares in respect of amounts accrued as dividends on the preferred shares quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. We are currently unable to pay such obligations while we are in Chapter 11 proceedings and are not likely to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, resulting in the dividend rate increase to 11.5% per annum until such time as all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid in full. In addition, the holders of our preferred shares have certain redemption rights, including upon certain change in control events involving us, which, if exercised, could require us to repurchase all of the outstanding preferred shares at the original purchase price of the preferred shares plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.
