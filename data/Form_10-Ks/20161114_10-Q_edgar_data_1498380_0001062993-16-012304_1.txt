Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.    Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016
   (Unaudited)    
  Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Going Concern   
 Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc. ( ODT  or the  Company )
was incorporated on November 16, 2009 in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. The Company
was in the business of operating websites with advertising revenue platforms.
However, as described below, the Company changed its primary business focus to
the development and commercialization of a biotechnology platform. The Company
has limited operations and has had no revenues from inception to date. The
Company has a December 31 year-end.  
 Effective March 24, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the
issued and outstanding shares of RelationshipScoreboard.com Entertainment Inc.
( RS  or  RelationshipScoreboard.com ), a company incorporated on November 16,
2009 in the state of Nevada, U.S.A. in exchange for 16,000,000 shares of the
Company s common stock. Upon the completion of the acquisition, the former sole
shareholder of RS held 89% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock.
As a result, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse takeover transaction
( RTO ) for accounting purpose, as RS was deemed to be the acquirer, and these
consolidated financial statements are a continuation of the financial statements
of RS. On January 28, 2013, RelationshipScoreboard.com was closed and dissolved.
The Company sold the website assets for $10 to an arm s length individual and
wrote off all supplier payables in the amount of $430.  
 On April 23, 2012, the Company established an Israeli
subsidiary named Savicell Diagnostic Ltd. ( Savicell ) with the intention of
exploring business ventures in the biotechnology sector. On July 25, 2012,
Savicell entered into a definitive licensing agreement with a division of Tel
Aviv University for the purpose of developing and commercializing a new
technology relative to the early detection of various forms of disease. With the
consummation of this transaction, the Company is now entirely focused on its
biotechnology efforts.  
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared with
the ongoing assumption that the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
positive working capital of $386,579 as at September 30, 2016 (December 31, 2015
  $1,104,876) and an accumulated deficit of $9,483,096. Furthermore, additional
future losses are anticipated which raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.  
 The operations of the Company have primarily been funded by the
sale of common shares and loans received. Continued operations of the Company
are dependent on the Company s ability to complete equity financings or to
generate profitable operations in the future. Management s plan in this regard
is to secure additional funds through future equity financings. Such financings
may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms to the Company.
Failure to obtain the ongoing support of its equity financings and creditors may
make the going concern basis of accounting inappropriate, in which case the
Company s assets and liabilities would need to be recognized at their
liquidation values. These consolidation financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets
amounts and classification of liabilities that might arise from this
uncertainty.  

Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.    Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016
   (Unaudited)    
  Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies   
  a)        Basis of
Presentation   These consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America ( US GAAP ) and are expressed in United Stated dollars, unless
otherwise noted.  
 These interim consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and
should be read in conjunction with those annual consolidated financial
statements filed for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of
management, these interim consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments for a fair
presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative
of results for the full year. 
 For further information, refer to the Company s consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto filed on April 14, 2016 for the year
ended December 31, 2015.  
  b)        Principles of
Consolidation   These interim consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its 85.78% (December 31, 2015-77.00%; September
30, 2015-75.02%) interest in Savicell. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  
  c)        Use of
Estimates   The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates
include assumptions and estimates relating to share-based payments, valuation
allowances for deferred income tax assets and determination of useful lives of
property, plant and equipment.  
  d)        Foreign
Currency Translation   The Company s functional currency is the U.S.
dollar. Transactions in other currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the
rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at
rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Exchange gains and
losses are recorded in the statements of operations. 
 The Company s subsidiary s functional currency is the New
Israeli Shekel ( NIS ). All transactions are recorded in NIS. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in NIS are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of
exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates and expenses are translated at the
average exchange rates. Gains and losses from such translations are included in
stockholders  equity, as a component of other comprehensive income.  

Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.    Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016
   (Unaudited)    
  Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
  
  d)        Foreign
Currency Translation (cont d)  
 In the year ended 2013, Savicell s functional currency was the
U.S. dollar. During the year 2014, with the increased volume of transactions in
the local currency, management reassessed Savicell s functional currency to NIS based on the change in
facts and effective as of January 1, 2014. Such change is still appropriate in
year 2016. 
 As a result of the functional currency change discussed above,
a cumulative translation adjustment of $4,787 is included in accumulated other
comprehensive income and will only be adjusted in the event of a full or partial
disposition of the Company's investment in Savicell.  
  e)        Cash and Cash
Equivalents   Cash consist entirely of readily available cash balances.
There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
  f)         
  Stock-based Compensation   The Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock
Compensation ( ASC 718 ). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as
expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values.
For stock options granted to employees and to members of the Board of Directors
for their services on the Board of Directors, the Company estimates the grant
date fair value of each option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management to
make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected
volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option,
risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock. 
 Share-based payments issued to non-employees are recorded at
their fair values at each reporting date, as the equity instruments vest and are
recognized as expense over the related service period in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 718 and ASC Topic 505, Equity. For equity instruments granted
to non-employees, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a
straight-line basis.  
  g)        Income
Taxes   Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the amounts reported in the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted income tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized or the
liability is settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred tax
liabilities and assets is recognized in income in the period in which the change
occurs. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that they are
considered more likely than not to be realized.  
 Per FASB ASC 740  Income taxes  under the liability method, it
is the Company s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related
interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax
benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax
authorities. At September 30, 2016, the Company believes it has appropriately
accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the Company prevails
in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized benefit is established or
is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company s effective
tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. Interest and
penalties associated with the Company s tax positions are recorded as Interest
Expense. 

Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.    Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016
   (Unaudited)    
  Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
  h)        Comprehensive
Income (Loss)   The Company accounts for comprehensive income under the
provisions of ASC Topic 220-10, Comprehensive Income - Overall, which
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its
components and accumulated balances. The Company is disclosing this information
on its Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
  i)        Earnings (Loss)
Per Share   Basic loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  
 Diluted loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive securities outstanding. Stock
options are considered to be common stock equivalents and were not included in
the net loss per share calculation for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 because the inclusion of such underlying shares would have had an
anti-dilutive effect.  
  j)        Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments   Fair Value of
Financial Instruments   the Company adopted SFAS ASC 820-10-50,  Fair Value
Measurements . This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level
valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances
disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as
follows:  

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted
      prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include
      quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and
      inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
      indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable
      and significant to the fair measurement.     
 As at September 30, 2016, the fair value of cash and restricted
cash measured using Level 1 inputs.  
 The Company s financial instruments are cash, restricted cash,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities and convertible debentures. The
recorded values of cash and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
their fair values based on their short-term nature. The Company believes the
recorded values of convertible debentures, net of the discount, approximate the
fair value as the interest rate (stated or effective) approximates market rates
for similar types of instruments. 
  k)        Research and
Development Costs  In 2016, all research and development costs are charged
to expense as incurred. The majority of these cost are in house expenses related
to consulting fees, materials and legal expenses related to patents. Savicell s
financing commitment related to the License and Research Funding Agreement (as
defined in Note 4 below) entered into with Ramot at Tel Aviv University was
completely fulfilled by December 31, 2015.  

Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.    Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016
   (Unaudited)    
  Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
  l)        Fixed Assets
  Property and Equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over
their estimated useful life of 3-15 years on a straight line basis. 
  m)        Convertible
debentures   Convertible debentures, for which the embedded conversion
feature does not qualify for derivative treatment, are evaluated to determine if
the effective or actual rate of conversion per the terms of the convertible note
agreement is below market value. In these instances, the Company accounts for
the value of the beneficial conversion feature as a debt discount, which is then
accreted to interest expense over the life of the related debt using the
effective interest method.  
  n)        Modifications
to debt   The Company evaluates any modifications to its debt in
accordance with the applicable guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt-Modifications and
Extinguishments. If the debt instruments are substantially modified, the
modification is accounted for in the same manner as a debt extinguishment (i.e.,
a major modification) and the fees paid are recognized as expense at the time of
the modification. Otherwise, such fees are deferred and amortized as an
adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the modified debt
instrument using the interest method.  
  o)        Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU
2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide
That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.
The standard provides guidance that a performance target that affects vesting of
a share-based payment and that could be achieved after the requisite service
condition is a performance condition. As a result, the target is not reflected
in the estimation of the award's grant date fair value. Share-based compensation
cost for such award would be recognized over the required service period, if it
is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. ASU 2014-12 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early
adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis to
awards that are granted or modified on or after the effective date of the
standard. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of
this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's interim
consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
 In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income
Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income
Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items, which
eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. Under this new guidance, entities
will no longer be required to separately classify, present and disclose
extraordinary events and transactions. The amendments in this update are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The
Company adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this
pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's interim
consolidated financial position or results of operations.  

Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.    Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016
   (Unaudited)    
  Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,
"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis"("ASU
2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 makes several modifications to the consolidation guidance
for variable interest entities ("VIEs") and general partners' investments in
limited partnerships, as well as modifications to the evaluation of whether
limited partnerships are VIEs or voting interest entities. It is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption
of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's interim
consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
 In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). In August 2015, FASB issued
ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs
Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU 2015-15 ). ASU 2015-03 will
require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a
deduction from the carrying amount of the debt. ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to
present debt issuance costs associated with a revolving line of credit
arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. The
recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by
ASU 2015-03 or ASU 2015-15. These ASU s are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that
reporting period, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-03 will require the
Company to reclassify its deferred financing costs associated with its long-term
debt from other assets to long-term debt on a retrospective basis. The new
standard will not affect the Company s results of operations or cash flows. The
Company adopted ASU 2015-15 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(ASU 2014-09). This accounting standard supersedes all existing US GAAP revenue
recognition guidance. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when
it transfers the control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration which the company expects to collect in exchange
for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will require additional disclosures in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is effective for annual
and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is
evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 and an estimate of the impact to the
interim consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time. 
 On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation
  Stock Compensation. The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for
employee share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public
business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption will be
permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of
the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  
 The Company is evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on
its interim consolidated financial statements.

 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of
Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU
provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose
going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard
requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance
of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which
the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further,
an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about
the entity's ability to continue as a going concern."  
 The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December
15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter and early adoption is permitted. The
Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-15 and an estimate of the impact to
the interim consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time.

 As of September 30, 2016, the fixed assets balance on the
financial statement consist of the following:  
 
  Note 4   License and Research Funding Agreement   
 On July 25, 2012, the Company s subsidiary Savicell entered
into a License and Research Funding Agreement ( R D Agreement ) with Ramot
at Tel Aviv University ( Ramot ) pursuant to which:  
 
   In the course of research performed at Tel-Aviv University (" TAU "),
  Prof. Fernando Patolsky has developed technology relating to early detection
  of diseases by measuring metabolic activity in the immune system;
   Savicell wishes to fund further research at TAU relating to such
  technology; and
   Savicell wishes to obtain a license from Ramot with respect to such
  technology and the results of such further funded research in order to develop
  and commercialize products in the diagnostics space, and Ramot wishes to grant
  the Company such license, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of
  this R D Agreement.   
 Pursuant to the above noted R D Agreement, Savicell will
fund research expenditures amounting to a total of $1,600,000 according to the
following schedule:  
 
   $81,000 within 5 business days of the R D Agreement (paid)
   Before October 2012; $359,500 plus VAT as applicable (paid)
   Before January 3, 2013; $359,500 plus VAT as applicable (paid)
   Before April 3, 2013; $400,000 plus VAT as applicable (paid)
   Before July 3, 2013; $400,000 plus VAT as applicable (paid)   
 The payments originally due on April 3, 2013 and July 3, 2013
were postponed by the parties until such time as the funds were actually
required in furtherance of the joint research and development initiatives. As of
December 31, 2015, Savicell s entire financing commitment has been met and no
more expenditures are mandated by the R D Agreement on behalf of Ramot. Savicell
is continuing the clinical research within its own laboratory situated in Haifa,

(Continued)  
 In addition, Savicell issued to Ramot warrants (the  Warrants )
to purchase a number of ordinary shares of Savicell which together comprised 15%
of issued shares of Savicell on an as-converted, fully diluted basis (equivalent
to 1,765 Warrant Shares of Savicell). The Warrants are exercisable at an
exercise price equal to the par value of the Warrant Shares, at any time and
from time to time before Savicell completes a deemed liquidity event or the
first underwritten offering of the Savicell's ordinary shares to the general
public. The fair value of the Warrant Shares was estimated at $1,698.97 per
Warrant Share which is equivalent to the price at which Savicell has issued
shares to third parties, for a total of $2,998,682 which was included in
research and development costs. As the exercise price inherent in the warrant
certificate to purchase 1,765 common shares of Savicell is at nominal value, the
warrant certificate is valued at the price of the subsequent equity issuance by
Savicell ($1,698.97 per share) and the related common shares are considered to
be issued and outstanding.  
 Upon successful development and commercialization of the
technology, and in recognition of the rights and licenses granted to Savicell
pursuant to this R D Agreement, Savicell will be subject to (a) royalties
based on the worldwide sales related to the technology; and (b) minimum annual
royalties with respect to any calendar year following the first commercial sales
as follows. The minimum annual royalties are subject to increases for each
successive year. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Savicell
incurred $28,050 (2015 - $723,721) of expenses related to kits collaboration
with Ramot that have been included in research and development costs.  
  Note 5  Related Party Transactions   
 The Company completed the following related party transactions:
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
incurred consulting fees and salaries of $450,726 payable to its directors and
officers as well as a company controlled by a former director/officer.

accrued liabilities are amounts of $24,300 (December 31, 2015 - Nil) that was
payable to a company controlled by a former director/officer of the Company and
$121,842 (December 31, 2015-$16,325) that was payable to current officers or
directors of the Company.  
 On November 4, 2011, the Company entered into a loan Agreement
( Loan Agreement ) with a shareholder of the Company to settle a loan payable in
the amount of $74,062. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the terms of repayment
were amended to specify that ten per cent (10%) of the gross proceeds of any
prospective debt or equity financing undertaken by ODT would be applied to the
repayment of the principal of this loan until fully repaid. The term loan is
unsecured, non-interest bearing and requires that any balance remaining
outstanding on November 4, 2016 would then be fully due and payable.

second and third anniversaries of the date of grant provided the employee
remains an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. The options were valued
based on the Black Scholes model. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recorded stock based compensation of $3,485 for such options. 
 On June 6, 2016 the Company granted a total of 800,000 stock
options to a consultant. The stock options are exercisable at the exercise price
of $0.20 per share. 480,000 of the options so granted will vest as to one
quarter of such options at the end of each completed year that the consultant
provides the services. 
 The remaining 320,000 options will be fully vested when the
consultant has completed the provision of a minimum of 600 blood samples of lung
cancer and control patients during the 4 years following June 6, 2016. One
twelfth of these options will vest upon each 50 blood samples having been
delivered by the consultant   to the Company. The options were valued based
on the Black Scholes model. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company recorded stock based compensation of $9,814 for such options.  
 The fair value of each option grant is calculated using the
following assumptions:

Non-Controlling Interests   
 The Company s subsidiary, Savicell, granted a third party a
warrant certificate to purchase 1,765 common shares of Savicell that initially
represented 15% of the underlying common equity of Savicell. In the course of
its initial equity issuances up to October 30, 2012 (the  Initial Closing ),
Savicell issued a total of 592 ordinary shares at $1,698.97 per share to the
non-related third party representing approximately 4.79% of the fully diluted
common equity of Savicell for aggregate proceeds of $1,005,795. The Savicell
investors are entitled to convert their Savicell shares into common shares of
ODT at a price equal to 80% of the per share pricing of the first completed ODT
financing of over $500,000 conducted after July 1, 2012 (the  Financing Price )
provided that for purposes of such conversion, the deemed maximum Financing
Price shall be the per share price of the common shares of ODT based on (a) an
aggregate ODT equity valuation of $30,000,000; and (b) the number of common
shares of ODT outstanding at the time of the financing. Savicell continued its
equity issuances following the Initial Closing.  
 As at December 31, 2012, Savicell had issued a total of 684
shares at $1,698.97 per share representing approximately 5.11% of the fully
diluted common equity of Savicell for aggregate proceeds of $1,162,192.  
 During the year ended December 31, 2013, Savicell issued a
total of 760 shares at $1,700 per share representing approximately 5.68% of the

Corporate Overview    
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 16,
2009 under the name  Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc.  with authorized
capital of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per
share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per
share. On March 24, 2010, we entered into a share purchase agreement with
Benjamin Cherniak, whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares
of RelationshipScoreboard.com Entertainment, Inc. in consideration for the
issuance of 16,000,000 of our common shares. RSE was incorporated in the State
of Nevada on November 16, 2009. There were no related party interests in the
acquisition of RelationshipScoreboard.com Entertainment, Inc.  
 Pursuant to a license agreement and research funding agreement
(the   License Agreement  ) dated July 24, 2012 and entered into on July
25, 2012 executed by our Subsidiary and Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd.
(  Ramot  ), a private company incorporated in the State of Israel and
having a place of business at 5 Shenker Street, Herzliah, Israel, our Subsidiary
was granted a license to certain patented technology relating to the early
detection of diseases by measuring metabolic activity in the immune system (the
  Technology  ). The products (the   Products  ) means any instrument,
device, process, method, product, component, or system that contain or is based
on, in whole or in part, the Technology.  
 As consideration for the worldwide exclusive license of the
Products, our Subsidiary will pay, issue and fund the following to Ramot:  

(a)  
     
       a royalty (the   Royalty  ) on worldwide net sales
      of the Products by our company and its affiliates or
sublicensee;   

(b)  
     
       a minimum annual royalty, credited against the
      Royalty;   

(c)  
     
       percentages of all payments received in connection with a
      sublicense;   

(d)  
     
       issue warrants to purchase, for nominal consideration,
      the number of common shares of the Subsidiary such that Ramot holds a
      minority interest in the Subsidiary; and   

(e)  
     
       fund research expenditures for the research of the
      Technology.    
 After the entry into of the License Agreement, we are focused
on the development of Savicell.  
   Our Current Business    
 Savicell  
 The Savicell  platform is a blood test designed for the early
detection of disease. It is a broad platform with applications for cancer,
autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. While our focus initially is on
early diagnosis of disease, we believe our technology may have additional
applications in drug response monitoring for therapies that impact immune
response. Immunotherapy, both for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases, is an
example where metabolic shift profiles could indicate response to drug
treatment. 
 Initially, Savicell is focused on the multibillion-dollar
cancer diagnosis market. Savicell deploys Well-Shield  technology, a Liquid
ImmunoBiopsy  diagnostic platform. In contrast to existing technologies that
evaluate secretions of cancer cells, Well-Shield s ImmunoBiopsy platform
receives data directly from the immune system. Importantly, Well-Shield is
different in that it is a functional test measuring the metabolic activation
profile of the immune system as an indicator of disease status. As an immune
system test, it is inherently suited for early detection. 
 6  

The technology has now received intellectual property
protection with a patent approved in the United States, China and Japan.
Furthermore, the patent process is ongoing in several other countries.  
 Disease intrusion and cell malformation, including cancer, are
first detected by the immune system, which energizes to rid the body of the
malignancy. The initial immune response to disease is intricate, deploying
different metabolic pathways and subtypes of cells. The Savicell Well-Shield 
technology is designed to detect and interpret these differential metabolic
responses. 
 The Savicell vision is to develop and commercialize a line of
patient-friendly blood tests that enable early diagnosis, staging, and
monitoring, thereby saving lives and ensuring appropriate treatment. Cancer is
our initial focus.  
  The need for early diagnosis   
 Cancer cases are increasing, with more than 20 million new
cases predicted in 2025, compared to 12 million in 2008. Early detection is very
important because it can improve outcomes. Typically, more treatment options are
available when cancer is diagnosed early, and survival improves. In the United
States, the five-year survival rate improves by at least four times with early
diagnosis and before cancer has spread. Unfortunately, to date, the majority of
cancer patients are diagnosed at later stages. 
 While surgical biopsies are the norm, they are invasive and
expensive. The need for simpler and more efficient processes for cancer
detection has incentivized some 38 companies in the United States to work on
creating liquid biopsies. In a 2015 report, investment bank Piper Jaffray valued
the potential market for liquid biopsies at $29 billion in the United States
alone.  

7  

Using technologies based on circulating tumor cells, exosomes,
and circulating tumor nucleic acids, liquid biopsy companies are making progress
in developing products that have advantages versus current technologies.
However, it appears more likely that these types of liquid biopsy technologies
best support late stage cancers, with technical challenges remaining for
early-stage cancers and early cancer screening. 
 In contrast, the Well-Shield patented ImmunoBiopsy platform is
unique in the Liquid Biopsy market. And we believe that as an immune system
functional test it is inherently better suited for early detection. 
  Product focus  
 Savicell conducted clinical work for tests specific to breast
and lung cancers in multiple medical centers. We had encouraging early reviews
of our breast cancer and lung cancer analyses albeit on relatively small sample
sizes. Specifically, we distinguished between breast cancer patients and healthy
donors, and lung cancer patients and healthy donors, with high sensitivity and
specificity of greater than 95% in both cancers. In addition, we were able to
show that there is a metabolic profile difference between other breast disease
donors and breast cancer donors and between COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease) donors and lung cancer donors. 
 Based on this early potential, Savicell has decided to focus
our resources on lung cancer as our lead product. We are working to increase the
population size of the lung cancer clinical test and continue to fine-tune a
predictive algorithm to identify lung cancer. Early results of this effort
generated promising cross-validation of 72 donors from our clinical study. This
cohort includes 36 diseased donors, together with a control group of 36 age- and
sex-matched healthy donors. In practice this means that every lung cancer
(patient) donor in the cohort was matched with a healthy donor of the same
gender and similar age. This practice helps us control for sampling biases. 
 Table 1 - Cross-validation (CV) 

Cross-validation (CV)   we let the algorithm train on a large
subset of labeled donors and then let it make a prediction on a small subset of
unlabeled donors that were not in the training set. This process is repeated
several times until every donor in the cohort is given a prediction. 
 8  

We use several types of cross- validation: LOO   Leave one out
  one donor is left out of the training set each iteration (total of n
iterations), LTO   Stratified leave two out   two donors are left out of the
training set each iteration, a sick donor and its matched healthy donor (total
of n/2 iterations), 20F   Stratified 20-fold CV   the cohort is split into 20
semi- equal-sized subsets; each subset, containing both sick and healthy donors,
is left out once (total of 20 iterations). In addition, we run the algorithm
once without cross- validation, meaning that the entire cohort is used for
training and prediction. While we are pleased with these promising results,
please note that results can change as we increase the cohort size. 
  Lung cancer  
 American Cancer Society estimates there will be 221,200 new
cases of lung cancer in the USA in 2015, representing 13% of all cancer
diagnoses. Worldwide, there were an estimated 1.8 million new cases of lung
cancer in 2012, accounting for 12.9% of all cancers. Lung cancer is the leading
cancer killer in both men and women in the USA and worldwide. (7) (8)[?] 
 
 Less than 20% of lung cancers are diagnosed at an early stage,
with a five-year survival rate (completely resected NSCLC stage 1A) that ranges
from 67 to 89% (4). Unfortunately, the majority of lung cancer cases (57%) are
diagnosed at an advanced stage when five-year survival is as low as 4%. This is
because lung cancer symptoms present themselves at later stages of the
disease. 
 Cigarette smoke remains the main risk factor for lung cancer,
with 85% to 90% of lung cancer cases in the USA occurring in current or former
smokers. There are about 94 million current and former smokers in the USA. While
clinicians can identify those at risk, they lack effective tools to diagnose
lung cancer early. 
 With improved low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) technology,
it is possible to detect potential malignant nodules in high-risk populations.
Pulmonary nodules are small, focal, radiographic opacities that may be solitary
or multiple. The management goal of patients with pulmonary nodules is to
distinguish between benign and malignant nodules, speeding diagnosis for
malignant nodules while minimizing unnecessary and invasive testing of those
that are benign. Many pulmonary nodules are detected incidentally in computed
tomography (CT) and chest x-rays examination (not related to the indication for
obtaining the CT or x-rays examination) and in scheduled LDCT screening. 
 The largest USA National Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated
that screening high-risk subjects decreases mortality. The current standard of
care for diagnosing lung cancer in high-risk patients is LDCT scanning. This
large trial of 53,454 current or former heavy smokers, ages 55 to 74,
demonstrated that screening high-risk subjects using LDCT decreases mortality
from lung cancer by 20%. Based on this study, the United States Preventive
Services Task force ( USPSTF ) guidelines recommend annual LDCTs for patients at
high risk for lung cancer. However, there are major limitations to CT screening
that create the following two important market needs:  
  Broader Screening  
 Because of cost-benefit ratios (including possible radiation
risks), LDCT was approved only for a heavy- use segment of past and current
smokers. Specifically, Americans aged 55 to 80 years old who have a 30 pack-year
smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This
represents about 10 million people or about 11% of the 94 million past and
current smokers in the US. There is still a major unmet need for a safer, cost-
effective liquid biopsy test that can help screen for lung cancer in the broader
past and current smoker population. 
  Indeterminate Nodules  
 A total of 96.4% of the positive screening results (NLST) in
the low- dose CT group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive
results. The estimated number of pulmonary nodules in the USA ranges from 2
million to 4.9 million annually (1)(2)(3). Using an estimate of 3 million annual
pulmonary nodules, and a false positive rate of 96.4% for LDCT and 94% for x-ray, would generate up to 2.8
million false positive cases a year. In addition, 25% of all LDCTs are
indeterminate, and require additional follow-up procedures. A full
implementation of LDCT screening in the USA will identify 2.5 million
indeterminate nodules and is expected to further increase the number of false
positive cases. 
 9  

After nodule findings, the follow-up procedures to diagnose
lung cancer are expensive, invasive procedures like biopsy. Bronchoscopy can
have significant complication risks, and follow-up imaging adds to radiation
risks. Millions of false positive cases annually could lead to unnecessary
invasive procedures on many smokers or past smokers who do not actually have
lung cancer, driving higher costs, mortality and morbidity. 
 There is an important need for a safer liquid biopsy test that
can assist in the diagnosis of indeterminate nodules and significantly reduce
the number of false positive results. 
  Lung cancer strategy  
 In the longer term, we plan to develop a screening test for
lung cancer. However, our initial goal is to provide an additional tool for
clinicians, designed to assist in the diagnosis of indeterminate nodules
identified by imaging. The Well-Shield test is intended to help a clinician
decide on invasive and/or non-invasive follow- up. It could help reduce the
majority of the false positive results and reduce the number of unnecessary
invasive procedures by more than 200,000 annually in the US (5)(6). As a result,
Well-Shield s test could drive $3.6 billion in annual cost savings in the USA
alone.

   Results of Operations   
 Subsequent to the issuance of the financial statements for the
quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, we determined that there
were errors in those financial statements related to the incorrect accounting
treatment of convertible debentures which has overstated liabilities, additional
paid-in capital and expenses. The effect of the errors was material to the
financial statements for each of the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and
September 30, 2015 so those quarters will be restated for the effects of the
error correction. The details of such restatement and the accounting effects stemming therefrom
have been detailed in Note 11 to the financials statements for the period ended
September 30, 2016. Given that the restatement relates to the treatment of
convertible debentures and the corresponding calculation of stock compensation
expense resulting from granting to certain management personnel with a
conversion option in respect to receivable balances owing to them by our
company, there was no cash effect to the restatements. Moreover, the aggregate
asset balance is unaffected by such change.  
 10  

Revenues  
 We have not earned any revenue from operations since our
inception and further losses are anticipated in the development of our business.
We are currently in the development stage of our business and we can provide no
assurances that we will generate revenue in the foreseeable future.  
  Expenses  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, we incurred the following general and administrative expenses:  
 
 Our expenses decreased by approximately 13% during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily
due to a decrease in stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense item,
partially offset by increases in office and miscellaneous expenses.  
 The research and development expenses recognized in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 is consistent with that of the corresponding
period of 2015. However, there are two important items to note. First, during
the 2015 period the final contractual payment was made to Ramot and was expensed
at the time of disbursement. No similar payment was made or expensed during the
2016 period. Second, compensation paid to two officers of Savicell that was
included in consulting fees in 2015 has instead been classified as part of
research and development expense in 2016. The level of research and development
activity has actually increased in 2016 versus 2015 once the effects of the
final Ramot payment are considered. Given that the research is now being
conducted within Savicell s proprietary laboratory in Haifa, Israel, it incurred
significant compensation expense for employees and consultants for a total
amount of $612,614 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Ramot continues to file patent applications and related submissions
on behalf of Savicell for which Savicell reimburses Ramot for a total amount
of$28,050 during the 2016 period.  
 11  

In addition, we realized increases in rent expense and office
and miscellaneous expenses that result from the opening of Savicell s new
laboratory facility in Haifa, Israel. 
 As stated above,   while the consulting expense decreased
during the period of comparison, that is because for certain individuals, their
compensation was previously classified as consulting expense whereas they are
currently included in the research and development expense, the area in which
their efforts are dedicated. Specifically, the compensation paid to Savicell s
two senior officers are classified as part of research and development expenses
and totaled $164,000 for the none months ended September 30, 2016.  
 The expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 have
increased by 28%. This is primarily due to a 177% increase in research and
development expenses for the reasons discussed above. Moreover, office expenses
increased by $19,068 due additional expense being incurred as a result of the
opening of the laboratory in Haifa. Furthermore, rent expense increased by
$14,979 due to the current premises arrangements requiring monthly rental
payments by Savicell.  
   Liquidity And Capital Resources   
  Working Capital   

Our operations consumed less cash in the first nine months of
2016 versus the corresponding period in 2015 primarily due to the absence of
contractual payments to Ramot in 2016. However, on a collective basis between
our company and Savicell, we raised fewer dollars of new equity capital. Given
that the equity raised in the first nine months of 2016 was less than the cash
used in operations as well as investing activities, we experienced a decline in
our working capital.  
  Recent Financings   
 The Company did not complete any financings for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016.  
  Conversions into Common Stock   
 On October 30, 2012, we announced the entry into a conversion
and participation rights agreement with investors who have purchased ordinary
shares of our subsidiary, Savicell Diagnostic Ltd. (as detailed in our current
report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 1, 2012). Pursuant to the
agreement, we have permitted investors to convert their shares held in Savicell
into shares of our company at 80% of the per share pricing of the first
completed financing of over US$500,000 conducted after July 1, 2012. In each
case of conversion of shares from Savicell to shares of our Company, our
proportional interest in Savicell increases as the shareholder tenders to our
Company their shares of Savicell in return for treasury issued shares of our
Company. In respect of the above conversion terms: 
 On July 7, 2016 we issued an aggregate of 839,375 shares of
common stock converted from shares of our subsidiary Savicell at the conversion
price at $0.16 per share of our common stock. 
 On September 1, 2016 we issued an aggregate of 4,653,732 shares
of common stock converted from shares of our subsidiary Savicell at the
conversion price at $0.16 per share of our common stock. 
 12  

In both these cases, funds had been provided to our subsidiary
Savicell in prior fiscal periods, so no net cash was provided by these Financing
Activities. 
 On July 7, 2016 we issued an aggregate of 50,000 shares of
common stock converted from a stock option exercise notice at the conversion
price at $0.01 per share of our common stock. 
  Cash Flows   
 
  Cash (Used in) Operating Activities   
 The decrease in cash used in operating activities compared to
the same period last year is due to an overall decrease in expenses incurred,
primarily related to the fact that there was no payment to Ramot during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 whereas there had been a material such payment
$800,000 during the comparable period in 2015 that served to increase the
research and development expense.    
  Cash Provided by Financing Activities   
 The decrease in cash provided by financing activities compared
to the same period last year results from fewer equity financings completed by
ourselves and Savicell during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the
corresponding period of 2015. In the relevant period of 2015, we and Savicell
realized equity financings of $1,800,812 and $708,483 respectively. By contrast,
in 2016 all the equity financing was realized by ourselves and amounted to only
$625,500 (including $500 generated by the exercise of vested stock options).
 
  Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities   
 The decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to
the same period last year results from the decreased purchase of assets used in
the furtherance of Savicell s research and development.  
   Plan of Operation    
 We are an early-stage company. There exists substantial doubt
that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months unless we
obtain additional capital to pay our expenses. This is because we have not
generated any revenues and no material revenues are anticipated until we further
develop our business. There is no assurance we will reach this point.  
 Our primary objectives for the next 12 month period are to
further develop the Technology and to advance the Technology so that it may be
appropriate for broader clinical testing. Once this objective is achieved, we
aim to proceed to the commercialization of the Technology. In order to achieve
our objectives we need to raise additional financing. The quantum of financing
to be raised will dictate the pace at which we are able to implement our
business strategies. Once such financing quantum is known, we will be able to
establish an expenditure budget for the ensuing year.  
 If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a
timely basis, if and when it is needed, we may be forced to cease the operation
of our business.  
 13  

Going Concern   
 The financial statements accompanying this report have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our company will continue
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the
normal course of business. Our company has not generated revenues since
inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or
generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of
our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support
from our shareholders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity
financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable
operations. As at September 30, 2016, our company has accumulated deficit of
$9,483,096 since inception. We do not have sufficient working capital to enable
us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next 12 months.  
 Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current
operating expenses and the capital expenses noted in their report on the
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, our independent
auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability
to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note
disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our
independent auditors.  
 The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising
additional financial support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us
could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current
stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be
available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  
   Future Financings   
 We will require additional financing to fund our planned
operations, including further development, clinical testing, regulatory
requirements, and commercializing our existing assets. We currently do not have
committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to obtain
additional financing, particularly, if the volatile conditions in the stock and
financial markets, and more particularly, the market for early development stage
pharmaceutical company stocks persist.  
 There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to
delay or scale down some or all of our development activities or perhaps even
cease the operation of our business.  
 Since inception we have funded our operations primarily through
equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund our
operations through the equity and debt financing. If we raise additional
financing by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders  ownership
will be diluted. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be
available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  
 There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain
operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his, her,
or its investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be
unprofitable.  
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to
stockholders.  
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK   
 Not Applicable.  
 14  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934  (the
  Exchange Act  ), are our controls and other procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange
Act, requires us to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2016. This evaluation was implemented under the supervision and with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer.  
 Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of
September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.
The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the
existence of material weaknesses identified in our annual report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. While we continue to address the
shortcomings, we note that a restatement of certain items previously included in
the financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and September 30,
2016 was required due to the subsequent recognition of errors. The details of
such restatement are highlighted in Note 11 of the financial statements issued
in respect of the period ended September 30, 2016.      
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
   
 During fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. However, the company recognizes its need to improve
the quality of its financial reporting specifically as it relates to the
operations of Savicell. To that end, we have recently engaged a professional
accountant on a part time basis at the Savicell level to upgrade our
capabilities in this area. As our operations continue to expand, we intend to
engage additional accounting personnel as required.  
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 We know of no material pending legal proceedings to which our
company or our subsidiary is a party or of which any of our properties, or the
properties of our subsidiary, is the subject. In addition, we do not know of any
such proceedings contemplated by any governmental authorities.  
 We know of no material proceedings in which any of our
directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder
is a party adverse to our company or our subsidiary or has a material interest
adverse to our company or our subsidiary.  
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   
 An investment in our common stock involves a number of very
significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and
uncertainties in addition to other information in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q in evaluating our company and our business before purchasing shares of our
common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be
seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks.
You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. You
should invest in our common stock only if you can afford to lose your entire
investment.  
 15  

Risks Related to our Company    
  The slowing of the worldwide economic growth may reduce our
ability to obtain the financing necessary to continue our business and may
reduce the number of viable products and businesses that we may wish to acquire.
If we cannot raise the funds that we need or find a suitable product or business
to acquire, we may go out of business and investors will lose their entire
investment in our company.   
 There has been a downturn in general worldwide economic
conditions due to many factors, including the effects of slower economic
activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital
spending, adverse business conditions, increased unemployment and liquidity
concerns. In addition, these economic effects, including the resulting recession
in various countries and slowing of the global economy, will likely result in
fewer business opportunities as companies face increased financial hardship.
Tightening credit and liquidity issues will also result in increased
difficulties for our company to raise capital for our continued operations. We
may not be able to raise money through the sale of our equity securities or
through borrowing funds on terms we find acceptable. If we cannot raise the
funds that we need or find a suitable product or business to acquire, we will go
out of business. If we go out of business, investors will lose their entire
investment in our company.  
  Our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern.   
 We have not generated any revenue from operations since our
incorporation. We expect that our operating expenses will increase over the next
12 months as we continue to ramp-up the scope of our business operations. With
our stated goal of completing our clinical testing, furthering our research and
development and achieving commercialization of the Technology, the pace of our
progress will depend on the quantum of financing raised. As additional financing
is raised, we will continue to accelerate the pace of our overall business
initiatives. Until the amount of financing is known, we cannot precisely
forecast the expenditure budget. On September 30, 2016, we had cash of $621,258
and total liabilities of $766,075. If we are unable to meet our debt service
obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure
or refinance, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets. We might then
be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory
terms. 
  We may need to raise additional funds in the future which
may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.   
 We may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in
the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing
debt, or for general corporate purposes. If we issue equity or convertible debt
securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience
dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional
debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity
capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses. We may not be
able to market such issuances on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we
may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan,
take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or
unanticipated customer requirements.  
  We are an early-stage company with a limited operating
history, which may hinder our ability to successfully meet our objectives.
  
 We are an early-stage company with only a limited operating
history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future
prospects. As a result, the revenue and income potential of our business is
unproven. In addition, because of our limited operating history, we have limited
insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Errors may be made
in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends and we will be subject to
the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage
companies in evolving markets. We may not be able to successfully address any or
all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately do so could cause
our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.  
  Because our directors and officers are not all residents of
the United States, investors may find it difficult to enforce, within the United
States, any judgments obtained against our directors and officers.   
 16  

Our directors and officer are not all residents of the United
States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the
United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within
the United States any judgments obtained against our directors and officers,
including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.  
  If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain
qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations.   
 In order to successfully implement and manage our business
plan, we will depend upon, among other things, successfully recruiting and
retaining qualified personnel having experience in the pharmaceutical industry.
Competition for qualified individuals is intense. We may not be able to find,
attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unable to
find, attract and retain qualified personnel with technical expertise, our
business operations could suffer.  
  Future growth could strain our resources, and if we are
unable to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our
business plan.   
 We hope to experience rapid growth in our operations, which
will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational
and financial infrastructure. Our future success will depend in part upon the
ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. This will
require that we hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding
operations. In addition, we must continue to improve our operational, financial
and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to
successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to execute upon our business
plan.  
   Risks Relating to our Operations in Israel    
  Conditions in Israel and the surrounding Middle East may
materially adversely affect our Subsidiary s operations and personnel.   
 Our Subsidiary has significant operations in Israel, including
research and development. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in
1948, a number of armed conflicts and terrorist acts have taken place, which in
the past, and may in the future, lead to security and economic problems for
Israel. In addition, certain countries in the Middle East adjacent to Israel,
including Egypt and Syria, recently experienced and some continue to experience
political unrest and instability marked by civil demonstrations and violence,
which in some cases resulted in the replacement of governments and regimes.
Current and future conflicts and political, economic and/or military conditions
in Israel and the Middle East region may affect our operations in Israel. The
exacerbation of violence within Israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts
involving Israel may impede our Subsidiary s ability to engage in research and
development, or otherwise adversely affect its business or operations. In
addition, our Subsidiary s employees in Israel may be required to perform annual
mandatory military service and are subject to being called to active duty at any
time under emergency circumstances. The absence of these employees may have an
adverse effect on our Subsidiary s operations. Hostilities involving Israel may
also result in the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its
trading partners, which could materially adversely affect our results of
operations.  
  The ability of our Subsidiary to pay dividends is subject to
limitations under Israeli law and dividends paid and loans extended by our
Subsidiary may be subject to taxes.   
 The ability of our Subsidiary to pay dividends is governed by
Israeli law, which provides that dividends may be paid by an Israeli corporation
only out of its earnings as defined in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law
of 1999, provided that there is no reasonable concern that such payment will
cause such subsidiary to fail to meet its current and expected liabilities as
they come due. Cash dividends paid by an Israeli corporation to United States
resident corporate parents are subject to provisions of the Convention for the
Avoidance of Double Taxation between Israel and the United States, which may
result in our Subsidiary having to pay taxes on any dividends it declares.  
 17  

Risks Relating to the Pharmaceutical Business
   
  If we are unable to successfully acquire, develop or
commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.   
 Our future results of operations will depend to a significant
extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products
and businesses in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in,
developing and commercializing new products, including:  

there are still major developmental steps required to
      bring the product to a clinical testing stage;    

clinical testing may not be positive;    

developing, testing and manufacturing products in
      compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner;    

failure to receive requisite regulatory approvals for
      such products in a timely manner or at all;    

developing and commercializing a new product is time
      consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors, including legal actions
      brought by our competitors, that may delay or prevent the development and
      commercialization of new products;    

incomplete, unconvincing or equivocal clinical trials
      data;    

experiencing delays or unanticipated costs;    

significant and unpredictable changes in the payer
      landscape, coverage and reimbursement for our products;    

experiencing delays as a result of limited resources at
      regulatory agencies; and    

changing review and approval policies and standards at
      regulatory agencies.     
 As a result of these and other difficulties, products in
development by us may or may not receive timely regulatory approvals, or
approvals at all, necessary for marketing by us or other third-party partners.
If any of our products are not approved in a timely fashion or, when acquired or
developed and approved, cannot be successfully manufactured, commercialized or
reimbursed, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot
guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped,
even if we are successful in commercializing those products.  
  Our expenditures may not result in commercially successful
products.   
 We cannot be sure our business expenditures will result in the
successful acquisition, development or launch of products that will prove to be
commercially successful or will improve the long-term profitability of our
business. If such business expenditures do not result in successful acquisition,
development or launch of commercially successful brand products our results of
operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  
  Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary
rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products.
  
 The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the
subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial
litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity
and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Litigation
may be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our
management and technical personnel. In addition, if we infringe on the rights of
others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or market products or
could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary
rights from third parties. Although the parties to patent and intellectual
property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their
disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with
these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties.
Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available
to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, an adverse
determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain
necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products,
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.  
 18  

Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to
have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development,
manufacturing and distribution capabilities.   
 All pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive, complex,
costly and evolving government regulation. For the U.S., this is principally
administered by the FDA and to a lesser extent by the DEA and state government
agencies, as well as by varying regulatory agencies in foreign countries where
products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other
federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations,
govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing,
record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution
of our products.  
 Under these regulations, we may become subject to periodic
inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of
our products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic
inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable
regulations. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct
pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine
whether our systems and processes are in compliance with GMP and other
regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue
observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could cause us to
modify certain activities identified during the inspection. FDA guidelines
specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of  regulatory
significance  for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve
correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. We may also be
required to report adverse events associated with our products to the FDA and
other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns
would result in labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other
regulatory actions.  
 The range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA
issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or
partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA s
review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or
criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash
flows. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke
previously granted drug approvals. Similar sanctions as detailed above may be
available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of
such decree. If internal compliance programs do not meet regulatory agency
standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could
materially harm our business.  
 The product would be licensed for sale in the EU through an EC
certification process, frequently shorthanded as  CE Mark  under the IVDD
98/79/EC. It is possible that general controls are sufficient and a conformity
assessment of a QMS would be sufficient to support clinical testing in the EU.
If a Notified Body must be used, the CE Marking process has two stages: a
certification of the manufacturer s QMS (ability to safely develop devices) and
the certification of the device performance and safety itself. Regulatory
approval may be delayed, limited or denied for a number of reasons, including
insufficient clinical data, the product not meeting safety or efficacy
requirements or any relevant manufacturing processes or facilities not meeting
applicable requirements.  
 Further trials and other costly and time-consuming assessments
of the product may be required to obtain or maintain regulatory approval. We may
be required to conduct additional trials beyond those currently planned, which
could require significant time and expense.  
  The diagnostic industry is highly competitive.   
 The diagnostic industry has an intensely competitive
environment that will require an ongoing, extensive search for technological
innovations and the ability to market products effectively, including the
ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of products to
healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and payers in
managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and Medicare  
Medicaid services. We are smaller than almost all of our competitors. Most of
our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time than us, have
a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other
resources than we do. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are toward
further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities, further
concentrating financial, technical and market strength and increasing
competitive pressure in the industry. If we directly compete with them for the
same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from
capturing a profitable share of those markets. It is possible that developments
by our competitors will make any products or technologies that we acquire
non-competitive or obsolete.  
 19  

Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval,
they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.   
 Even if U.S. regulatory approval or clearance is obtained, the
FDA can impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or
marketing or may impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly
post-approval studies. Any of these restrictions or requirements could adversely
affect our potential product revenues. Our product candidates will also be
subject to ongoing FDA requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage,
advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other
post-market information on the drug. In addition, approved products,
manufacturers and manufacturers  facilities are subject to continual review and
periodic inspections. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown
problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or
frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a
regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including
requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If our product candidates
fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as current Good
Manufacturing Practices, or  CGMPs , a regulatory agency may:  

issue warning letters or untitled letters;    

require us to enter into a consent decree, which can
      include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs,
      required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;

impose other civil or criminal penalties;    

suspend regulatory approval;    

suspend any ongoing clinical trials;    

refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to
      approved applications filed by us;    

impose restrictions on operations, including costly new
      manufacturing requirements; or    

seize or detain products or require a product recall.
        
 Our commercialization efforts will be greatly dependent upon
our ability to demonstrate product efficacy in clinical trials. Laboratories
will be reluctant to order our products, and medical practitioners will be
reluctant to prescribe our products, without compelling supporting data. The
failure to demonstrate efficacy in our clinical trials, or a delay or failure to
complete our clinical trials, would have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.  
  Our failure to convince medical practitioners to use our
technologies will limit our revenue and profitability.   
 If we, or our commercialization partners, fail to convince
medical practitioners to prescribe products using our technologies, we will not
be able to sell our products or license our technologies in sufficient volume
for our business to become profitable. We will need to make leading physicians
aware of the benefits of products using our technologies through published
papers, presentations at scientific conferences and favorable results from our
clinical studies. Our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it
difficult for us to convince medical practitioners to prescribe products using
our technologies for their patients. Failure to convince medical practitioners
to prescribe our products will damage our commercialization efforts and would
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition
and operating results.  
 20  

We may not be able to market or generate sales of our
products to the extent anticipated.   
 Assuming that we are successful in receiving regulatory
clearances to market any of our products, our ability to successfully penetrate
the market and generate sales of those products may be limited by a number of
factors, including the following:  

Certain of our competitors in the field have already
      received regulatory approvals for and have begun marketing similar
      products, which may result in greater physician awareness of their
      products as compared to ours;    

Information from our competitors or the academic
      community indicating that current products or new products are more
      effective than our products could, if and when it is generated, impede our
      market penetration or decrease our existing market share;    

The price for our products, as well as pricing decisions
      by our competitors, may have an effect on our revenues; and    

Our revenues may diminish if third-party payers,
      including private health coverage insurers and health maintenance
      organizations, do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement for our
      products.     
 If any of our future marketed products were to experience
problems related to their efficacy, safety, or otherwise, or if new, more
effective treatments were to be introduced, our revenues from such marketed
products could decrease.  
 If any of our current or future marketed products become the
subject of problems, including those related to, among others:  

efficacy or safety concerns with the products, even if
      not justified;    

regulatory proceedings subjecting the products to
      potential recall;    

publicity affecting doctor prescription or patient use of
      the product;    

pressure from competitive products; or    

introduction of more effective tests.
    
 Our revenues from such marketed products could decrease. For
example, efficacy or safety concerns may arise, whether or not justified, that
could lead to the recall or withdrawal of such marketed products. In the event
of a recall or withdrawal of a product, our revenues would significantly
decline.  
   Risks Relating to our Common Stock    
  If we issue additional shares in the future, it will result
in the dilution of our existing shareholders.   
 Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to
500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Our
board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one
or more companies or products and to fund our overhead and general operating
requirements. The issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per
share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding
shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such
issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current
shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our
corporation.  
  Trading of our stock is restricted by the Securities
Exchange Commission s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder s
ability to buy and sell our common stock.   
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations
which generally define  penny stock  to be any equity security that has a market
price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than
$5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by
the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
sell to persons other than established customers and  accredited investors . The
term  accredited investor  refers generally to institutions with assets in
excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or
annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny
stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and
level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide
the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the
compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and
monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in
the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and
salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in
writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in
writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock
rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt
from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination
that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements
may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary
market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently,
these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our
securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest
in and limit the marketability of our common stock.  
 21  

FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a
stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.   
 In addition to the  penny stock  rules described above, the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as   FINRA  ) has adopted
rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a
broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is
suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status,
tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative
low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA
requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their
customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our
stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.  
  Our common stock is illiquid and the price of our common
stock may be negatively impacted by factors which are unrelated to our
operations.   
 Although our common stock is currently listed for quotation on
the OTC Markets Pink Sheets, there is no market for our common stock. Even when
a market is established and trading begins, trading through the OTC Markets Pink
Sheets is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a
sufficient market will develop in our stock, in which case it could be difficult
for shareholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could
fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception
of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our
competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions
in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our
competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and
volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market
price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their
operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.  
  We do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the
shares of stock of our company.   
 We have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not
intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Because we do not intend
to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come
through an increase in the stock s price. This may never happen and investors
may lose all of their investment in our company.

1.  
     
       I  have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Online  Disruptive Technologies, Inc.; 

2.  
     
        Based  on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a  material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements  made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not  misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  

3.  
     
       Based  on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information  included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial  condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and  for, the periods presented in this report;  

4.  
     
        I  am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and  procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and  internal control over financial   reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  

(a)  
     
       Designed  such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and  procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material  information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated  subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly  during the period in which this report is being prepared;  

(b)  
     
       Designed  such internal control over financial   reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be  designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial   reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles; 

(c)  
     
       Evaluated  the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and  presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure  controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report  based on such evaluation; and

5.  
     
       I  have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the  registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of  directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)  
     
       All significant deficiencies and  material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are  reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,  process, summarize and report financial information; and  

(b)  
     
       Any  fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who  have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
