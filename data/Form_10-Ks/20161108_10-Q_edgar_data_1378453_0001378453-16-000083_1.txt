1. 
    Basis of Presentation, Business Description and Organization 
     TravelCenters of America LLC, which we refer to as the Company or we, us and our, is a Delaware limited liability company. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated and franchised   540   travel center, standalone convenience store, which we refer to as convenience stores, and standalone restaurant locations described below. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants, franchisees and dealers. 
  We manage our business on the basis of   two   reportable segments, travel centers and convenience stores. See Note 7 for more information about our reportable segments. We have a single travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, that we do not consider material to our operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our business included   255   travel centers in   43   states in the United States, or U.S., primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, and the province of Ontario, Canada. Our travel centers included   178   operated under the "TravelCenters of America" and "TA" brand names, or the TA brand, and   77   operated under the "Petro Stopping Centers" and "Petro" brand names, or the Petro brand. Of our   255   travel centers at   September 30, 2016  , we owned   29  , we leased   199  , including   197   that we leased from Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT, we operated   two   for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest and our franchisees owned or leased from others   25  . We operated   225   of our travel centers and franchisees operated   30   travel centers, including   five   we leased to franchisees. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as truck repair and maintenance services, full service restaurants, quick service restaurants, and various customer amenities. We report this portion of our business as our travel center segment. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our business included   233   standalone convenience stores in   11   states in the U.S. We operate our convenience stores primarily under the "Minit Mart" brand name, or the Minit Mart brand. Of these   233   convenience stores at   September 30, 2016  , we owned   198  , we leased   32  , including   one   that we leased from HPT, and we operated   three   for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Our convenience stores offer gasoline as well as a variety of nonfuel products, including coffee, groceries, fresh foods and quick service restaurants. We report this portion of our business as our convenience store segment. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our business included   52   standalone restaurants in   15   states in the U.S. operated primarily under the "Quaker Steak   Lube" brand name, or the QSL brand. Of our   52   standalone restaurants at   September 30, 2016  , we owned   five  , we leased   seven  , we operated   one   for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest and   39   were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We report this portion of our business within corporate and other in our segment information in Note 7. 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, applicable for interim financial statements. The disclosures presented do not include all the information necessary for complete financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , or our Annual Report. In the opinion of our management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, the quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences because our rent expense and certain other costs do not vary seasonally. For this and other reasons, our operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Fair Value Measurement 
  Senior Notes 
  We refer to our   $110,000   of   8.25%   Senior Notes due 2028, our   $120,000   of   8.00%   Senior Notes due 2029, and our   $100,000   of   8.00%   Senior Notes due 2030 collectively as our Senior Notes, which are our senior unsecured obligations. Our Senior Notes have been presented on our consolidated balance sheets as long term debt net of unamortized debt issuance costs totaling   $12,804   and   $13,553   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We estimate that, based on their trading prices (a Level 1 input), the aggregate fair value of our Senior Notes on   September 30, 2016  , was   $337,760  . 
  Goodwill Impairment 
  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of July 31 at the reporting unit level, which is equivalent to our   two   reportable segments, travel centers and convenience stores. Impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value of our goodwill was estimated using both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach considered discounted forecasted cash flows that were based on our long term operating plan. A terminal value was used to estimate the cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The market approach considered comparable publicly traded guideline companies' business value. For each comparable publicly traded guideline company, value indicators, or pricing multiples, were considered to estimate the value of our business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective operating segment. 
  We concluded based on this analysis that as of July 31, 2016, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which establishes a comprehensive revenue recognition standard under GAAP for almost all industries. The new standard will apply for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. We have not yet determined the effects, if any, the adoption of this update may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a reduction of the associated debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB clarified the previous Accounting Standards Update and issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Lines of Credit Arrangements- Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcements on June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  , which addresses the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements. These updates were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and required retrospective application. We adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016, and applied it to all periods presented. Adoption of this standard resulted in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from other noncurrent assets to long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. Debt issuance costs related to our line of credit arrangements remain classified as other noncurrent assets.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,   Leases  , which establishes a comprehensive lease standard under GAAP for virtually all industries. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right of use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The new standard will apply for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the effects the adoption of this update may have on us; however, we believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of the lease rights and obligations as assets and liabilities. While the adoption will have no effect on the cash we pay, amounts within our statements of income and comprehensive income are expected to change materially. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows  , which simplifies elements of cash flow classification and reduces diversity in practice across all industries. The new standard will apply for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein, and requires retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. The implementation of this update is not expected to cause any material changes to our consolidated financial statements. 

2.    
    Acquisitions 
     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   29   convenience stores,   11   standalone restaurants and franchise agreements for an additional   39   restaurants, and accounted for these transactions as business combinations, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. We have included the results of these acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition. The pro forma impact of these acquisitions, including the results of operations of the acquired convenience stores and standalone restaurants from the beginning of the periods presented, is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 
  The following table summarizes the amounts we recorded for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combinations described above, along with resulting goodwill. We expect that amortization of all of the goodwill resulting from these acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. 

(1)   
    Includes standalone restaurants. See Note 7 for more segment information.  
     The purchase price allocations included in the table above, primarily related to real estate, property and equipment, and intangibles, are based on valuations that are not yet finalized. The process for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the use of judgment in determining appropriate assumptions and estimates. As we obtain additional information to finalize these preliminary valuations, adjustments to the recorded amounts may be made during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).

Acquisition costs, such as legal fees, due diligence costs and closing costs, are not included as a component of consideration transferred in business combinations but instead are expensed as incurred.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had entered agreements to acquire   six   restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of   $6,000   and   one   travel center for a purchase price of   $13,050  , excluding closing costs and working capital adjustments. We expect to complete these acquisitions during 2016, but these purchases are subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change. 

3.    
    Shareholders' Equity 
     On May 19, 2016, our shareholders approved the 2016 Equity Compensation Plan, or the 2016 Plan, under which   2,300   shares were authorized for issuance under the terms of the 2016 Plan. 
  Changes in Shareholders' Equity 
  On April 20, 2016, we acquired the Quaker Steak   Lube restaurant business of Lube Holdings, Inc., or the QSL acquisition. The QSL acquisition included a   75%   controlling interest in an entity that operates one restaurant and leases certain assets from another entity in which we own a   25%   interest. These entities are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 for more information about the QSL acquisition. 
  The changes in shareholders' equity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , follow:

Net Income Per Common Share Attributable to Common Shareholders 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to net income available to common shareholders and the related earnings per share.  

(1)   
    Excludes unvested shares granted under our share award plans, which shares are considered participating securities because they participate equally in earnings and losses with all of our other common shares. The weighted average number of unvested shares outstanding for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   1,900   and   1,932  , respectively. The weighted average number of unvested shares outstanding for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   1,904   and   1,933  , respectively. 

4. 
    Related Party Transactions 
       We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with HPT, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR, and others related to them, including other companies to which RMR provides management services and which have trustees, directors and officers who are also our Directors or officers. For further information about these and other such relationships and certain other related party transactions, please refer to our Annual Report. 
  Relationship with HPT    
  HPT is our largest shareholder. As of   September 30, 2016  , HPT owned   3,420   of our common shares, representing approximately   8.8%   of our outstanding common shares. HPT is also our principal landlord. We have   five   leases with HPT, the   four   TA Leases for   158   properties and the Petro Lease for   40   properties. We refer to the   four   TA Leases and the Petro Lease collectively as the HPT Leases. 
  On   June 1, 2015  , we entered a transaction agreement with HPT. On   June 22, 2016  , we and HPT amended the transaction agreement. We refer to the amended transaction agreement as the Transaction Agreement. Under the Transaction Agreement, among other things, we agreed to sell to HPT   four   travel centers upon the completion of their development at a purchase price equal to their development costs, including the cost of the land, and   two   existing travel centers owned by us, and HPT agreed to lease back these properties to us under the HPT Leases. 
  In connection with the Transaction Agreement:

On   June 22, 2016  , we sold   two   existing travel centers for an aggregate of   $23,876  , and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 1   and   TA Lease 3   to add these properties, respectively, and our minimum annual rent under our   TA Lease 1   and   TA Lease 3   increased by   $1,121   and   $908  , respectively. The sale of these   two   properties generated a gain of   $11,794   that was deferred and will be amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases as a reduction of rent expense. We also amended the Petro Lease to extend its term to 2032. 
                 
    On   September 30, 2016  , we sold   one   of the   two   remaining development properties to HPT for   $16,557  , and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 2   to add this property and our minimum annual rent under our   TA Lease 2   increased by   $1,407  . 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the sale and lease back of the remaining development property pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, is expected to be completed before   June 30, 2017  . 
  Because of the relationships between us and HPT, the terms of the Transaction Agreement and lease amendments described above were negotiated and approved by special committees of our Board of Directors and the HPT board of trustees composed of our Independent Directors and HPT's independent trustees who are not also Directors or trustees of the other party, which committees were represented by separate counsel. 
  On   September 14, 2016  , HPT purchased a vacant land parcel located adjacent to a property we lease from HPT in Holbrook, Arizona for   $325  ; and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 4   to add this parcel and our minimum annual rent under our   TA Lease 4   increased by   $28  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the number of properties leased, the terms, the minimum annual rents and the deferred rent balances under our HPT Leases were as follows: 

(1)     
    We have   two   renewal options of   15   years each under each of our HPT Leases. 
               (2)     
    Deferred rent for the TA Lease 1, TA Lease 2, TA Lease 3 and TA Lease 4 is due and payable on the respective initial term end dates noted above. Deferred rent for the Petro Lease is due and payable on June 30, 2024. Deferred rent is subject to acceleration at HPT's option upon an uncured default by, or a change in control of, us.

(1)   
    Sale Leaseback Financing Obligation.   Prior to June 2015, the assets related to   nine   travel centers we leased from HPT were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, as was the related financing obligation. This accounting was required primarily because, at the time of the inception of the applicable HPT Lease, more than a minor portion of these   nine   travel centers was subleased to third parties. In June 2015, we purchased   five   of these   nine   travel centers from HPT. That purchase was accounted for as an extinguishment of the related financing obligation and resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $10,502   because the price we paid to HPT to purchase the   five   properties was   $10,502   in excess of the then remaining related financing obligation. Also, because the TA Leases we entered into with HPT in connection with the Transaction Agreement were accounted for as new leases and   two   of the remaining   four   properties reflected as financings under the prior TA Lease then qualified for operating lease treatment, the remaining net assets and financing obligation related to these   two   properties were eliminated, resulting in a gain of   $1,033  , which was deferred and will be recognized over the terms of the applicable TA Leases as a reduction of rent expense. 
               (2)   
    Straight Line Rent Accrual.   We accrued rent expense from 2007 to 2012 for stated increases in our minimum annual rents due under our then existing TA lease. While the TA Leases we entered into with HPT in connection with the Transaction Agreement contain no stated rent payment increases, we continue to amortize this accrual on a straight line basis over the current terms of the TA Leases as a reduction to real estate rent expense. The straight line rent accrual also includes our obligation for the estimated cost of removal of underground storage tanks at properties leased from HPT at the end of the related lease; we recognize these obligations on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases as additional rent expense. 
               (3)   
    Deferred Gain  . The deferred gain primarily includes   $145,462   of gains from the sales of travel centers and certain other assets to HPT during 2015 and 2016 pursuant to the Transaction Agreement. We amortize the deferred gains on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases as a reduction of rent expense. 
               (4)   
    Deferred     Tenant Improvements Allowance.   HPT funded certain capital projects at the properties we lease under the HPT Leases without an increase in rent payable by us. In connection with HPT's initial capital commitment, we recognized a liability for rent deemed to be related to this capital commitment as a deferred tenant improvements allowance. We amortize the deferred tenant improvements allowance on a straight line basis over the terms of the HPT Leases as a reduction of rent expense. 
               (5)   
    Deferred Rent Obligation.   Pursuant to a rent deferral agreement with HPT, from July 2008 through December 31, 2010, we deferred a total of   $150,000   of rent payable to HPT. This deferred rent obligation was allocated among the HPT Leases. Deferred rent for the TA Leases is due at the end of the initial terms of the respective TA Leases as noted above, and deferred rent for the Petro Lease is due on June 30, 2024. 
     HPT waived percentage rent of   $271   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and   $372   and   $819   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   June 30, 2016  , HPT had cumulatively waived all of the   $2,500   of percentage rent it previously agreed to waive. The total amount of percentage rent (which is net of any waived amounts) was   $408   and   $0   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $937   and   $1,999   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Pursuant to the terms of our HPT Leases, we sold improvements made to properties leased from HPT for   $20,255   and   $29,734   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $75,314   and   $70,150   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, our minimum annual rent payable to HPT increased by   $1,722   and   $2,527   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $6,402   and   $5,963   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , our property and equipment balance included   $55,308   of improvements of the type that we typically request that HPT purchase for an increase in minimum annual rent; however, HPT is not obligated to purchase these improvements.

Relationship with RMR 
  Pursuant to our business management agreement and property management agreement with RMR, we incurred aggregate fees of   $3,935   and   $3,567   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10,748   and   $10,063   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. In August 2016, we and RMR amended our property management agreement to increase the property management fees we pay to RMR to   $36   per year (previously, we paid   $30   per year to RMR for property management fees). 
  We have historically awarded share grants to certain RMR employees under our equity compensation plan. In addition, under our business management agreement we reimburse RMR for our allocable costs for internal audit services. The amounts recognized as expense for share grants to RMR employees and internal audit costs were   $989   and   $868   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3,186   and   $2,555   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively; these amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 
  Relationship with AIC 
  We and   six   other companies to which RMR provides management services each own in equal amounts Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, an insurance company. We and the other AIC shareholders participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and reinsured in part by AIC. We paid aggregate annual premiums, including taxes and fees, of approximately   $2,186   in connection with this insurance program for the policy year ending June 30, 2017, which amount may be adjusted from time to time as we acquire and dispose of properties that are included in this insurance program. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment in AIC had a carrying value of   $7,110   and   $6,828  , respectively. These amounts are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognized income (loss) of   $14   and   $(25)   related to our investment in AIC for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $108   and   $70   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our other comprehensive income includes our proportional share of unrealized gains (losses) on securities held for sale, which are owned by AIC, of   $80   and   $(72)   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $175   and   $(91)   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance 
  We, The RMR Group Inc., the managing member of RMR, RMR and certain companies to which RMR provides management services participate in a combined directors' and officers' liability insurance policy. In September 2016, we participated in a one year extension of this combined directors' and officers' insurance policy through September 2018. Our premium for this policy extension was approximately   $91   for the current policy year ending September 2017. 
  Relationship with PTP 
  We own a   40%   minority interest in Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC, or PTP. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment in PTP had a carrying value of   $20,507   and   $20,042  , respectively, which amounts are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In February 2016, we began managing a third standalone convenience store PTP owns. As of   September 30, 2016  , we managed   two   travel centers,   three   convenience stores and   one   restaurant for PTP for which we receive management and accounting fees. We recognized management fee income of   $323   and   $200   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $776   and   $600   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. In addition to the management fees we earned, we recognized income of   $1,520   and   $1,361   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3,464   and   $3,086   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a net payable to PTP of   $834   and net receivable from PTP of   $43  , respectively.

    Contingencies 
     Legal Proceedings 
  We are routinely involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, including tax audits, incidental to the ordinary course of our business, none of which we expect, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Environmental Contingencies 
  Extensive environmental laws regulate our operations and properties. These laws may require us to investigate and clean up hazardous substances, including petroleum or natural gas products, released at our owned and leased properties. Governmental entities or third parties may hold us liable for property damage and personal injuries, and for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs incurred in connection with any contamination and regulatory compliance at our locations. We use both underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks to store petroleum products, natural gas and other hazardous substances at our locations. We must comply with environmental laws regarding tank construction, integrity testing, leak detection and monitoring, overfill and spill control, release reporting and financial assurance for corrective action in the event of a release. At some locations we must also comply with environmental laws relative to vapor recovery or discharges to water. Under the terms of the HPT Leases, we generally have agreed to indemnify HPT for any environmental liabilities related to properties that we lease from HPT and we are required to pay all environmental related expenses incurred in the operation of the leased properties. Under an agreement with Equilon Enterprises LLC doing business as Shell Oil Products US, or Shell, we have agreed to indemnify Shell and its affiliates from certain environmental liabilities incurred with respect to our travel centers where Shell has installed natural gas fueling lanes. 
  From time to time we have received, and in the future likely will receive, notices of alleged violations of environmental laws or otherwise have become or will become aware of the need to undertake corrective actions to comply with environmental laws at our locations. Investigatory and remedial actions were, and regularly are, undertaken with respect to releases of hazardous substances at our locations. In some cases we received, and may receive in the future, contributions to partially offset our environmental costs from insurers, from state funds established for environmental clean up associated with the sale of petroleum products or from indemnitors who agreed to fund certain environmental related costs at locations purchased from those indemnitors. To the extent we incur material amounts for environmental matters for which we do not receive or expect to receive insurance or other third party reimbursement or for which we have not previously recorded a liability, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, or we become subject to costs and requirements not similarly experienced by our competitors, our competitive position may be harmed. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a gross accrued liability of   $4,951   for environmental matters as well as a receivable for expected recoveries of certain of these estimated future expenditures of   $1,063  , resulting in an estimated net amount of   $3,888   that we expect to fund in the future. We cannot precisely know the ultimate costs we may incur in connection with currently known or future potential environmental related violations, corrective actions, investigation and remediation; however, we do not expect the costs for such matters to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to our financial position or results of operations.

In February 2014, we reached an agreement with the California State Water Resources Control Board, or the State Water Board, to settle certain claims the State Water Board had filed against us in California Superior Court in 2010 relating to alleged violations of underground storage tank laws and regulations for a cash payment of   $1,800  ; suspended penalties of   $1,000   that may become payable by us in the future if, prior to March 2019, we fail to comply with specified underground storage tank laws and regulations; and our agreement to invest, prior to March 2018, up to   $2,000   of verified costs that are directly related to the development and implementation of a comprehensive California Enhanced Environmental Compliance Program for the underground storage tank systems at all of our California facilities that is above and beyond minimum requirements of California law and regulations related to underground storage tank systems. The settlement, which was approved by the Superior Court on February 20, 2014, also included injunctive relief provisions requiring that we comply with certain California environmental laws and regulations applicable to underground storage tank systems. In October 2015, the State Water Board issued a notice of alleged suspended penalty conduct claiming that we are liable for the full amount of the   $1,000   in suspended penalties as a result of   five   alleged violations of underground storage tank regulations and requesting further information concerning the alleged violations. In November 2015, we filed our response to the October 2015 notice of alleged suspended penalties and in June and September 2016 we met with the State Water Board to attempt to resolve these matters. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these alleged violations, but cannot predict whether any penalties relating to these matters will be assessed by the Superior Court, which has retained jurisdiction over such matters. The State Water Board also has retained the right to file a separate action relating to these violations, but to date has not done so. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have recognized a liability of   $2,264   with respect to these matters concerning the State Water Board and believe, though we can provide no assurance, that any additional amount of loss we may realize above that accrued, if any, upon the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to us.  
  We currently have insurance of up to   $10,000   per incident and up to   $25,000   in the aggregate for certain environmental liabilities, subject, in each case, to certain limitations and deductibles. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain similar environmental insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms. 
  We cannot predict the ultimate effect changing circumstances and changing environmental laws may have on us in the future or the ultimate outcome of matters currently pending. We cannot be certain that contamination presently unknown to us does not exist at our sites, or that material liability will not be imposed on us in the future. If we discover additional environmental issues, or if government agencies impose additional environmental requirements, increased environmental compliance or remediation expenditures may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
  Other Disputes 
  Many of our customers use fuel cards issued by Comdata Inc., or Comdata, to make payments to us. On September 12, 2016, we received a letter from Comdata alleging that we were in default under the Comdata Merchant Agreement, of December 15, 2010, (as amended on December 14, 2011) by and between Comdata and us, or the Comdata Merchant Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to accept Comdata fuel cards for certain purchases by our customers through January 2, 2022. The September 12, 2016, letter from Comdata alleges default under the Comdata Merchant Agreement due to our purported failure to comply with a separate agreement with Comdata to install radio frequency identification, or RFID, technology at   224   of our company operated travel center locations. In its letter, Comdata threatened to terminate both agreements unless we cured the alleged default on or before October 13, 2016. Although we disputed, and continue to dispute, Comdata's assertions, by letter dated October 13, 2016, we informed Comdata that we had substantially completed installation of the RFID technology, that the technology had been installed and was operational at   201   of our travel center locations, that   one   location had been operational but was damaged and under repair, and that the remaining   22   travel center locations would be outfitted with the RFID technology as soon as we received the required hardware and licenses previously ordered from Comdata. On November 3, 2016, we received a letter from Comdata purporting to terminate both agreements effective immediately and offering to continue the terms of the agreements for up to 90 days. The Comdata Merchant Agreement provides that in the event that either party engages legal counsel to enforce, protect or preserve any rights it might have under such agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney s fees and associated costs, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled. We do not believe that Comdata has the right to terminate either of our agreements under the present circumstances and are considering our response.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or this Quarterly Report, and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , or our Annual Report. Amounts are in thousands of dollars or gallons unless indicated otherwise. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to our convenience stores and restaurants refer to our standalone convenience stores and restaurants and not the convenience stores and restaurants located at our travel centers or restaurants at our convenience stores.  

Company Overview 
  TravelCenters of America LLC, which we refer to as the Company or we, us and our, is a Delaware limited liability company. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated and franchised   540   travel center, standalone convenience store and standalone restaurant locations described below. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants, franchisees and dealers. 
  We manage our business on the basis of   two   reportable segments, travel centers and convenience stores. See Note 1 and Note 7 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information about our reportable segments. We have a single travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, that we do not consider material to our operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our business included   255   travel centers in   43   states in the United States, or U.S., primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, and the province of Ontario, Canada. Our travel centers included   178   operated under the "TravelCenters of America" and "TA" brand names, or the TA brand, and   77   operated under the "Petro Stopping Centers" and "Petro" brand names, or the Petro brand. Of our   255   travel centers at   September 30, 2016  , we owned   29  , we leased   199  , including   197   that we leased from Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT, we operated   two   for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest and our franchisees owned or leased from others   25  . We operated   225   of our travel centers and franchisees operated   30   travel centers, including   five   we leased to franchisees. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as truck repair and maintenance services, full service restaurants, quick service restaurants, and various customer amenities. We report this portion of our business as our travel center segment. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our business included   233   convenience stores in   11   states in the U.S. We operate our convenience stores primarily under the "Minit Mart" brand name, or the Minit Mart brand. Of these   233   convenience stores at   September 30, 2016  , we owned   198  , we leased   32  , including   one   that we leased from HPT, and we operated   three   for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Our convenience stores offer gasoline as well as a variety of nonfuel products, including coffee, groceries, fresh foods and quick service restaurants. We report this portion of our business as our convenience store segment.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our business included   52   standalone restaurants in   15   states in the U.S. operated primarily under the "Quaker Steak   Lube" brand name, or the QSL brand.

We report this portion of our business within corporate and other in our segment information. 
   
  Executive Summary 
  Our revenues and income are subject to material changes as a result of market prices and the availability of diesel fuel and gasoline. These factors are subject to the worldwide petroleum products supply chain, which historically has experienced price and supply volatility as a result of, among other things, severe weather, terrorism, political crises, military actions and variations in supply and demand that are often the result of changes in the macroeconomic environment. Over the past few years there have been significant changes in the cost of fuel. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the average fuel price was   9.2%   and   24.6%  , respectively, below the average fuel price during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Some current economic forecasts reflect continued low prices for fuel; however, as noted above, various factors and events can cause fuel prices to change, sometimes suddenly and sharply.

     Table of Contents  

Due to the volatility of our fuel costs and our pricing to fuel customers, we believe that fuel revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in fuel prices, our fuel revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in fuel sales volumes or in fuel gross margin. We therefore consider fuel sales volume and fuel gross margin to be better measures of our performance. We generally are able to pass changes in our cost for fuel products to customers, but typically with a delay, such that during periods of rising fuel commodity prices, fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be lower than they otherwise may have been, and during periods of falling fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be higher than they otherwise may have been.     Increases and volatility in the prices we pay for fuel can have negative effects on our sales and profitability and increase our working capital requirements. For more information about fuel market risks that may affect us and our actions to mitigate those risks, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report. 
  We believe that demand for fuel by trucking companies for any given level of trucking activity will be reduced over time by technological innovations that permit, and regulations that encourage, require or give rise to, improved fuel efficiency of motor vehicle engines, and other fuel conservation practices. We believe these factors, combined with managing our fuel sales pricing to balance sales volume and profitability and lower levels of freight activity, were contributors to decreases in the level of fuel sales volumes we realized on a same site basis for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Our fuel sales volume increased during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of sites we acquired since the beginning of the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Our fuel gross margin and fuel gross margin per gallon for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , were higher than those in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to newly acquired locations and a continued focus on managing our fuel gross margin by balancing competitive pricing decisions with their impact on sales volume. Our fuel gross margin and fuel gross margin per gallon for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were lower than those in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The increase in our net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , was primarily attributable to our recently acquired sites. The decrease in our net income attributable to common shareholders we experienced for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was primarily due to lower fuel gross margin for the 2016 period for the reasons noted above as well as the effect of expenses associated with recently acquired sites.  

Factors Affecting Comparability 
  Transaction Agreement with HPT 
  On   June 1, 2015  , we entered a transaction agreement with HPT. On   June 22, 2016  , we and HPT amended the transaction agreement. We refer to the amended transaction agreement as the Transaction Agreement. Under the Transaction Agreement, among other things, we agreed to sell to HPT   four   travel centers upon the completion of their development at a purchase price equal to their development costs, including the cost of the land, and   two   existing travel centers owned by us, and HPT agreed to lease back these properties to us under the HPT Leases. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of our Annual Report for more information about our sale leaseback and other related transactions with HPT. 
  On   March 31, 2016  , we sold   one   of the development properties to HPT for   $19,683  , and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 4   to add this property and increase our minimum annual rent under this lease by   $1,673  .  
  On   June 22, 2016  , we sold two existing travel centers for an aggregate of   $23,876  , and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 1   and   TA Lease 3   to add these properties and increase our minimum annual rent under these leases by   $1,121   and   $908  , respectively. 
  On   June 30, 2016  , we sold   one   of the development properties to HPT for   $22,297  , and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 2   to add this property. Our minimum annual rent under our   TA Lease 2   increased by   $1,895  .  
  On   September 30, 2016  , we sold   one   of the development properties to HPT for   $16,557  , and we and HPT amended our   TA Lease 2   to add this property. Our minimum annual rent under out   TA Lease 2   increased by   $1,407  .

  Recently Acquired Sites 
  From the beginning of   2015   through   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   three   travel centers,   198   convenience stores, 12 standalone restaurants and franchise agreements for an additional 39 restaurants. As of   September 30, 2016  , our investments in these acquired travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants totaled   $19,017  ,   $377,811   and   $32,171  , respectively. We estimate that we will invest an additional   $9,355   to complete the expansion and renovation of these travel centers,   $7,344   to complete the rebranding, expansion and improvements of these convenience stores and   $1,719   to complete the renovation and improvements of these restaurants. We are also currently planning to invest an additional   $5,370   to make certain improvements to travel centers acquired prior to   2015  . 
  Since our current acquisition program began in 2011, and through the   third   quarter of   2016  , we have acquired   317   travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants. As of   September 30, 2016  , our investments, including improvements, in these travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants acquired totaled   $321,897  ,   $444,302   and   $32,171   respectively. We estimate that we will invest an additional   $14,725   to complete the expansion and renovation of certain of these travel centers,   $7,344   to complete the rebranding, expansion and improvements of certain of these convenience stores and   $1,719   to complete renovation and improvements of certain of these standalone restaurants. Of the   317   locations acquired since 2011, we operate   277   of the locations and franchisees operate 40. The   317   locations we acquired generated site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses of   $89,961   in the time we owned them during the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , and are expected to generate additional amounts of site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses when these acquired sites become fully stabilized, although there can be no assurance that these locations will operate profitably or that our profits from these locations will increase. 
  The cost of capital improvements to recently purchased travel centers and the development of new travel centers are often substantial and require a long period of time to plan, design, permit and complete; and, after being completed, the improved, or new, travel centers require a period of time to become part of our customers' supply networks and produce stabilized financial results. We estimate that the travel centers we acquire or develop generally will reach stabilization in approximately the third year after acquisition or completion of development. We estimate that the convenience stores we acquire generally will reach stabilization in approximately one year after acquisition. Actual results for travel centers and convenience stores can vary widely from these estimates due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and there can be no assurance that acquired sites will operate profitably. 

Seasonality 
    Our sales volumes are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters than the second and third quarters of each year. In the first quarter, the movement of freight by professional truck drivers as well as motorist travel are usually at their lowest levels of each calendar year. In the fourth quarter, freight movement is typically lower due to the holiday season. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences as our rent and certain other costs do not vary seasonally.

Results of Operations 
  Consolidated Financial Results     
  The following table presents changes in our operating results for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Revenues.   Fuel revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   decrease  d from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , by   $83,588  , or   8.1%  , and   $571,102  , or   18.1%  , respectively. The tables below show the change in sales volumes and fuel revenues by segment. Corporate and other fuel gallons sold and fuel revenues represent wholesale sales to the joint venture we operate and to other retailers. 

The decreases in fuel revenue for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were due to significant decreases in market prices for fuel and lower fuel sales volume in our travel center segment, partially offset by increases in fuel sales volume in our convenience store segment as a result of newly acquired locations. 
  Nonfuel revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $50,870  , or   10.7%  , and   $154,900  , or   11.6%  , respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of newly acquired locations. 
  Fuel gross margin.   Fuel gross margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $7,483  , or   7.3%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  ; this   increase   in fuel gross margin was primarily due to recently acquired locations and our managing fuel sales profitability by balancing sales volume and pricing. Fuel gross margin for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $7,497  , or   2.4%  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   in fuel gross margin was primarily due to a favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , partially offset by the positive effect of recently acquired locations. 
  Nonfuel gross margin.   Nonfuel gross margin for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $27,505  , or   10.9%  , and   $74,567  , or   10.3%  , respectively compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , due primarily to recently acquired sites and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was   53.3%   and   53.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   53.6%   and   54.3%  , for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Nonfuel gross margin percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2016, remained relatively flat, whereas nonfuel gross margin percentage for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , decreased compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease in nonfuel gross margin percentage is primarily due to the inclusion of additional convenience stores, as a result of acquisitions since the beginning of   2015  . Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations. 
  Site level operating expenses.   Site level operating expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $18,369  , or   8.0%  , and   $68,621  , or   10.4%  , respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   due primarily to the newly acquired convenience stores and restaurants. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenue were   47.1%   and   48.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   48.8%   and   49.4%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These improved expense ratios reflect both the larger portion of our operations conducted at standalone convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our recently acquired sites.

Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $5,052  , or   17.0%  , and   $14,349  , or   16.4%  , respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to increased personnel required to support the growth of our business, as well as increased spending on marketing and promotional activities. 
  Real estate rent expense.   Real estate rent expense for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $5,957  , or   9.8%  , and   $25,310  , or   14.9%  , respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT of travel centers and improvements at leased sites since the beginning of   2015  . 
  Depreciation and amortization expense.   Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $5,253  , or   30.1%  , and   $11,459  , or   21.6%  , respectively, from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the locations we acquired and other capital investments we completed (and did not subsequently sell to HPT) since the beginning of   2015  . The increase was partially offset by the reduction in our depreciable assets as a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June   2015   and September   2015   of   14   owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at   11   properties leased from HPT, as well as the sale to, and lease back from, HPT of   two   properties in 2016. 
  Interest expense, net.   Interest expense, net, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $2,158  , or   42.8%  , and   $4,300  , or   26.1%  , respectively, from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increases in interest expense, net were primarily a result of our issuance of   $100,000   of   8.00%   Senior Notes due 2030 in October   2015  . 
  Provision for income taxes  . The income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of   36.3%   and   38.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   35.8%   and   39.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain tax credits that were enacted in December of 2015 and applied retrospectively for 2015 and prospectively for 2016.

Segment Results of Operations 
  The following is a discussion of fuel and nonfuel revenue and site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses by reportable segment. 
  As part of this discussion and analysis of our reportable segment operating results we refer to increases and decreases in results on a same site basis. We include a location in the same site comparisons only if we continuously operated it for the entire duration since the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with the exception of locations we operate that are owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Same site data also excludes revenues and expenses that were not generated at locations we operate, such as rent and royalties from franchisees, revenues from the dealer operated convenience store and corporate level selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not exclude locations from the same site comparisons as a result of capital improvements to the site or changes in the services offered.  

Travel Centers 
  The following table presents changes in the operating results of our travel center segment for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared with the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

The following table presents our same site operating results for our travel center segment for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared with the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 

Revenues.   Fuel revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   decrease  d by   $134,925  , or   14.3%  , and   $753,566  , or   25.3%  , respectively, from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The table below shows the changes in total fuel revenues of our travel center segment based on price and volume changes between periods.

     Table of Contents  

Fuel revenues primarily reflected decreases in market prices for fuel and sales volume from same sites. On a same site basis, fuel sales volume decreased by   24,549   gallons, or   4.8%  , and   61,497   gallons, or   4.1%  , during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to truck engine efficiency improvements and other fuel conservation efforts, as well as our managing fuel sales profitability by balancing sales volume and pricing, the effect of competition and lower levels of freight activity. 
  Nonfuel revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $3,394  , or   0.8%  , and   $14,065  , or   1.1%  , respectively, from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to nonfuel sales at newly acquired locations partially offset by decreases in nonfuel sales on a same site basis. The decreases on a same site basis were primarily due to lower revenue at full service restaurants due to closing certain of our restaurants during slower night time periods and a decrease in tire sales revenue primarily due to increased competition.  
  Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses.   Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $10,507  , or   8.7%  , from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to both an increase on a same site basis and our recently acquired locations and reflects the net increase in profitability from closing certain of our restaurants during slower night time periods.  
   On a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses   increase  d for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting from increases in fuel and nonfuel gross margin due to a continued focus on managing fuel sales pricing to balance sales volume and profitability and a favorable change in the mix of products and services sold, as well as a decrease in site level operating expenses. 
  Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   decrease  d by   $17,364  , or   4.7%  , from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , that was due to a   decrease   of   $20,729  , or   5.7%  , on a same site basis partially offset by an increase due to newly acquired locations. 
  On a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses   decrease  d for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of a decrease in fuel gross margin primarily due to a favorable purchasing experience in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and an increase in site level operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to a favorable change in the mix of products and services sold.

     Table of Contents  

The increase in fuel revenues in our convenience store segment was due to sales volume at recently acquired locations, partially offset by decreases in market prices for fuel and a decrease in fuel sales volume on a same site basis. On a same site basis, fuel sales volume decreased by   406   gallons, or   1.8%  , and   797   gallons, or   2.5%  , respectively, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to our managing fuel sales pricing to balance sales volume and profitability and the effect of competition. 
  Nonfuel revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $38,609  , or   89.6%  , and   $124,884  , or   130.5%  , respectively, from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increases in nonfuel revenues are primarily the result of recently acquired locations. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenue increased modestly, despite the decline in fuel sales volume, as operations at newer sites continued to stabilize.  
  Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses.   Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d by   $4,828  , or   65.1%  , and   $14,738  , or   118.4%  , respectively, from the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to recently acquired locations.  
  On a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses   decrease  d for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to a decrease in fuel gross margin primarily resulting from decreases in fuel sales volume. 
  On a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses   increase  d for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to an increase in fuel gross margin primarily resulting from our continued focus on managing our fuel sales pricing to balance sales volume and profitability, an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to a favorable change in the mix of products and services sold, and a decrease in site level operating expenses.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal liquidity requirements are to meet our operating and financing costs and to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are our: 
             
    cash balance; 
                
    operating cash flow; 
                
    revolving credit facility with a current maximum availability of   $200,000  , or our Credit Facility, subject to limits based on our qualified collateral; 
                
    sales to HPT, for an increase in our rent, of improvements we make to the sites we lease from HPT and the development site to be sold to HPT under the Transaction Agreement; 
                
    potential issuances of new debt and equity securities; and 
                
    potential financing or selling of unencumbered real estate that we own. 
     We believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are: 
             
    the risk of a renewed economic slowdown or recession; 
                
    continuing decreased demand for our fuel products resulting from regulatory and market efforts for improved engine fuel efficiency and fuel conservation generally; 
                
    decreased demand for our products and services that we may experience as a result of competition; 
                
    a significant portion of our expenses are fixed in nature, which may restrict our ability to realize a sufficient reduction in our expenses to offset a reduction in our revenues; 
                
    the negative impacts on our gross margins and working capital requirements if there were a return to the higher level of prices for petroleum products we experienced during the first half of 2014 and in prior years, as well as the volatility of those prices; and 
                
    the possible inability of recently acquired or developed properties to generate the stabilized financial results we expect. 
     
   32 

     Table of Contents  

Our business requires substantial amounts of working capital, including cash liquidity, and our working capital requirements can be especially large because of the volatility of fuel prices. Our growth strategy of selectively acquiring additional properties and businesses and developing new sites requires us to expend substantial additional capital. In addition, our properties are high traffic sites with many customers, including large trucks, entering and exiting our properties daily, requiring us to expend capital to improve, repair and maintain our properties. Although we had a cash balance of   $137,288   on   September 30, 2016  , and net cash   provided by   operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016  , there can be no assurance that we will maintain similar amounts of cash, that we will generate future profits or positive cash flows or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if and when it becomes necessary. 
  Liquidity Aspects of Transactions with HPT 
  Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, HPT agreed to purchase from us, for our cost, four travel centers then being or to be developed, on land parcels we then owned, upon their completion, if such development were completed prior to   June 30, 2017  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had completed construction of   three   of these travel centers and had   one   of these travel centers under construction. On each of   March 31, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2016  , we sold to HPT for   $19,683  ,   $22,297  , and   $16,557  , respectively, and leased back from HPT,   one   of the completed travel centers. Also pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we agreed to sell to and lease back from HPT   two   existing travel centers owned by us for an aggregate of   $23,876  . We expect to sell to HPT the remaining development property during the   first quarter of 2017  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had invested   $18,838   (including land costs) for the remaining development property and we estimate a remaining development cost of   $9,393  . 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have a Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks that matures on December 19, 2019. Under the Credit Facility, a maximum of   $200,000   may be drawn, repaid and redrawn until maturity. The availability of this maximum amount is subject to limits based on qualified collateral. Subject to available collateral and lender participation, the maximum amount may be increased to   $300,000  . The Credit Facility may be used for general business purposes and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. Generally, no principal payments are due until maturity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate based on, at our option, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a premium (which premium is subject to adjustment based upon facility availability, utilization and other matters). At   September 30, 2016  , based on our qualified collateral, a total of   $116,211   was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility but we had outstanding   $31,818   of letters of credit issued under that facility, which reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, leaving   $84,393   available for our use as of that date. 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Cash Flow from Operating Activities  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had net cash   inflows   from operating activities of   $109,107   and   $140,661  , respectively. The   decrease   in operating cash inflows of   $31,554   was primarily due to lower operating income and higher working capital levels. 
  Cash Flow from Investing Activities  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had net cash   outflows   from investing activities of   $143,605   and   $91,095  , respectively. The increase in cash outflows from investing activities resulted from higher capital expenditures due to renovations at recently acquired sites and lower proceeds from asset sales due to the sale to HPT of 14 travel centers and certain assets at other properties leased from HPT in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement. These uses of cash were partially offset by lower cash requirements due to a reduction in acquisition activity. See Note 2 and Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information about our acquisitions and transactions with HPT. 
  Cash Flow from Financing Activities  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had net cash   outflows   from financing activities of   $326   and   $45,134  , respectively. The lower use of cash in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of a financing obligation during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of $45,042 for five properties we purchased from HPT that we had previously leased.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than with respect to the debt owed by Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC, or PTP, an entity in which we own a noncontrolling interest. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and Notes 11 and 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of our Annual Report for more information about our relationship and transactions with PTP. 

Related Party Transactions 
  We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with HPT, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR, and others related to them.

Environmental and Climate Change Matters 
    Legislation and regulation regarding climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental matters and market reaction to any such legislation or regulation or to climate change concerns, may decrease the demand for our fuel products, may require us to expend significant amounts and may negatively impact our business. For instance, federal and state governmental requirements addressing emissions from trucks and other motor vehicles, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's, or EPA's, gasoline and diesel sulfur control requirements that limit the concentration of sulfur in motor fuel, as well as new fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty commercial trucks released in March 2016, has caused us to add certain services and provide certain products to our customers at a cost to us that we may be unable to pass through to our customers for increased sales revenues. Also, various private initiatives and government regulations to promote fuel efficiency that raise the cost of trucking as compared to other types of freight transport, may decrease the demand for our fuel products and negatively impact our business. For example, pursuant to the President's executive order, in August 2016 the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established final regulations that will phase in more stringent greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty trucks beginning in model year 2021 (model year 2018 for certain trailers) through model year 2027, and these regulations are estimated to reduce fuel usage between 9% and 25% (depending on vehicle category) by model year 2027. We may not be able to completely offset the loss of business we may suffer as a result of increasing engine efficiency and other fuel conservation efforts.  
  In addition, there have recently been severe weather events in different parts of the country that some observers believe evidence global climate change. Such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own, lease or operate. We mitigate these risks by owning, leasing and operating a diversified portfolio of properties, by procuring insurance coverage we believe adequately protects us from material damages and losses and by attempting to monitor and be prepared for such events. However, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that storms that may occur due to future climate change or otherwise could not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
  For further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, and the related risks that may arise, see the disclosure under the heading "Environmental Contingencies" in Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016. Our exposure to market risks has not changed materially from those set forth in our Annual Report. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  
  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. WHENEVER WE USE WORDS SUCH AS "BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "INTEND," "PLAN," "ESTIMATE," "WILL," "MAY" AND NEGATIVES AND DERIVATIVES OF THESE OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON OUR PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. AMONG OTHERS, THE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT APPEAR IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT THAT MAY NOT OCCUR INCLUDE STATEMENTS THAT: 
             
    WE EXPECT THAT LOCATIONS WE ACQUIRE WILL PRODUCE STABILIZED FINANCIAL RESULTS AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING ACQUISITION, AND THAT THESE LOCATIONS WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OF SITE LEVEL GROSS MARGIN IN EXCESS OF SITE LEVEL OPERATING EXPENSES ONCE FULLY STABILIZED. THIS STATEMENT IMPLIES THAT THE EXPECTED STABILIZATION OF OUR ACQUIRED SITES WILL GENERATE INCREASED NET INCOME. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE LOCATIONS WE HAVE ACQUIRED OR MAY ACQUIRE PRODUCED OPERATING RESULTS THAT CAUSED THE PRIOR OWNERS TO EXIT THESE BUSINESSES AND OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE THESE LOCATIONS PROFITABLY DEPENDS UPON MANY FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ACCORDINGLY, OUR ACQUIRED SITES MAY NOT GENERATE INCREASED NET INCOME OR IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN WE EXPECT FOR OUR NET INCOME TO INCREASE; 
                
    WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS AND MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS IMPLY THAT PENDING ACQUISITIONS WILL BE COMPLETED AND THAT COMPLETED AND PENDING ACQUISITIONS WILL IMPROVE OUR FUTURE EARNINGS. HOWEVER, OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS WHICH MAY NOT BE MET. THESE ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE COMPLETED OR MAY BE DELAYED OR THEIR TERMS MAY CHANGE. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT MAY RESULT IN OUR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACQUIRE AND RENOVATE ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS TO PRODUCE EARNINGS, INCLUDING COMPETITION FOR SUCH ACQUISITIONS FROM OTHER BUYERS OR OUR INABILITY TO NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE PURCHASE TERMS. MOREOVER, MANAGING AND INTEGRATING ACQUIRED LOCATIONS CAN BE DIFFICULT, TIME CONSUMING AND/OR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANTICIPATED. ALL OF OUR ACQUISITIONS CREATE RISKS OF FINANCIAL LOSSES. WE MAY NOT OPERATE OUR ACQUIRED LOCATIONS PROFITABLY; 
                
    WE HAVE AGREED TO SELL AND LEASE BACK TO HPT, UPON COMPLETION OF ITS DEVELOPMENT, A FULL SERVICE TRAVEL CENTER. THIS STATEMENT IMPLIES THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND RELATED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTION WILL BE COMPLETED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT MAY RESULT IN OUR NOT BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP AND SELL AND LEASE BACK THIS ADDITIONAL LOCATION, INCLUDING PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS. ALSO, OUR AND HPT'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS TYPICAL OF LARGE, COMPLEX REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS. SOME OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND, AS A RESULT, THIS TRANSACTION MAY BE DELAYED, MAY NOT OCCUR OR THE TERMS MAY CHANGE; 
                
    WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO RENOVATE RECENTLY ACQUIRED PROPERTIES AND TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROPERTY. IN ADDITION, THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES US TO REGULARLY EXPEND CAPITAL TO RENOVATE, REPAIR AND IMPROVE OUR PROPERTIES. AN IMPLICATION OF THESE STATEMENTS MAY BE THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MAKE THESE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. SOME CAPITAL PROJECTS COST MORE AND TAKE LONGER TO COMPLETE THAN ANTICIPATED. CURRENTLY UNANTICIPATED PROJECTS THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE IN THE FUTURE (AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS OR REGULATION, ADVANCES OR CHANGES MADE BY OUR COMPETITION, OR FOR OTHER REASONS) MAY ARISE AND CAUSE US TO SPEND MORE THAN CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED. AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, WE MAY DEFER CERTAIN CAPITAL PROJECTS AND SUCH DEFERRALS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS OR  
     
   36 

     Table of Contents  

REQUIRE US TO MAKE LARGER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FUTURE. ALSO, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS REASONABLY PRICED CAPITAL TO FUND SUCH INVESTMENTS; 
             
    WE HAVE A CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CURRENT MAXIMUM AVAILABILITY OF   $200.0   MILLION SUBJECT TO OUR HAVING QUALIFIED COLLATERAL, INCLUDING ELIGIBLE CASH, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY THAT VARY IN AMOUNT FROM TIME TO TIME. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING (INCLUDING ISSUING LETTERS OF CREDIT) AT ANY TIME MAY BE LESS THAN   $200.0   MILLION. AT   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  , OUR BORROWING AND LETTER OF CREDIT AVAILABILITY WAS   $116.2   MILLION AND WE HAD USED   $31.8   MILLION OF THAT AMOUNT FOR OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE INCREASED TO   $300.0   MILLION, SUBJECT TO AVAILABLE COLLATERAL AND LENDER PARTICIPATION. HOWEVER, IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY LENDERS WILLING TO INCREASE THEIR COMMITMENTS OR JOIN OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE CREDIT FACILITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS WHEN WE NEED OR WANT TO DO SO;  
                
    WE MAY FINANCE OR SELL UNENCUMBERED REAL ESTATE THAT WE OWN. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE COULD MONETIZE OUR EXISTING REAL ESTATE OR HOW LONG IT MAY TAKE TO DO SO; AND 
                
    WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMDATA HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE ITS AGREEMENTS WITH US, AS COMDATA PURPORTED TO DO BY LETTER DATED NOVEMBER 3, 2016. THESE STATEMENTS IMPLY THAT WE WILL PREVAIL IN OUR CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH COMDATA, OR THAT WE AND COMDATA WILL OTHERWISE RESOLVE THIS DISPUTE AND THAT OUR AGREEMENTS WITH COMDATA WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT WITH NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THEIR TERMS. HOWEVER, OUTCOMES OF CONTRACT DISPUTES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. COMDATA MAY SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE ITS AGREEMENTS WITH US TO INCLUDE HIGHER COSTS TO US OR OTHER TERMS THAT ARE UNFAVORABLE TO US, OR COMDATA MAY STOP SERVICES TO US CAUSING US BUSINESS DISRUPTION OR LOSSES. ALSO, OUR DISPUTE WITH COMDATA MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION. THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND SUCH LITIGATION MAY BE EXPENSIVE AND DISTRACTING TO OUR MANAGEMENT.  
     THESE AND OTHER UNEXPECTED RESULTS MAY BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: 
             
    THE TREND TOWARDS IMPROVED FUEL EFFICIENCY OF MOTOR VEHICLE ENGINES AND OTHER FUEL CONSERVATION PRACTICES BY OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR FUEL AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS; 
                
    COMPETITION WITHIN THE TRAVEL CENTER AND CONVENIENCE STORE INDUSTRIES MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS; 
                
    FUTURE INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES MAY REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE SELL BECAUSE HIGH FUEL PRICES MAY ENCOURAGE FUEL CONSERVATION, DIRECT FREIGHT BUSINESS AWAY FROM TRUCKING OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; 
                
    FUTURE COMMODITY FUEL PRICE INCREASES, FUEL PRICE VOLATILITY OR OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE US TO NEED MORE WORKING CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR INVENTORY AND CARRY OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAN WE NOW EXPECT; 
                
    OUR SUPPLIERS MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT CREDIT TERMS FOR OUR PURCHASES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE GOODS ON REASONABLE CREDIT TERMS, OUR REQUIRED WORKING CAPITAL MAY INCREASE AND WE MAY INCUR MATERIAL LOSSES. ALSO, IN TIMES OF RISING FUEL AND NONFUEL PRICES, OUR SUPPLIERS MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO INCREASE THE CREDIT AMOUNTS THEY EXTEND TO US, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AVAILABILITY AND THE TERMS OF ANY CREDIT WE MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ARE UNCERTAIN; 
                
    ACQUISITIONS OR PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT MAY SUBJECT US TO GREATER RISKS THAN OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF UNKNOWN LIABILITIES;

     Table of Contents  

MOST OF OUR TRUCKING COMPANY CUSTOMERS TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH US BY USE OF FUEL CARDS, MOST OF WHICH ARE ISSUED BY THIRD PARTY FUEL CARD COMPANIES. THE FUEL CARD INDUSTRY HAS ONLY A FEW SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANTS. FUEL CARD COMPANIES FACILITATE PAYMENTS TO US AND CHARGE US FEES FOR THESE SERVICES. COMPETITION, OR LACK THEREOF, AMONG FUEL CARD COMPANIES MAY RESULT IN FUTURE INCREASES IN OUR TRANSACTION FEE EXPENSES OR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR BOTH; 
                
    COMPLIANCE WITH, AND CHANGES TO, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS, TAX RATES, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS AND SIMILAR MATTERS MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITS OR CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED LOSSES; 
                
    WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED IN LITIGATION. DISCOVERY AND COURT DECISIONS DURING LITIGATION OFTEN HAVE UNANTICIPATED RESULTS. LITIGATION IS USUALLY EXPENSIVE AND CAN BE DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THE LITIGATION MATTERS IN WHICH WE ARE OR MAY BECOME INVOLVED; 
                
    ACTS OF TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL RISKS, WARS, OUTBREAKS OF SO CALLED PANDEMICS OR OTHER MANMADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS BEYOND OUR CONTROL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS; AND 
                
    ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE BENEFIT FROM OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RELATED PARTIES, INCLUDING HPT, RMR, AIC AND OTHERS AFFILIATED WITH THEM, ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH RELATED PARTIES MAY PRESENT A CONTRARY PERCEPTION OR RESULT IN LITIGATION. 
     RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE STATED OR IMPLIED BY OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY ALSO BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING UNDER "WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS" AND ITEM 1A. "RISK FACTORS," AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. 
  YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  The disclosure under the headings "Legal Proceedings" and "Environmental Contingencies" in Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  On May 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a final rule, or the Final Rule, regarding exemptions from the laws which require employers to pay overtime wages. The Final Rule currently is effective beginning December 1, 2016. The Final Rule materially increases the amount of salary compensation which must be paid to employees in order for those employees to be exempt from the requirement for overtime wages. To comply with the Final Rule, we expect that we will need to pay some increased amounts of overtime wages, to pay increased salaries to certain employees and possibly to hire additional employees. We currently do not believe these increased costs will be material.   
  Other than the risk factor above, there have been no material changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report to the risk factors previously disclosed under the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report. 

Item 5.  Other Information 
  WEX Inc.     
  On November 5, 2016, we entered into the WEX Merchant Acceptance Agreement, or the WEX Agreement, with WEX Inc., a Delaware corporation, or WEX, pursuant to which we agreed to accept WEX fuel cards for certain purchases for an initial term of sixty months beginning on November 7, 2016, and thereafter automatically renewing for successive twenty-four month terms, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. The WEX Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including: (i) by either party upon six months' notice prior to any scheduled term expiration; (ii) by either party for a material breach that remains uncured following a 30 day cure period; (iii) by either party for bankruptcy related events with respect to the other party; (iv) by us for WEX's non-payment after expiration of specified periods or (v) by WEX upon 180 days' prior notice following certain business combination transactions involving us. 
  Comdata, Inc. 
  Many of our customers use fuel cards issued by Comdata Inc., or Comdata, to make payments to us. On September 12, 2016, we received a letter from Comdata alleging that we were in default under the Comdata Merchant Agreement of December 15, 2010 (as amended on December 14, 2011) by and between Comdata and us, or the Comdata Merchant Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to accept Comdata fuel cards for certain purchases by our customers through January 2, 2022. The September 12, 2016, letter from Comdata alleges default under the Comdata Merchant Agreement due to our purported failure to comply with a separate agreement with Comdata to install radio frequency identification, or RFID, technology at   224   of our company operated travel center locations. In its letter, Comdata threatened to terminate both agreements unless we cured the alleged default on or before October 13, 2016. Although we disputed, and continue to dispute, Comdata's assertions, by letter dated October 13, 2016, we informed Comdata that we had substantially completed installation of the RFID technology, that the technology had been installed and was operational at   201   of our travel center locations, that   one   location had been operational but was damaged and under repair, and that the remaining   22   travel center locations would be outfitted with the RFID technology as soon as we received the required hardware and licenses previously ordered from Comdata. On November 3, 2016, we received a letter from Comdata purporting to terminate both agreements effective immediately and offering to continue the terms of the agreements for up to 90 days. The Comdata Merchant Agreement provides that in the event that either party engages legal counsel to enforce, protect or preserve any rights it might have under such agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and associated costs, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled. We do not believe that Comdata has the right to terminate either of our agreements under the present circumstances and are considering our response.

  ARTICLE VI 
  TAX TREATMENT 
    
  Section 6.1              Tax Treatment of the Company and the Initial Shareholder Prior to the Distribution.   Prior to the time of the Distribution, the Company shall be treated as a disregarded entity for all purposes under the Code pursuant to Section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of the Treasury Regulations.

  Section 6.2              Tax Treatment of the Company and the Shareholders Subsequent to the Distribution.

As a result, all Company items of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit will be treated as tax attributes of the Company, and, for purposes of the Delaware LLC Act, each Shareholder will have no claim on and no right to any such tax attributes of the Company, in the same manner as corporate shareholders under the Code and the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
    
  ARTICLE VII

In addition to the powers that now or hereafter can be granted to managers under the Delaware LLC Act and to all other powers granted under any other provision of this Agreement subject to Section 7.3, the Board of Directors, without Shareholder approval, shall have full power and authority to do, and to direct the Officers to do, all things (and on such terms as it determines to be necessary or appropriate) to conduct the business of the Company, to exercise all powers set forth in Section 2.4 and to effectuate the purposes set forth in Section 2.4, including the following:

(iii)       the acquisition, disposition, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or exchange of any or all of the assets of the Company or the transactions contemplated by Section 14.3(d); 
    
  (iv)       the use of the assets of the Company (including cash on hand) for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the financing of the conduct of the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; the lending of funds to other Persons; and the repayment of obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; 
    
  (v)        the negotiation, execution and performance of any contracts, conveyances or other instruments (including instruments that limit the liability of the Company under contractual arrangements to all or particular assets of the Company); 
    
  (vi)       the distribution of Company cash or other Company assets; 
    
  (vii)      the selection and dismissal of Officers, employees, agents, outside attorneys, accountants, consultants and contractors and the determination of their compensation and other terms of employment or hiring, the creation and operation of employee benefit plans, employee programs and employee practices; 
    
  (viii)     the maintenance of insurance for the benefit of the Company, the Shareholders and the Indemnitees; 
    
  (ix)       the formation of, or acquisition of an interest in, and the contribution of property and the making of loans to, any limited or general partnerships, joint ventures, corporations, limited liability companies or other relationships; 
    
  (x)        the control of any matters affecting the rights and obligations of the Company, including the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation, arbitration or remediation, and the incurring of legal expense and the settlement of claims and litigation; 
    
  (xi)       the indemnification of any Person including, without limitation, as set forth in Article X to the extent permitted by law; 
    
  (xii)      the entering into of listing agreements with any National Securities Exchange and the delisting of some or all of the Shares from, or requesting that trading be suspended on, any such exchange; 
    
  (xiii)     the purchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of securities of the Company, or the issuance of unsecured and secured debt obligations, debt obligations convertible into any class or series of Shares, or any combination of the foregoing, or options, rights, warrants, appreciation rights and other derivative rights relating thereto; and 
    
  (xiv)     the entering into of agreements with any of its Affiliates. 
    
  (b)        The Board of Directors may from time to time determine the number of Directors then constituting the whole Board of Directors,   provided tha  t, effective immediately after the Distribution, such number shall be at least three and no more than seven.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors, by unanimous vote of the Directors then in office, may change the minimum and maximum number of Directors; provided that the Board of Directors shall not decrease the number of Persons that constitutes the whole Board of Directors if such decrease would shorten the term of any Director. 

(c)        Except as may be provided by the Board of Directors in setting the terms of any class or series of Shares, any and all vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors in office, even if the remaining Directors do not constitute a quorum, and any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which such vacancy occurred. 
    
  (d)        Effective upon the Distribution, the Directors (other than any Director subsequently elected solely by holders of one or more classes or series of Shares as specified by the Board of Directors upon the authorization of such Shares) shall be classified into three groups, Group I, Group II and Group III.  The number of Directors in each class shall be as nearly equal in number as possible, as determined by the Board of Directors.  Directors in Group I shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2008; Directors in Group II shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2009; and Directors in Group III shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2010 and, in each such case, until their successors are duly elected or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.  At each annual meeting of the Shareholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose term expires at such meeting shall be elected by the Shareholders to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of Shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors are duly elected. 
    
  (e)        Effective upon the Distribution, three of the Directors shall be  Independent Directors,  as defined below, and the remaining two Directors shall be  Managing Directors.   Independent Directors  shall be those directors who meet the qualifications as independent directors under the applicable rules of each National Securities Exchange on which the Common Shares or other securities of the Company are listed for trading and the Commission from time to time.   Managing Directors  shall mean Directors who are not Independent Directors.  If at any time the Board of Directors shall not be comprised of a majority of Independent Directors, the Board of Directors shall take such actions as will cure such condition, including increasing the size of the Board of Directors and electing one or more Independent Directors; provided that the fact that the Board of Directors does not have a majority of Independent Directors at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Directors. 
    
  (f)        Effective upon the Distribution, the Group I Directors, the Group II Directors and the Group III Directors shall be as specified in a written consent of the Initial Shareholder adopted prior to the Distribution.

  (i)         each member of the Board of Directors shall have one vote; 
    
  (ii)        the presence at a meeting of the Board of Directors of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum at any such meeting (or at any adjournment thereof) for the transaction of business; and 
    
  (iii)       the act of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present shall be deemed to constitute the act of the Board of Directors. 
    
  (i)         Regular meetings of the Board of Directors and any committee thereof shall be held at such times and places as shall be designated from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors or such committee.  Notice of such regular meetings shall not be required.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors or meetings of any committee thereof may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the chairman of such committee, as the case may be, or on the written request of a majority of the Directors then in office or a majority of the committee members then in office, as applicable, to the Secretary, in each case on at least twenty-four hours personal, written, fax or other electronic notice to each Director 

or committee member, which notice may be waived by any Director.  Any such notice, or waiver thereof, need not state the purpose of such meeting except as may otherwise be required by law.  Attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such Director attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or committee.  Members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in and hold a meeting by means of conference telephone, video conference or similar communications equipment by means of which all Persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time, and participation in such meetings shall constitute presence in Person at the meeting. 
    
  (j)         The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors.  The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified Director at any meeting of such committee.  Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in this Agreement, shall have and may exercise all powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: approving or adopting, or recommending to the Shareholders, any action or matter expressly required by this Agreement or the Delaware LLC Act to be submitted to the Shareholders for approval, or adopting, amending or repealing any provision of this Agreement.  The Board of Directors, or, if authorized by the Board in a committee charter or otherwise, the members of any committee may choose a chairman, shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when requested, and, unless the same shall be determined by the Board of Directors, shall fix its own rules or procedures and shall meet at such times and at such place or places as may be provided by such rules.  Unless otherwise required by law or the provisions hereof, 
    
  (i)         each member of a committee shall have one vote; 
    
  (ii)        the presence at a meeting of a committee of a majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum at any such meeting for the transaction of business; and 
    
  (iii)       the act of a majority of the members of a committee present at a meeting of the committee at which a quorum is present shall be deemed to constitute the act of the committee. 
    
  (k)        The Board of Directors may elect one of its members as Chairman of the Board (the    Chairman of the Board   ).  The Chairman of the Board, if any, and if present and acting, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of Shareholders, unless otherwise directed by the Board of Directors.  If the Board of Directors does not elect a Chairman or if the Chairman is absent from the meeting, the Chief Executive Offer, if present and a Director, or any other Director chosen by the Board of Directors, shall preside.  In the absence of a Secretary, the person presiding over the meeting may appoint any Person to serve as secretary of the meeting. 
    
  (l)         Unless otherwise restricted by law, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of the Directors.  The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or paid a stated salary or paid other compensation as Director.  No such payment shall preclude any Director from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.  Directors serving on special or standing committees may also be paid their expenses, if any, of and allowed compensation for attending committee meetings. 
    
  (m)      Subject to the rights of holders of one or more future classes or series of Shares to elect or remove one or more Directors, any Director may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and then only by the unanimous vote of the other Directors then in office.  In addition, subject to the rights of holders of one or more future classes or series of Shares to elect or remove one or more Directors, the entire Board of Directors (but not less than the entire Board 

of Directors) may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and then only by Share Super-Majority Approval.  For the purpose of this paragraph,  cause  shall mean, with respect to any particular Director, incapacity, conviction of a felony or a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holding that such Director caused demonstrable, material harm to the Company through bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty.

To the extent that the Board of Directors determines such action to be necessary or appropriate, the Board of Directors shall direct the appropriate Officers of the Company to file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Formation and do all things to maintain the Company as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Company may elect to do business or own property.  The Company shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Formation, any qualification document or any amendment thereto to any Shareholder.

Such Persons so designated by the Board of Directors shall be referred to as    Officers  .  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement and to the extent permitted by law, as near as practical, the authority, powers, functions and duties (including fiduciary duties) of the Officers shall be identical to the authority, powers, functions and duties (including fiduciary duties) of the officers of a business corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

The Board of Directors may delegate the power of removal as to officers, agents and employees who have not been appointed by the Board of Directors.  Such removal shall be without prejudice to a Person s contract rights, if any, but the appointment of any Person as an Officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not of itself create contract rights. 
    
  (d)        Subject to the control of the Board of Directors and the executive committee (if any) of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer shall have general executive charge, management and control of the properties, business and operations of the Company with all such powers as may be reasonably incident to such responsibilities; he or she may employ and discharge employees and agents of the Company except such as shall be appointed by the Board of Directors, and he or she may delegate these powers; he or she may agree upon and execute all leases, contracts, evidences of indebtedness and other obligations in the name of the Company, and shall have such other powers and duties as designated in accordance with this Agreement and as from time to time may be assigned by the Board of Directors.

In the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of a Vice President to perform the duties of the President, or in the event of his absence or inability or refusal to act, the Vice President who is present and who is senior in terms of uninterrupted time as a Vice President of the Company shall so act.  The Vice President shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the President or the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. 
    
  (h)        The Treasurer shall have responsibility for the custody and control of all the funds and securities of the Company and shall have such other powers and duties as are designated in accordance with this Agreement and as from time to time may be assigned to the Treasurer by the Board of Directors.

  Section 7.4              Outside Activities.    Unless otherwise provided in a written agreement with the Company, notwithstanding any duty (including any fiduciary duty) that might otherwise exist in law or equity, it shall not be a breach of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of any Director for such Director or Affiliates of such Director to engage in outside business interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the Company or in direct competition with the Company;   provided that   no confidential information of the Company may be used by any such Person.

  (a)        Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or required by the Delaware LLC Act, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between any Shareholder or an Affiliate thereof, and/or one or more Directors or their respective Affiliates and/or the Company, any resolution or course of action by the Board of Directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Shareholders, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, including any fiduciary duty, if the resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by a Share Plurality (with interested Shareholders not counted for any purpose), or (ii) on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair and reasonable to the Company, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Company).

  Section 7.8              Reliance by Third Parties.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Company shall be entitled to assume that the Board of Directors and any Officer authorized by the Board of Directors to act on behalf of and in the name of the Company has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the Company and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the Company, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the Board of Directors or any Officer as if it were the Company s sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially.

     Person    shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1.1 and also includes a group as that term is used for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the term  Person  shall not include any  group  as that term is used for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, if such  group  would be an Excluded Holder (but any Person that is a member of such  group  shall still be considered to be a  Person  for purposes hereof). 
    
     Prohibited Owner    shall mean any Person who, but for the provisions of Section 8.2(a), would Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Ownership Limitation, and if appropriate in the context, shall also mean any Person who would have been the Record Holder of Shares that the Prohibited Owner would have so owned. 
    
     Transfer    shall mean any issuance, sale, transfer, gift, assignment, devise or other disposition, as well as any other event (or any agreement to take any such actions or cause any such events) that causes any Person to acquire Constructive Ownership of Shares or the right to vote or receive distributions on Shares, including without limitation, (a) the transfer of Shares to holders of common shares of HPT in the Distribution, (b) any change in the capital structure of the Company which has the effect of increasing the total equity interest of any Person in the Company, (c) a change in the relationship between two or more Persons which causes a change in ownership of Shares by application of Section 318(a) of the Code, as modified by Section 856(d)(5) of the Code, (d) the grant or exercise of any option or warrant (or any disposition of any option or warrant, or any event that causes any option or warrant not theretofore exercisable to become exercisable), pledge, security interest or similar right to acquire Shares, (e) any disposition of any securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for Shares or any interest in Shares or any exercise of any such conversion or exchange right, and (f) transfers of interests in other entities that result in changes in Constructive Ownership of Shares, in each case, whether voluntary or involuntary, whether owned of record or Constructively Owned, and whether by operation of law or otherwise.  The terms  Transferring  and  Transferred  shall have the correlative meanings. 
    
  Section 8.2              Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of Shares. 
    
  (a)          Ownership Limitations  .  Commencing on the Distribution Date: 
    
  (i)            Basic Restrictions.    (A) No Person, other than an Excepted Holder or an Excluded Holder, shall Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit, (B) no Excepted Holder shall Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder, and (C) no Excluded Holder shall Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Excluded Holder Limit for such Excluded Holder. 
    
  (ii)          Transfer in Trust.    If any Transfer of Shares occurs (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of a National Securities Exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) which, if effective, would result in any Person Constructively Owning Shares in violation of Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or 8.2(a)(i)(C), as applicable; (x) then that number of Shares the Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or 8.2(a)(i)(C) (rounded upward to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Charitable Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 8.3, effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer (or as of the close of business on the Distribution Date as to any  

such Transfer that occurs on the Distribution Date), and such Person shall acquire no rights in such Shares; or (y) if the transfer to the Charitable Trust described in clause (x) of this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or 8.2(a)(i)(C), as applicable, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Transfer of that number of Shares that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or 8.2(a)(i)(C), as applicable, shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. 
    
  (b)          Remedies for Breach  .  If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall at any time determine that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section 8.2(a)(i) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Constructive Ownership of any Shares in violation of Section 8.2(a)(i) (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem Shares, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event (and such Person shall be liable, without limitation, for all costs incurred in connection therewith and pursuant to Section 10.3);   provided, however  , that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 8.2(a)(i) shall automatically result in the transfer to the Charitable Trust described above, and, where applicable under Section 8.2(a)(ii)(y) such Transfer (or other event) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. 
    
  (c)          Notice of Restricted Transfer.    Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Constructive Ownership of Shares that will or may violate Section 8.2(a)(i), or any Person who would have owned Shares that resulted in a transfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2(a)(ii)(x), shall immediately give written notice to the Company of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice, and shall provide to the Company such other information as the Company may request. 
    
  (d)          Owners Required to Provide Information.    Commencing on the Distribution Date, every Shareholder of record of more than five percent of the Outstanding Shares of any series or class, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year and also within 30 days after a request from the Company, shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of Shares owned, and a description of the manner in which such Shares are held;   provided that   a Shareholder of record who holds Outstanding Shares as nominee for another Person, which other Person is required to include in gross income the distributions received on such Shares (an    Actual Owner   ), shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such Actual Owner and the number of Shares of such Actual Owner with respect to which the Shareholder of record is nominee.  Each such Shareholder of record and each Actual Owner shall provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to ensure compliance with the Ownership Limit. 
    
  (e)          Ambiguity.    In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 or any definition contained in Section 8.1, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 with respect to any situation based upon the facts known to it.  If Section 8.2 or 8.3 requires an action by the Board of Directors and this Agreement does not contain a specific provision authorizing such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 8.1, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3. 
    
  (f)          Exceptions  . 
    
  (i)    The Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), may grant to any Person who makes a request therefor (a    Requesting Person   ) an exception to the Ownership Limit (or one or more elements thereof) with respect to the ownership of any series or class of Shares, subject to the following conditions and 

limitations: (A) (1) the Board of Directors shall have determined, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), that the Requesting Person s ownership of Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit pursuant to the exception requested hereunder (together with the ownership of Shares by all other Persons as permitted under this Article VIII, taking into account any previously granted exceptions pursuant hereto) would not cause a default under the terms of any contract to which the Company is a party or reasonably expects to become a party and (2) the Board of Directors shall have determined, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), and in the case of each individual Director, in his business judgment, that the Requesting Person s ownership of Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit pursuant to the exception requested hereunder (together with the ownership of Shares by all other Persons as permitted under this Article VIII, taking into account any previously granted exceptions pursuant hereto) is in the best interests of the Company; and (B) such Requesting Person provides to the Board of Directors, for the benefit of the Company, such representations and undertakings, if any, as the Board of Directors may, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), determine to be necessary in order for it to make the determination that the conditions set forth in clause (A) above of this Section 8.2(f)(i) have been and/or will continue to be satisfied (including, without limitation, an agreement as to a reduced Ownership Limit or Excepted Holder Limit for such Requesting Person with respect to the Constructive Ownership of one or more other classes or series of Shares not subject to the exception), and such Requesting Person agrees that any violation of such representations and undertakings or any attempted violation thereof will result in the application of the remedies set forth in Section 8.2(b) with respect to Shares held in excess of the Ownership Limit or the Excepted Holder Limit (as may be applicable) with respect to such Requesting Person (determined without regard to the exception granted such Requesting Person under this subparagraph (i)).  If a member of the Board of Directors requests that the Board of Directors grant an exception pursuant to this subsection (f) with respect to such member, or with respect to any other Person if such member of the Board of Directors would be considered to be the Constructive Owner of Shares owned by such other Person, such member of the Board of Directors shall not participate in the decision of the Board of Directors as to whether to grant any such exception. 
    
  (ii)   In determining whether to grant any exemption pursuant to Section 8.2(f)(i), the Board of Directors may, but need not, consider, among other factors, (A) the general reputation and moral character of the Requesting Person, (B) whether ownership of Shares would be direct or through ownership attribution, (C) whether the Requesting Person s ownership of Shares would interfere with the conduct of the Company s business, (D) whether granting an exemption for the Requesting Person would adversely affect any of the Company s existing contractual arrangements, and (E) whether the Requesting Person to whom the exemption would apply is attempting to change control of the Company or affect its policies in a way which the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), considers adverse to the best interest of the Company or the Shareholders.  Nothing in this Section 8.2(f)(ii) shall be interpreted to mean that the Board of Directors may not act in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty) in making any determination under Section 8.2(f)(i). 
    
  (iii)  An underwriter or initial purchaser that participates in a public offering or a private placement of Shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) may Constructively Own Shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) in excess of the Ownership Limit, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public offering or private placement as determined by the Board of Directors. 

(iv)  The Board of Directors may reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder only: (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. 
    
  (v)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, any determination made by the Board of Directors with respect to the provisions of Section 8.2(f) may be made without regard to any fiduciary or other duties that the Board of Directors may have to the Prohibited Owner or any other Person. 
    
  (g)          Increase or Decrease in Ownership Limit.    The Board of Directors may from time to time increase or decrease the Ownership Limit, provided that any decrease may be made only prospectively as to subsequent holders (other than a decrease as a result of a retroactive change in existing law, in which case such change shall be effective immediately). 
    
  (h)          Legend  .  Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, each certificate for Shares (or securities exercisable for or convertible into Shares) shall bear a legend with respect to the restrictions contained in this Agreement in such form as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors.  Instead of the foregoing legend, the certificate may state that the Company will furnish a full statement about certain restrictions on transferability to a Shareholder on request and without charge. 
    
  (i)           No Recourse  .  A Prohibited Owner shall have no claim, cause of action or other recourse whatsoever against the purported transferor of Shares causing the violation of the restrictions set forth in Section 8.2(a). 
    
  Section 8.3              Transfer of Shares. 
    
  (a)          Ownership in Trust.    Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 8.2(a)(ii) that would result in a transfer of Shares to a Charitable Trust, such Shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee as trustee of a Charitable Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3(e)).  Such transfer to the Charitable Trustee shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to any other purported Transfer or other event that otherwise results in the transfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii) (or as of the close of business on the Distribution Date if such other purported Transfer or other event occurs on that date).  The Charitable Trustee shall be appointed by the Company and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the Company and any Prohibited Owner.  Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the Company as provided in Section 8.3(g). 
    
  (b)          Status of Shares Held by the Charitable Trustee.    Shares held by the Charitable Trustee shall be issued and Outstanding Shares of the Company.  The Prohibited Owner shall (i) have no rights in the Shares held by the Charitable Trustee; (ii) not benefit economically from ownership of any Shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3(e)); (iii) have no rights to dividends or other distributions; (iv) not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the Shares held in the Charitable Trust; and (v) have no claim, cause of action or other recourse whatsoever against the purported transferor of such Shares. 
    
  (c)          Dividend and Voting Rights  .  The Charitable Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect to Shares held in the Charitable Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3(e)).  Any dividend or other distribution paid prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee shall be paid with respect to such Shares to the Charitable Trustee by the Prohibited Owner upon demand and any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Charitable Trustee.  Any dividends or distributions so paid over to the Charitable Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable Beneficiary.  The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to Shares held in the Charitable Trust and, effective as of the date that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, the Charitable Trustee shall have the authority (at the Charitable Trustee s sole 

discretion) (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee and (ii) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Charitable Trustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; provided, however, that if the Company has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Charitable Trustee shall not have the power to rescind and recast such vote.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, until the Company has received notification that Shares have been transferred into a Charitable Trust, the Company shall be entitled to rely on its stock transfer and other Shareholder records for purposes of preparing lists of Shareholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and authority of proxies, and otherwise conducting votes of Shareholders. 
    
  (d)          Rights upon Liquidation.    Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets of the Company, the Charitable Trustee shall be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of Shares of the class or series of Shares that is held in the Charitable Trust, that portion of the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of such class or series (determined based upon the ratio that the number of Shares of such class or series of Shares held by the Charitable Trustee bears to the total number of Shares of such class or series of Shares then outstanding).  The Charitable Trustee shall distribute any such assets received in respect of the Shares held in the Charitable Trust in any liquidation, dissolution or winding up or distribution of the assets of the Company, in accordance with Section 8.3(e). 
    
  (e)          Sale of Shares by Charitable Trustee  . 
    
  (i)    Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, the Charitable Trustee shall sell the Shares held in the Charitable Trust (together with the right to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to such Shares as to any Shares transferred to the Charitable Trustee as a result of the operation of Section 8.2(a)(ii)) to a Person, designated by the Charitable Trustee, whose ownership of the Shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i).  Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate and the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section 8.3(e). 
    
  (ii)   A Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (1) the net price paid by the Prohibited Owner for the Shares or, if the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the Shares in connection with the event causing the Shares to be held in the Charitable Trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the Market Price of the Shares on the day of the event causing the Shares to be held in the Charitable Trust, and (2) the net sales proceeds received by the Charitable Trustee from the sale or other disposition of the Shares held in the Charitable Trust.  Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.  If, prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, such Shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (i) such Shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Charitable Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such Shares that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 8.3(e), such excess shall be paid to the Charitable Trustee upon demand. 
    
  (f)           Purchase Right in Shares Transferred to Trustee.    Shares transferred to the Charitable Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Company, or its designee, at a price per Share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per Share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Charitable Trust (or, in the case of a devise, gift or other such transaction, the Market Price per such Share on the day of the event causing the Shares to be held in the Charitable Trust) and (ii) the Market Price per such Share on the date the Company, or its designee, accepts such offer.  The Company shall have the right to accept such offer until the Charitable Trustee has sold the Shares held in the Charitable Trust pursuant to Section 8.3(e).  Upon such a sale to the Company, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate and the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in Section 8.3(e). 

(g)          Designation of Charitable Beneficiaries.    By written notice to the Charitable Trustee, the Company shall designate from time to time one or more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest in the Charitable Trust such that (i) Shares held in the Charitable Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i) in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary and (ii) contributions to each such organization must be eligible for deduction under each of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code. 
    
  Section 8.4               Transactions on a National Securities Exchange.    Nothing in this Article VIII shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of a National Securities Exchange or any automated inter-dealer quotation system.  The fact that the settlement of any transaction takes place shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this Article VIII and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article VIII. 
    
  Section 8.5               Enforcement.    The Company is authorized specifically to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this Article VIII (and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a Person shall be liable, without limitation, for all costs incurred in connection therewith and pursuant to Section 10.3). 
    
  Section 8.6               Non-Waiver.    No delay or failure on the part of the Company or the Board of Directors in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Company or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, except to the extent specifically waived in writing. 
    
  Section 8.7              Enforceability.    If any of the restrictions on transfer of Shares contained in this Article VIII are determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Prohibited Owner may be deemed, at the option of the Company, to have acted as an agent of the Company in acquiring such Shares and to hold such Shares on behalf of the Company. 
    
  ARTICLE IX 
  VOTING RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS; MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
    
  Section 9.1               General. 
    
  (a)        The provisions of this Article IX shall be subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act and any applicable Exchange Rule.  If, in the Opinion of Counsel, any of such provisions are inconsistent with such requirements, such requirements shall supersede the provisions of this Agreement and the Board of Directors shall amend the provisions of this Article IX so as to make its provisions consistent with such requirements. 
    
  (b)        Any matter, including the nomination of Directors, submitted by the Board of Directors to the Shareholders for approval, and any matter otherwise voted upon by the Shareholders and subject to the provisions of Section 5.5 (relating to the creation of new classes and series of Shares) and Section 7.1(m) (relating to the removal of Directors by the Shareholders), shall require the following vote by the Shareholders for approval: (i) the election of Directors nominated by the Board of Directors, a Share Majority; (ii) any other matter that has been approved previously by the Board of Directors, a Share Plurality; and (iii) any matter that has not been approved previously by the Board of Directors, a Share Super-Majority Approval.  There shall not be cumulative voting of Common Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1(b), the election of a Managing Director or an Independent Director in an uncontested election (which, for purposes of this Agreement, is an election in which the number of nominees for election equals or is less than the number to be elected at a meeting) shall require the vote of a plurality of the Outstanding Shares with voting power voting at a meeting of Shareholders.  
    
  (c)        All meetings of Shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the Company or at such other place as shall be set by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  For purposes of determining the Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Shareholders, the Board of Directors may set a Record 

Date.  If no Record Date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the Record Date for determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given.  A determination of Shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall apply to any adjournment or postponement of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new Record Date for the adjourned or postponed meeting. 
    
  (d)        An annual meeting of the Shareholders shall be called by the Board of Directors and shall be held on a date and at the time set by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors shall cause at least 30 days  notice to be given of an annual meeting of Shareholders. 
    
  (e)        The Chairman of the Board, if any, or a majority of the entire Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the Shareholders.  Subject to subsection (f) and the last sentence of this subsection (e), a special meeting of Shareholders shall also be called by the Secretary of the Company upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting.  The    Special Meeting Percentage    shall be a majority or, to the extent permitted by any applicable Exchange Rule, such higher percentage as shall be specified from time to time by the Board of Directors;   provided, however  , that in no case shall the Special Meeting Percentage be more than 75%.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to permit the Shareholders to cause a special meeting of the Shareholders to be called unless applicable law or Exchange Rule requires that the Shareholders be able to do so. 
    
  (f)         Subject to the last sentence of subsection (e), any Shareholder of record seeking to have Shareholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary (the    Record Date Request Notice   ) by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date to determine the Shareholders entitled to request a special meeting (the    Request Record Date   ).  No Shareholder may make a Record Date Request Notice unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s written request to the Secretary, as described in the preceding sentence, in order for such request to be effective;   provided, however  , that the provisions of this sentence shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them.  The Record Date Request Notice shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, shall be signed by one or more Shareholders of record as of the date of signature (or their duly authorized agents), shall bear the date of signature of each such Shareholder (or other agent) and shall set forth all information relating to each such Shareholder that must be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act.  Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors may fix a Request Record Date and may also fix the Special Meeting Percentage for that meeting.  The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  If the Board of Directors, within ten days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the Request Record Date and make a public announcement of such Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business on the tenth day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the Secretary. 
    
  (g)        Subject to the last sentence of subsection (e), in order for any Shareholder to request a special meeting, one or more written requests for a special meeting (the    Special Meeting Request   ) signed by Shareholders of record (or their duly authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall be delivered to the Secretary.  No Shareholder may make a Special Meeting Request unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s written request to the Secretary, as described in the preceding sentence, in order for such request to be effective;   provided, however  , that the provisions of this sentence shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them.  In addition, the Special Meeting Request shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it (which shall be limited to the matters set forth in the Record Date Request 
  Notice received by the Secretary), shall bear the date of signature of each such Shareholder (or other agent) signing the  

Special Meeting Request, shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Company s books, of each Shareholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed) and the class and number of Shares of the Company which are owned of record and beneficially by each such Shareholder, shall be sent to the Secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested, and must be received by the Secretary within 60 days after the Request Record Date.  Any requesting Shareholder may revoke his request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary. 
    
  (h)        The Secretary shall inform the requesting Shareholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of meeting (including the Company s proxy materials).  The Secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon Shareholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the written requests required by subsection (g), the Secretary receives payment from the requesting Shareholders of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the mailing of any notice of the meeting. 
    
  (i)         Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Officer who called the meeting, if any, and otherwise by the Board of Directors.  In the case of any special meeting called by the Secretary upon the request of Shareholders (a    Shareholder Requested Meeting   ), such meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors;   provided, however  , that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received by the Secretary (the    Delivery Date   ), a date and time for a Shareholder Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m., local time on the 90(th) day after the record date for such Shareholder Requested Meeting (the    Meeting Record Date   ) or, if such 90(th) day is not a Business Day, on the first preceding Business Day; and   provided further   that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Shareholder Requested Meeting within ten days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive offices of the Company.  In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.  In the case of any Shareholder Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30(th) day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date. 
    
  (j)         If at any time as a result of written revocations of requests for the special meeting, Shareholders of record (or their duly authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall have delivered and not revoked requests for a special meeting, the Secretary may refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting or, if the notice of the meeting has been mailed, the Secretary may revoke the notice of the meeting at any time not less than ten days before the meeting if the Secretary has first sent to all other requesting Shareholders written notice of such revocation and of intention to revoke the notice of the meeting.  Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of a notice of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special meeting. 
    
  (k)        The Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors may appoint regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the Company for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any Special Meeting Request received by the Secretary.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such request shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Secretary until the earlier of (i) five Business Days after receipt by the Secretary of such request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the Secretary has validly received requests signed by Record Holders (or their duly authorized agents) entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting to be called pursuant to such requests.  Nothing contained in this subsection (k) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Company or any Shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). 

Section 9.2               Notice.    If and to the extent required by law, the Secretary shall give to each Shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting and to each Shareholder not entitled to vote who is entitled to notice of the meeting written notice stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the purpose for which the meeting is called, either by mail, by recognized national courier service, by presenting it to such Shareholder personally, by leaving it at the Shareholder s residence or usual place of business or by any other means, including electronic delivery, permitted by the Delaware LLC Act, the Exchange Act and any applicable Exchange Rule.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the Shareholder at the Shareholder s address as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid.  No business shall be transacted at a Shareholder Requested Meeting except as specifically designated in the notice. 
    
  Section 9.3               Quorum; Organization and Conduct. 
    
  (a)         Quorum.    A quorum for action at an annual or special meeting of Shareholders shall be the holders, present in person or by proxy, of a majority of the Outstanding Shares entitled to vote at the meeting;   provided, however  , that a quorum for the approval of any proposal that requires a Share Separate Class Approval or a Share Super-Majority Approval shall be the holders of that number of each class and series of Shares required to approve the proposal in question. 
    
  (b)          Organization and Conduct  .  Every meeting of Shareholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment, by the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or, in the case of the absence of the Chairman of the Board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting: the Vice Chairman of the Board, if there be one, the President, the Vice Presidents in their order of rank and seniority, or, in the absence of such officers, a chairman chosen by the Shareholders by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by Shareholders present in person or by proxy.  The Secretary, or, in the Secretary s absence, an Assistant Secretary, or in the absence of both the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries, a person appointed by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such appointment, a person appointed by the chairman of the meeting shall act as Secretary.  In the event that the Secretary presides at a meeting of the Shareholders, an Assistant Secretary shall record the minutes of the meeting.  The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of Shareholders shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting.  The chairman of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to Shareholders of record of the Company, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to Shareholders of record of the Company entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (f) removing any Shareholder who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairman of the meeting; and (g) recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and place announced at the meeting.  Unless otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, meetings of Shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure or any established rules of order.  If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Shareholders, the chairman of the meeting or the Shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall have the authority to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a specified date without notice other than announcement at the meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  The Shareholders present either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has been duly called and convened, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Shareholders to leave less than a quorum. 
    
  Section 9.4               Proxies.    A Shareholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by the Shares owned of record by the Shareholder in person or by proxy granted by the Shareholder or by the Shareholder s duly authorized agent in 

writing, by any means permitted by the Board of Directors or in any manner required by law.  Such proxy or evidence of authorization of such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Company before or at the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months after its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy. 
    
  Section 9.5               Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. 
    
  (a)        For all purposes of this Agreement, Shares registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock.  For all purposes of this Agreement, any director or other fiduciary may vote stock registered in his name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.  Shares directly or indirectly owned by the Company shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of Outstanding Shares entitled to be voted at any given time, unless they are held by it in a fiduciary capacity, in which case they may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of Outstanding Shares at any given time. 
    
  (b)        The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure by which a Shareholder may certify in writing to the Company that any Shares registered in the name of the Shareholder are held for the account of a specified person other than the Shareholder.  The resolution shall set forth the class of Shareholders who may make the certification, the purpose for which the certification may be made, the form of certification and the information to be contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a record date or closing of the stock transfer books, the time after the record date or closing of the stock transfer books within which the certification must be received by the Company; and any other provisions with respect to the procedure which the Board of Directors considers necessary or desirable.  On receipt of such certification, the person specified in the certification shall be regarded as, for the purposes set forth in the certification, the Shareholder of record of the specified stock in place of the Shareholder who makes the certification. 
    
  Section 9.6               Inspectors.    The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more individual inspectors or one or more entities that designate individuals as inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If an inspector or inspectors are not appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors.  In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting.  The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of Shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all Shareholders.  Each such report shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of Shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be   prima facie   evidence thereof. 
    
  Section 9.7               Advance Notice of Shareholder Nominees for Director and Other Shareholder Proposals. 
    
  (a)        Annual Meetings of Shareholders.

In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement of the mailing of notice for such annual meeting or of an adjournment of an annual meeting to a later date or time commence a new time period for the giving of Shareholder s notice as described above.  No Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary described in this Section 9.7(a)(2) unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s notice to the Secretary in order for such notice to be effective;   provided, however  , that (x) the provisions of this sentence and clause (A) of Section 9.7(a)(1)(ii) shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them, and (y) if clause (x) of this proviso is applicable, no Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary described in this Section 9.7(a)(2) unless such Shareholder is, at the time of giving such notice and through and including the time of the annual meeting, a Shareholder of record of all Shares owned by such Shareholder.

  For the purposes of this Section 9.7,  Shareholder Associated Person  of any Shareholder shall mean (i) any Person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such Shareholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of Common Shares or other securities issued by the Company owned of record or beneficially by such Shareholder and (iii) any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person. 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 9.7(a)(2) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of notice for the preceding year s annual meeting, a Shareholder s notice required by this Section 9.7 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company. 
    
  (b)          Shareholder Proposals Causing Covenant Breaches.    At the same time as or prior to the submission of any Shareholder proposal of business to be conducted at an annual or special meeting that, if approved and implemented by the Company, would cause the Company to be in breach of any covenant of the Company in any existing or proposed debt instrument of the Company or agreement of the Company with any lender, the proponent Shareholder or Shareholders must submit to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company (i) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the lender s willingness to waive the breach of covenant or (ii) a plan for repayment of the indebtedness to the lender and the payment of all related interest, prepayment premiums, breakage costs and other amounts due and payable in connection with such repayment satisfactory to the Board of Directors, specifically identifying the source of funds to be used in the repayment and related payments and presenting evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors that the identified funds could be applied by the Company to the repayment. 
    
  (c)          Shareholder Proposals Requiring Regulatory Notice, Consent or Approval.

  (d)          Special Meetings of Shareholders  .  Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of Shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company s notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may only be made at a special meeting of Shareholders at which directors are to be elected: (i) pursuant to the Company s notice of meeting for a meeting called by the Chairman or the Board of Directors by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such special meeting, by any Shareholder of the Company (A) who holds, at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 9.7(d) and through and including the time of the special meeting, a Certificate evidencing such Shareholder s ownership of all Shares owned by such Shareholder, (B) who is entitled to vote at the meeting and present in person or by proxy at the meeting to answer questions concerning the nomination or business and (C) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.7(d).  If, pursuant to the request of the Chairman, the President or a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, the Company calls a special meeting of Shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such Shareholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company s notice of meeting, if the Shareholder s notice contains the information required by Section 9.7(a)(2) and the notice has been delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the later of (x) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or (y) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of a special meeting to a later date or time commence a new time period for the giving of a Shareholder s notice as described above.  No Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary provided for in this Section 9.7(d) unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s notice to the Secretary in order for such 

notice to be effective; provided, however, that (x) the provisions of this sentence and clause (A) of Section 9.7(d)(ii) shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them, and (y) if clause (x) of this proviso is applicable, no Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary described in this Section 9.7(d) unless such Shareholder is, at the time of giving such notice and through and including the time of the special meeting, a Shareholder of record of all Shares owned by such Shareholder.   
    
  (e)          General.    (1) Upon written request by the Secretary or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, any Shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a director or any proposal for other business at a meeting of Shareholders shall provide, within three business days of delivery of such request (or such other period as may be specified in such request), written verification, satisfactory to the Secretary or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, in his, her or its sole discretion, of the accuracy of any information submitted by the Shareholder pursuant to this Section 9.7.  If a Shareholder fails to provide such written verification within such period, the Secretary or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may treat the information as to which written verification was requested as not having been provided in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7. 
    
  (2) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business as shall have been brought before the meeting with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7 shall be transacted at a meeting of Shareholders.  The chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination proposed to be made or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made at or brought before the meeting, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 9.7, to declare that such nomination or business is out of order and should be disregarded. 
    
  (3) For purposes of this Section 9.7, (a) the  date of mailing of the notice  shall mean the date of the proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies for election of directors and (b)  public announcement  shall mean disclosure (i) in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable news service or (ii) in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Commission. 
    
  (4) The Company shall not be required to include in the Company s proxy statement a Shareholder nomination of one or more persons for election to the Board of Directors unless (i) such nomination has been properly made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.7 and (ii) the Board of Directors has endorsed such nomination.  The Company shall not be required to include in the Company s proxy statement a Shareholder proposal other than a Board of Directors nomination unless (i) such proposal has been properly made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.7 and (ii) either the Board of Directors has endorsed such proposal or the proposal has been made by Shareholders holding not less than 25% of the Shares required to approve the proposal (or such lesser percentage as may be required by law).  In addition, the Company shall not be required to include in the Company s proxy statement a Shareholder proposal of business to be brought before an annual or special meeting of Shareholders unless the proponent Shareholder or Shareholders shall have complied with (i) all applicable requirements of state and federal law and the rules and regulations thereunder, including without limitation Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the applicable procedures and other requirements set forth in this Section 9.7.  Nothing in this Section 9.7 shall be deemed to affect any right of the Company to omit a Shareholder proposal from the Company s proxy statement under the Exchange Act, including without limitation nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and business to be brought before the Shareholders at an annual or special meeting of Shareholders.  A Shareholder proposal properly made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.7 shall be considered at the meeting with respect to which it was made even if such proposal does not appear in the Company s proxy statement for that meeting.   
    
  (5) The Board of Directors may from time to time require any person nominated to serve on the Board of Directors to agree in writing with regard to matters of business ethics and confidentiality while such nominee serves as a Director, such agreement to be on the terms and in a form determined satisfactory by the Board of Directors, as amended and supplemented from time to time in the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The terms of such agreement may be 

substantially similar to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics of the Company or any similar code promulgated by the Company or may differ from or supplement such Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or other code. 
    
  Section 9.8               Actions of Shareholders by Written Consent.     Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of Shareholders may be taken without a meeting only by a unanimous written consent of the Shareholders entitled to vote on the matter which sets forth the action.  
    
  ARTICLE X 
  INDEMNIFICATION 
    
  Section 10.1             Indemnification. 
    
  (a)        To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement or in any Bylaws of the Company, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether or not by or in the right of the Company, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, in connection with any act or omission performed, or omitted to be performed, by such Indemnitee in good faith on behalf of or with respect to the Company or by reason of its status as an Indemnitee;   provided that   the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 10.1, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct, or in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. 
    
  (b)        To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 10.1 in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Company prior to a determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Company of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 10.1. 
    
  (c)        The indemnification, advancement of expenses and other provisions of this Section 10.1 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter, pursuant to a vote of the Board of Directors, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 
    
  (d)        The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of its Directors and Officers, and such other Persons as the Board of Directors shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Company s activities or such Person s activities on behalf of the Company, regardless of whether the Company would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise. 
    
  (e)        For purposes of the definition of Indemnitee in Section 1.1, the Company shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by such Indemnitee of his or her duties to the Company also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such Indemnitee to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute  fines  within the meaning of this Section 10.1; and action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of such Indemnitee s duties for 

a purpose reasonably believed by him or her to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company. 
    
  (f)         Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall be made only out of the assets of the Company, it being agreed that the Shareholders shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Company to enable it to effectuate such indemnification. 
    
  (g)        An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 10.1 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement or applicable law.

  ARTICLE V 
  ISSUANCE OF SHARES 
    
  Section 5.1              Issuance to Initial Shareholder.     Pursuant to the Original LLC Agreement, the Company issued one Common Share to the Initial Shareholder.  The Initial Shareholder owns 1 Common Share at the time of the execution of this Agreement, representing all of the issued and outstanding Shares.  Immediately prior to the Distribution on the Distribution Date, the Company will automatically be deemed to issue or have issued to the Initial Shareholder (which will continue to be a member of the Company through completion of the Distribution) such additional Common Shares so that the total number of Common Shares held by the Initial Shareholder will be equal to the number of Common Shares required to be distributed pursuant to the Transaction Agreement.  Upon completion of the Distribution and immediately following the admission of at least one Shareholder as a member of the Company in connection therewith, the Initial Shareholder shall cease to be a member of the Company. 
    
  Unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors, no interest shall be paid by the Company on the capital contributions of any Shareholder, and no Shareholder shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its capital contribution. 
    
  Section 5.2              Rights of Holders of Common Shares. 
    
  (a)        The only class or series of Shares authorized and Outstanding on the date of this Agreement is the Common Shares.  All preferences, voting powers, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges, and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the Common Shares are expressly made subject and subordinate to those that may be fixed by the Board of Directors with respect to any additional classes or series of Shares. 
    
  (b)        Except as otherwise required by law or this Agreement and subject to the preferential rights of any additional classes or series of Shares authorized by the Board of Directors, each holder of Common Shares shall have one vote in respect of each Common Share held by such Shareholder of record on the books of the Company on all matters submitted to a vote of Shareholders. 
    
  (c)        Subject to the preferential rights of any additional classes or series of Shares authorized by the Board of Directors, the holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company, out of the assets of the Company which are by law available therefor, distributions payable either in cash, in property or in securities of the Company. 
    
  (d)        In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, after satisfaction (whether by payment or reasonable provision for payment) of creditors of the Company and after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of other securities of the Company, the holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive (with or without participation of the holders of other securities of the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors at the time of authorization of such securities) all of the remaining assets of the Company of whatever kind available for distribution to the holders of the Common Shares ratably in proportion to the number of Common Shares by them unless otherwise provided by law. 
    
  Section 5.3              Issuances of Additional Company Securities.

  (b)        Additional Shares authorized to be issued by the Company pursuant to Section 5.3(a) may be authorized and/or issued in one or more classes or series, with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing classes and series of Shares or other securities of the Company), as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and reflected in a written action or actions approved by the Board of Directors in compliance with Section 7.1(i) (each, a    Share Designation   ), including (i) the right to share in Company distributions; (ii) the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Company; (iii) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Company may redeem such class or series of Shares; (iv) whether such class or series of Shares is issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange; (v) the terms and conditions upon which each class or series of Shares will be issued, evidenced (or not evidenced) by certificates and assigned or transferred; and (vii) the right, if any, of each such class or series of Shares to vote on Company matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such class or series of Shares.  A Share Designation (or any resolution of the Board of Directors amending any Share Designation) shall be effective when a duly executed (executed in accordance with Section 7.1(i)) original of the same is delivered to the Secretary of the Company for inclusion among the permanent records of the Company.  For the avoidance of doubt, any securities of the Company, in addition to additional classes or series of Shares, may be issued on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may determine. 
    
  (c)        The Board of Directors shall take all actions that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Shares and other securities of the Company, unsecured and secured debt obligations, debt obligations convertible into any class or series of Shares, or any combination of the foregoing, and options, rights, warrants, appreciation rights and other derivative rights relating to securities, issued pursuant to this Section 5.3; (ii) the admission of additional Shareholders; and (iii) all additional issuances of securities by the Company.  The Board of Directors shall determine the relative designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Shares or other securities being so issued.  The Board of Directors shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware LLC Act and is authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of securities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National Securities Exchange on which the Common Shares or other securities of the Company are listed for trading. 
    
  Section 5.4              No Preemptive Rights.    No Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any securities of the Company, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter created. 
    
  Section 5.5              Rights of Additional Classes and Series of Shares.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the voting and other rights of a particular class or series of Shares are subject to the voting and other rights of any class or series of Shares designated by the Board of Directors. 
    
  Section 5.6              Splits and Combinations. 
    
  (a)        The Company may make a Pro Rata distribution of securities to all Record Holders of one or more classes or series of Shares, or may effect a subdivision or combination of any class or series of Shares. 
    
  (b)        Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination is declared, the Board of Directors shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof to each applicable Record Holder thereof in compliance with all applicable laws and rules of any National Securities Exchange on which the Common Shares or other securities of the Company are listed for trading. 
    
  (c)        Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the Company shall not issue fractional Shares upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Shares.  If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Shares would result in the issuance of fractional Shares but for the contrary provisions hereof, then unless otherwise determined  

by the Board of Directors, each fractional Share shall be rounded to the nearest whole Share (and a 0.5 Share shall be rounded to the next higher Share). 
    
  Section 5.7              Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Shares.     All Shares issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Article V shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Shares of the Company, except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement or a Share Designation. 
    
  ARTICLE VI 
  TAX TREATMENT 
    
  Section 6.1              Tax Treatment of the Company and the Initial Shareholder Prior to the Distribution.   Prior to the time of the Distribution, the Company shall be treated as a disregarded entity for all purposes under the Code pursuant to Section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of the Treasury Regulations.  The Initial Shareholder intends that no action be taken to treat the Company as a corporation under the Code prior to the Distribution. 
    
  Section 6.2              Tax Treatment of the Company and the Shareholders Subsequent to the Distribution.    Subsequent to the Distribution, pursuant to Section 7704 of the Code, the Company will be a publicly traded partnership and be treated as if it were a corporation for all purposes under the Code.  As a result, all Company items of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit will be treated as tax attributes of the Company, and, for purposes of the Delaware LLC Act, each Shareholder will have no claim on and no right to any such tax attributes of the Company, in the same manner as corporate shareholders under the Code and the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
    
  ARTICLE VII 
  MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF BUSINESS 
    
  Section 7.1              Board of Directors. 
    
  (a)           Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors (the    Board of Directors   ).  As provided in Section 7.3, the Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to appoint Officers of the Company.  The Directors shall constitute  managers  within the meaning of the Delaware LLC Act.

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement and to the extent permitted by law, as near as practical, the authority, powers, functions and duties (including fiduciary duties) of the Board of Directors shall be identical to the authority, powers, functions and duties (including fiduciary duties) of the board of directors of a business corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law.  In addition to the powers that now or hereafter can be granted to managers under the Delaware LLC Act and to all other powers granted under any other provision of this Agreement subject to Section 7.3, the Board of Directors, without Shareholder approval, shall have full power and authority to do, and to direct the Officers to do, all things (and on such terms as it determines to be necessary or appropriate) to conduct the business of the Company, to exercise all powers set forth in Section 2.4 and to effectuate the purposes set forth in Section 2.4, including the following: 
    
  (i)         the making of any expenditures, the lending or borrowing of money, the assumption or guarantee of, or other contracting for, indebtedness and other liabilities, the issuance of evidences of indebtedness, including indebtedness that is convertible into or exchangeable for Shares, and the incurring of any other obligations;

(iii)       the acquisition, disposition, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or exchange of any or all of the assets of the Company or the transactions contemplated by Section 14.3(d); 
    
  (iv)       the use of the assets of the Company (including cash on hand) for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the financing of the conduct of the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; the lending of funds to other Persons; and the repayment of obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; 
    
  (v)        the negotiation, execution and performance of any contracts, conveyances or other instruments (including instruments that limit the liability of the Company under contractual arrangements to all or particular assets of the Company); 
    
  (vi)       the distribution of Company cash or other Company assets; 
    
  (vii)      the selection and dismissal of Officers, employees, agents, outside attorneys, accountants, consultants and contractors and the determination of their compensation and other terms of employment or hiring, the creation and operation of employee benefit plans, employee programs and employee practices; 
    
  (viii)     the maintenance of insurance for the benefit of the Company, the Shareholders and the Indemnitees; 
    
  (ix)       the formation of, or acquisition of an interest in, and the contribution of property and the making of loans to, any limited or general partnerships, joint ventures, corporations, limited liability companies or other relationships; 
    
  (x)        the control of any matters affecting the rights and obligations of the Company, including the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation, arbitration or remediation, and the incurring of legal expense and the settlement of claims and litigation; 
    
  (xi)       the indemnification of any Person including, without limitation, as set forth in Article X to the extent permitted by law; 
    
  (xii)      the entering into of listing agreements with any National Securities Exchange and the delisting of some or all of the Shares from, or requesting that trading be suspended on, any such exchange; 
    
  (xiii)     the purchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of securities of the Company, or the issuance of unsecured and secured debt obligations, debt obligations convertible into any class or series of Shares, or any combination of the foregoing, or options, rights, warrants, appreciation rights and other derivative rights relating thereto; and 
    
  (xiv)     the entering into of agreements with any of its Affiliates. 
    
  (b)        The Board of Directors may from time to time determine the number of Directors then constituting the whole Board of Directors,   provided tha  t, effective immediately after the Distribution, such number shall be at least three and no more than seven.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors, by unanimous vote of the Directors then in office, may change the minimum and maximum number of Directors; provided that the Board of Directors shall not decrease the number of Persons that constitutes the whole Board of Directors if such decrease would shorten the term of any Director. 

(c)        Except as may be provided by the Board of Directors in setting the terms of any class or series of Shares, any and all vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors in office, even if the remaining Directors do not constitute a quorum, and any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which such vacancy occurred. 
    
  (d)        Effective upon the Distribution, the Directors (other than any Director subsequently elected solely by holders of one or more classes or series of Shares as specified by the Board of Directors upon the authorization of such Shares) shall be classified into three groups, Group I, Group II and Group III.  The number of Directors in each class shall be as nearly equal in number as possible, as determined by the Board of Directors.  Directors in Group I shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2008; Directors in Group II shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2009; and Directors in Group III shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2010 and, in each such case, until their successors are duly elected or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.  At each annual meeting of the Shareholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose term expires at such meeting shall be elected by the Shareholders to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of Shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors are duly elected. 
    
  (e)        Effective upon the Distribution, three of the Directors shall be  Independent Directors,  as defined below, and the remaining two Directors shall be  Managing Directors.   Independent Directors  shall be those directors who meet the qualifications as independent directors under the applicable rules of each National Securities Exchange on which the Common Shares or other securities of the Company are listed for trading and the Commission from time to time.   Managing Directors  shall mean Directors who are not Independent Directors.  If at any time the Board of Directors shall not be comprised of a majority of Independent Directors, the Board of Directors shall take such actions as will cure such condition, including increasing the size of the Board of Directors and electing one or more Independent Directors; provided that the fact that the Board of Directors does not have a majority of Independent Directors at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Directors. 
    
  (f)        Effective upon the Distribution, the Group I Directors, the Group II Directors and the Group III Directors shall be as specified in a written consent of the Initial Shareholder adopted prior to the Distribution. 
    
  (g)        Directors need not be Shareholders.  The Board of Directors may, from time to time and by the adoption of resolutions, establish qualifications for Directors. 
    
  (h)        Unless otherwise required by law or the provisions hereof, 
    
  (i)         each member of the Board of Directors shall have one vote; 
    
  (ii)        the presence at a meeting of the Board of Directors of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum at any such meeting (or at any adjournment thereof) for the transaction of business; and 
    
  (iii)       the act of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present shall be deemed to constitute the act of the Board of Directors. 
    
  (i)         Regular meetings of the Board of Directors and any committee thereof shall be held at such times and places as shall be designated from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors or such committee.  Notice of such regular meetings shall not be required.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors or meetings of any committee thereof may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the chairman of such committee, as the case may be, or on the written request of a majority of the Directors then in office or a majority of the committee members then in office, as applicable, to the Secretary, in each case on at least twenty-four hours personal, written, fax or other electronic notice to each Director  

or committee member, which notice may be waived by any Director.  Any such notice, or waiver thereof, need not state the purpose of such meeting except as may otherwise be required by law.  Attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such Director attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or committee.  Members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in and hold a meeting by means of conference telephone, video conference or similar communications equipment by means of which all Persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time, and participation in such meetings shall constitute presence in Person at the meeting. 
    
  (j)         The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors.  The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified Director at any meeting of such committee.  Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in this Agreement, shall have and may exercise all powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: approving or adopting, or recommending to the Shareholders, any action or matter expressly required by this Agreement or the Delaware LLC Act to be submitted to the Shareholders for approval, or adopting, amending or repealing any provision of this Agreement.  The Board of Directors, or, if authorized by the Board in a committee charter or otherwise, the members of any committee may choose a chairman, shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when requested, and, unless the same shall be determined by the Board of Directors, shall fix its own rules or procedures and shall meet at such times and at such place or places as may be provided by such rules.  Unless otherwise required by law or the provisions hereof, 
    
  (i)         each member of a committee shall have one vote; 
    
  (ii)        the presence at a meeting of a committee of a majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum at any such meeting for the transaction of business; and 
    
  (iii)       the act of a majority of the members of a committee present at a meeting of the committee at which a quorum is present shall be deemed to constitute the act of the committee. 
    
  (k)        The Board of Directors may elect one of its members as Chairman of the Board (the    Chairman of the Board   ).  The Chairman of the Board, if any, and if present and acting, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of Shareholders, unless otherwise directed by the Board of Directors.  If the Board of Directors does not elect a Chairman or if the Chairman is absent from the meeting, the Chief Executive Offer, if present and a Director, or any other Director chosen by the Board of Directors, shall preside.  In the absence of a Secretary, the person presiding over the meeting may appoint any Person to serve as secretary of the meeting. 
    
  (l)         Unless otherwise restricted by law, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of the Directors.  The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or paid a stated salary or paid other compensation as Director.  No such payment shall preclude any Director from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.  Directors serving on special or standing committees may also be paid their expenses, if any, of and allowed compensation for attending committee meetings. 
    
  (m)      Subject to the rights of holders of one or more future classes or series of Shares to elect or remove one or more Directors, any Director may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and then only by the unanimous vote of the other Directors then in office.  In addition, subject to the rights of holders of one or more future classes or series of Shares to elect or remove one or more Directors, the entire Board of Directors (but not less than the entire Board  

of Directors) may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and then only by Share Super-Majority Approval.  For the purpose of this paragraph,  cause  shall mean, with respect to any particular Director, incapacity, conviction of a felony or a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holding that such Director caused demonstrable, material harm to the Company through bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty.

The Board of Directors shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or documents that it determines to be necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited liability company in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the Company may elect to do business or own property.  To the extent that the Board of Directors determines such action to be necessary or appropriate, the Board of Directors shall direct the appropriate Officers of the Company to file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Formation and do all things to maintain the Company as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Company may elect to do business or own property.  The Company shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Formation, any qualification document or any amendment thereto to any Shareholder. 
    
  Section 7.3              Officers. 
    
  (a)        The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to appoint such officers with such titles, authority and duties as determined by the Board of Directors.  Such Persons so designated by the Board of Directors shall be referred to as    Officers  .  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement and to the extent permitted by law, as near as practical, the authority, powers, functions and duties (including fiduciary duties) of the Officers shall be identical to the authority, powers, functions and duties (including fiduciary duties) of the officers of a business corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

  (c)        Any Officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the Company.  Any Officer, agent or employee of the Company may be removed by the Board of Directors with or without cause at any time.  The Board of Directors may delegate the power of removal as to officers, agents and employees who have not been appointed by the Board of Directors.  Such removal shall be without prejudice to a Person s contract rights, if any, but the appointment of any Person as an Officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not of itself create contract rights. 
    
  (d)        Subject to the control of the Board of Directors and the executive committee (if any) of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer shall have general executive charge, management and control of the properties, business and operations of the Company with all such powers as may be reasonably incident to such responsibilities; he or she may employ and discharge employees and agents of the Company except such as shall be appointed by the Board of Directors, and he or she may delegate these powers; he or she may agree upon and execute all leases, contracts, evidences of indebtedness and other obligations in the name of the Company, and shall have such other powers and duties as designated in accordance with this Agreement and as from time to time may be assigned by the Board of Directors.

In the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of a Vice President to perform the duties of the President, or in the event of his absence or inability or refusal to act, the Vice President who is present and who is senior in terms of uninterrupted time as a Vice President of the Company shall so act.  The Vice President shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the President or the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. 
    
  (h)        The Treasurer shall have responsibility for the custody and control of all the funds and securities of the Company and shall have such other powers and duties as are designated in accordance with this Agreement and as from time to time may be assigned to the Treasurer by the Board of Directors.

  (a)        Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or required by the Delaware LLC Act, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between any Shareholder or an Affiliate thereof, and/or one or more Directors or their respective Affiliates and/or the Company, any resolution or course of action by the Board of Directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Shareholders, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, including any fiduciary duty, if the resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by a Share Plurality (with interested Shareholders not counted for any purpose), or (ii) on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair and reasonable to the Company, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Company).

  (b)        Each Director shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and on such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Company by any of the Company s Officers or employees, or committees of the Board of Directors, or by any other Person as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within such other Person s professional or expert competence.

Each Shareholder hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the Board of Directors or any Officer in connection with any such dealing.

  Section 8.2              Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of Shares. 
    
  (a)          Ownership Limitations  .  Commencing on the Distribution Date: 
    
  (i)            Basic Restrictions.    (A) No Person, other than an Excepted Holder or an Excluded Holder, shall Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit, (B) no Excepted Holder shall Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder, and (C) no Excluded Holder shall Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Excluded Holder Limit for such Excluded Holder. 
    
  (ii)          Transfer in Trust.    If any Transfer of Shares occurs (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of a National Securities Exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) which, if effective, would result in any Person Constructively Owning Shares in violation of Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or 8.2(a)(i)(C), as applicable; (x) then that number of Shares the Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or 8.2(a)(i)(C) (rounded upward to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Charitable Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 8.3, effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer (or as of the close of business on the Distribution Date as to any  

such Transfer that occurs on the Distribution Date), and such Person shall acquire no rights in such Shares; or (y) if the transfer to the Charitable Trust described in clause (x) of this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or   8.2(a)(i)(C)  , as applicable, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Transfer of that number of Shares that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 8.2(a)(i)(A), 8.2(a)(i)(B) or   8.2(a)(i)(C)  , as applicable, shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. 
    
  (b)          Remedies for Breach  .  If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall at any time determine that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section 8.2(a)(i) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Constructive Ownership of any Shares in violation of Section 8.2(a)(i) (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem Shares, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event (and such Person shall be liable, without limitation, for all costs incurred in connection therewith and pursuant to Section 10.3);   provided, however  , that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 8.2(a)(i) shall automatically result in the transfer to the Charitable Trust described above, and, where applicable under Section 8.2(a)(ii)(y) such Transfer (or other event) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. 
    
  (c)          Notice of Restricted Transfer.    Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Constructive Ownership of Shares that will or may violate Section 8.2(a)(i), or any Person who would have owned Shares that resulted in a transfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2(a)(ii)(x), shall immediately give written notice to the Company of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice, and shall provide to the Company such other information as the Company may request. 
    
  (d)          Owners Required to Provide Information.    Commencing on the Distribution Date, every Shareholder of record of more than five percent of the Outstanding Shares of any series or class, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year and also within 30 days after a request from the Company, shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of Shares owned, and a description of the manner in which such Shares are held;   provided that   a Shareholder of record who holds Outstanding Shares as nominee for another Person, which other Person is required to include in gross income the distributions received on such Shares (an    Actual Owner   ), shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such Actual Owner and the number of Shares of such Actual Owner with respect to which the Shareholder of record is nominee.  Each such Shareholder of record and each Actual Owner shall provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to ensure compliance with the Ownership Limit. 
    
  (e)          Ambiguity.    In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 or any definition contained in Section 8.1, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 with respect to any situation based upon the facts known to it.  If Section 8.2 or 8.3 requires an action by the Board of Directors and this Agreement does not contain a specific provision authorizing such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 8.1, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3. 
    
  (f)          Exceptions  . 
    
  (i)    The Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), may grant to any Person who makes a request therefor (a    Requesting Person   ) an exception to the Ownership Limit (or one or more elements thereof) with respect to the ownership of any series or class of Shares, subject to the following conditions and  

limitations: (A) (1) the Board of Directors shall have determined, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), that the Requesting Person s ownership of Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit pursuant to the exception requested hereunder (together with the ownership of Shares by all other Persons as permitted under this Article VIII, taking into account any previously granted exceptions pursuant hereto) would not cause a default under the terms of any contract to which the Company is a party or reasonably expects to become a party and (2) the Board of Directors shall have determined, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), and in the case of each individual Director, in his business judgment, that the Requesting Person s ownership of Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit pursuant to the exception requested hereunder (together with the ownership of Shares by all other Persons as permitted under this Article VIII, taking into account any previously granted exceptions pursuant hereto) is in the best interests of the Company; and (B) such Requesting Person provides to the Board of Directors, for the benefit of the Company, such representations and undertakings, if any, as the Board of Directors may, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), determine to be necessary in order for it to make the determination that the conditions set forth in clause (A) above of this Section 8.2(f)(i) have been and/or will continue to be satisfied (including, without limitation, an agreement as to a reduced Ownership Limit or Excepted Holder Limit for such Requesting Person with respect to the Constructive Ownership of one or more other classes or series of Shares not subject to the exception), and such Requesting Person agrees that any violation of such representations and undertakings or any attempted violation thereof will result in the application of the remedies set forth in Section 8.2(b) with respect to Shares held in excess of the Ownership Limit or the Excepted Holder Limit (as may be applicable) with respect to such Requesting Person (determined without regard to the exception granted such Requesting Person under this subparagraph (i)).  If a member of the Board of Directors requests that the Board of Directors grant an exception pursuant to this subsection (f) with respect to such member, or with respect to any other Person if such member of the Board of Directors would be considered to be the Constructive Owner of Shares owned by such other Person, such member of the Board of Directors shall not participate in the decision of the Board of Directors as to whether to grant any such exception. 
    
  (ii)   In determining whether to grant any exemption pursuant to Section 8.2(f)(i), the Board of Directors may, but need not, consider, among other factors, (A) the general reputation and moral character of the Requesting Person, (B) whether ownership of Shares would be direct or through ownership attribution, (C) whether the Requesting Person s ownership of Shares would interfere with the conduct of the Company s business, (D) whether granting an exemption for the Requesting Person would adversely affect any of the Company s existing contractual arrangements, and (E) whether the Requesting Person to whom the exemption would apply is attempting to change control of the Company or affect its policies in a way which the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty), considers adverse to the best interest of the Company or the Shareholders.  Nothing in this Section 8.2(f)(ii) shall be interpreted to mean that the Board of Directors may not act in its sole and absolute discretion (without the application to the fullest extent permitted by law of any fiduciary duty) in making any determination under Section 8.2(f)(i). 
    
  (iii)  An underwriter or initial purchaser that participates in a public offering or a private placement of Shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) may Constructively Own Shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) in excess of the Ownership Limit, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public offering or private placement as determined by the Board of Directors. 

(iv)  The Board of Directors may reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder only: (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. 
    
  (v)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, any determination made by the Board of Directors with respect to the provisions of Section 8.2(f) may be made without regard to any fiduciary or other duties that the Board of Directors may have to the Prohibited Owner or any other Person. 
    
  (g)          Increase or Decrease in Ownership Limit.    The Board of Directors may from time to time increase or decrease the Ownership Limit, provided that any decrease may be made only prospectively as to subsequent holders (other than a decrease as a result of a retroactive change in existing law, in which case such change shall be effective immediately). 
    
  (h)          Legend  .  Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, each certificate for Shares (or securities exercisable for or convertible into Shares) shall bear a legend with respect to the restrictions contained in this Agreement in such form as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors.  Instead of the foregoing legend, the certificate may state that the Company will furnish a full statement about certain restrictions on transferability to a Shareholder on request and without charge. 
    
  (i)           No Recourse  .  A Prohibited Owner shall have no claim, cause of action or other recourse whatsoever against the purported transferor of Shares causing the violation of the restrictions set forth in Section 8.2(a). 
    
  Section 8.3              Transfer of Shares. 
    
  (a)          Ownership in Trust.    Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 8.2(a)(ii) that would result in a transfer of Shares to a Charitable Trust, such Shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee as trustee of a Charitable Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3(e)).  Such transfer to the Charitable Trustee shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to any other purported Transfer or other event that otherwise results in the transfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii) (or as of the close of business on the Distribution Date if such other purported Transfer or other event occurs on that date).  The Charitable Trustee shall be appointed by the Company and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the Company and any Prohibited Owner.  Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the Company as provided in Section 8.3(g). 
    
  (b)          Status of Shares Held by the Charitable Trustee.    Shares held by the Charitable Trustee shall be issued and Outstanding Shares of the Company.  The Prohibited Owner shall (i) have no rights in the Shares held by the Charitable Trustee; (ii) not benefit economically from ownership of any Shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3(e)); (iii) have no rights to dividends or other distributions; (iv) not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the Shares held in the Charitable Trust; and (v) have no claim, cause of action or other recourse whatsoever against the purported transferor of such Shares. 
    
  (c)          Dividend and Voting Rights  .  The Charitable Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect to Shares held in the Charitable Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3(e)).  Any dividend or other distribution paid prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee shall be paid with respect to such Shares to the Charitable Trustee by the Prohibited Owner upon demand and any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Charitable Trustee.  Any dividends or distributions so paid over to the Charitable Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable Beneficiary.  The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to Shares held in the Charitable Trust and, effective as of the date that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, the Charitable Trustee shall have the authority (at the Charitable Trustee s sole  

discretion) (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee and (ii) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Charitable Trustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; provided, however, that if the Company has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Charitable Trustee shall not have the power to rescind and recast such vote.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, until the Company has received notification that Shares have been transferred into a Charitable Trust, the Company shall be entitled to rely on its stock transfer and other Shareholder records for purposes of preparing lists of Shareholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and authority of proxies, and otherwise conducting votes of Shareholders. 
    
  (d)          Rights upon Liquidation.    Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets of the Company, the Charitable Trustee shall be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of Shares of the class or series of Shares that is held in the Charitable Trust, that portion of the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of such class or series (determined based upon the ratio that the number of Shares of such class or series of Shares held by the Charitable Trustee bears to the total number of Shares of such class or series of Shares then outstanding).  The Charitable Trustee shall distribute any such assets received in respect of the Shares held in the Charitable Trust in any liquidation, dissolution or winding up or distribution of the assets of the Company, in accordance with Section 8.3(e). 
    
  (e)          Sale of Shares by Charitable Trustee  . 
    
  (i)    Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, the Charitable Trustee shall sell the Shares held in the Charitable Trust (together with the right to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to such Shares as to any Shares transferred to the Charitable Trustee as a result of the operation of Section 8.2(a)(ii)) to a Person, designated by the Charitable Trustee, whose ownership of the Shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i).  Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate and the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section 8.3(e). 
    
  (ii)   A Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (1) the net price paid by the Prohibited Owner for the Shares or, if the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the Shares in connection with the event causing the Shares to be held in the Charitable Trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the Market Price of the Shares on the day of the event causing the Shares to be held in the Charitable Trust, and (2) the net sales proceeds received by the Charitable Trustee from the sale or other disposition of the Shares held in the Charitable Trust.  Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.  If, prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, such Shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (i) such Shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Charitable Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such Shares that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 8.3(e), such excess shall be paid to the Charitable Trustee upon demand. 
    
  (f)           Purchase Right in Shares Transferred to Trustee.    Shares transferred to the Charitable Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Company, or its designee, at a price per Share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per Share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Charitable Trust (or, in the case of a devise, gift or other such transaction, the Market Price per such Share on the day of the event causing the Shares to be held in the Charitable Trust) and (ii) the Market Price per such Share on the date the Company, or its designee, accepts such offer.  The Company shall have the right to accept such offer until the Charitable Trustee has sold the Shares held in the Charitable Trust pursuant to Section 8.3(e).  Upon such a sale to the Company, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate and the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in Section 8.3(e). 

(g)          Designation of Charitable Beneficiaries.    By written notice to the Charitable Trustee, the Company shall designate from time to time one or more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest in the Charitable Trust such that (i) Shares held in the Charitable Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i) in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary and (ii) contributions to each such organization must be eligible for deduction under each of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code. 
    
  Section 8.4               Transactions on a National Securities Exchange.    Nothing in this Article VIII shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of a National Securities Exchange or any automated inter-dealer quotation system.  The fact that the settlement of any transaction takes place shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this Article VIII and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article VIII. 
    
  Section 8.5               Enforcement.    The Company is authorized specifically to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this Article VIII (and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a Person shall be liable, without limitation, for all costs incurred in connection therewith and pursuant to Section 10.3). 
    
  Section 8.6               Non-Waiver.    No delay or failure on the part of the Company or the Board of Directors in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Company or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, except to the extent specifically waived in writing. 
    
  Section 8.7              Enforceability.    If any of the restrictions on transfer of Shares contained in this Article VIII are determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Prohibited Owner may be deemed, at the option of the Company, to have acted as an agent of the Company in acquiring such Shares and to hold such Shares on behalf of the Company. 
    
  ARTICLE IX 
  VOTING RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS; MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
    
  Section 9.1               General. 
    
  (a)        The provisions of this Article IX shall be subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act and any applicable Exchange Rule.  If, in the Opinion of Counsel, any of such provisions are inconsistent with such requirements, such requirements shall supersede the provisions of this Agreement and the Board of Directors shall amend the provisions of this Article IX so as to make its provisions consistent with such requirements. 
    
  (b)        Any matter, including the nomination of Directors, submitted by the Board of Directors to the Shareholders for approval, and any matter otherwise voted upon by the Shareholders and subject to the provisions of Section 5.5 (relating to the creation of new classes and series of Shares) and Section 7.1(m) (relating to the removal of Directors by the Shareholders), shall require the following vote by the Shareholders for approval: (i) the election of Directors nominated by the Board of Directors, a Share Majority; (ii) any other matter that has been approved previously by the Board of Directors, a Share Plurality; and (iii) any matter that has not been approved previously by the Board of Directors, a Share Super-Majority Approval.  There shall not be cumulative voting of Common Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1(b), the election of a Managing Director or an Independent Director in an uncontested election (which, for purposes of this Agreement, is an election in which the number of nominees for election equals or is less than the number to be elected at a meeting) shall require the vote of a plurality of the Outstanding Shares with voting power voting at a meeting of Shareholders.  
    
  (c)        All meetings of Shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the Company or at such other place as shall be set by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.  For purposes of determining the Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Shareholders, the Board of Directors may set a Record  

Date.  If no Record Date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the Record Date for determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given.  A determination of Shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall apply to any adjournment or postponement of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new Record Date for the adjourned or postponed meeting. 
    
  (d)        An annual meeting of the Shareholders shall be called by the Board of Directors and shall be held on a date and at the time set by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors shall cause at least 30 days  notice to be given of an annual meeting of Shareholders. 
    
  (e)        The Chairman of the Board, if any, or a majority of the entire Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the Shareholders.  Subject to subsection (f) and the last sentence of this subsection (e), a special meeting of Shareholders shall also be called by the Secretary of the Company upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting.  The    Special Meeting Percentage    shall be a majority or, to the extent permitted by any applicable Exchange Rule, such higher percentage as shall be specified from time to time by the Board of Directors;   provided, however  , that in no case shall the Special Meeting Percentage be more than 75%.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to permit the Shareholders to cause a special meeting of the Shareholders to be called unless applicable law or Exchange Rule requires that the Shareholders be able to do so. 
    
  (f)         Subject to the last sentence of subsection (e), any Shareholder of record seeking to have Shareholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary (the    Record Date Request Notice   ) by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date to determine the Shareholders entitled to request a special meeting (the    Request Record Date   ).  No Shareholder may make a Record Date Request Notice unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s written request to the Secretary, as described in the preceding sentence, in order for such request to be effective;   provided, however  , that the provisions of this sentence shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them.  The Record Date Request Notice shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, shall be signed by one or more Shareholders of record as of the date of signature (or their duly authorized agents), shall bear the date of signature of each such Shareholder (or other agent) and shall set forth all information relating to each such Shareholder that must be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act.  Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors may fix a Request Record Date and may also fix the Special Meeting Percentage for that meeting.  The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  If the Board of Directors, within ten days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the Request Record Date and make a public announcement of such Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business on the tenth day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the Secretary. 
    
  (g)        Subject to the last sentence of subsection (e), in order for any Shareholder to request a special meeting, one or more written requests for a special meeting (the    Special Meeting Request   ) signed by Shareholders of record (or their duly authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall be delivered to the Secretary.  No Shareholder may make a Special Meeting Request unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s written request to the Secretary, as described in the preceding sentence, in order for such request to be effective;   provided, however  , that the provisions of this sentence shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them.  In addition, the Special Meeting Request shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it (which shall be limited to the matters set forth in the Record Date Request Notice received by the Secretary), shall bear the date of signature of each such Shareholder (or other agent) signing the  

Special Meeting Request, shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Company s books, of each Shareholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed) and the class and number of Shares of the Company which are owned of record and beneficially by each such Shareholder, shall be sent to the Secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested, and must be received by the Secretary within 60 days after the Request Record Date.  Any requesting Shareholder may revoke his request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary. 
    
  (h)        The Secretary shall inform the requesting Shareholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of meeting (including the Company s proxy materials).  The Secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon Shareholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the written requests required by subsection (g), the Secretary receives payment from the requesting Shareholders of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the mailing of any notice of the meeting. 
    
  (i)         Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Officer who called the meeting, if any, and otherwise by the Board of Directors.  In the case of any special meeting called by the Secretary upon the request of Shareholders (a    Shareholder Requested Meeting   ), such meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors;   provided, however  , that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received by the Secretary (the    Delivery Date   ), a date and time for a Shareholder Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m., local time on the 90(th) day after the record date for such Shareholder Requested Meeting (the    Meeting Record Date   ) or, if such 90(th) day is not a Business Day, on the first preceding Business Day; and   provided further   that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Shareholder Requested Meeting within ten days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive offices of the Company.  In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.  In the case of any Shareholder Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30(th) day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date. 
    
  (j)         If at any time as a result of written revocations of requests for the special meeting, Shareholders of record (or their duly authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall have delivered and not revoked requests for a special meeting, the Secretary may refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting or, if the notice of the meeting has been mailed, the Secretary may revoke the notice of the meeting at any time not less than ten days before the meeting if the Secretary has first sent to all other requesting Shareholders written notice of such revocation and of intention to revoke the notice of the meeting.  Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of a notice of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special meeting. 
    
  (k)        The Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors may appoint regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the Company for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any Special Meeting Request received by the Secretary.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such request shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Secretary until the earlier of (i) five Business Days after receipt by the Secretary of such request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the Secretary has validly received requests signed by Record Holders (or their duly authorized agents) entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting to be called pursuant to such requests.  Nothing contained in this subsection (k) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Company or any Shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). 

Section 9.2               Notice.    If and to the extent required by law, the Secretary shall give to each Shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting and to each Shareholder not entitled to vote who is entitled to notice of the meeting written notice stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the purpose for which the meeting is called, either by mail, by recognized national courier service, by presenting it to such Shareholder personally, by leaving it at the Shareholder s residence or usual place of business or by any other means, including electronic delivery, permitted by the Delaware LLC Act, the Exchange Act and any applicable Exchange Rule.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the Shareholder at the Shareholder s address as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid.  No business shall be transacted at a Shareholder Requested Meeting except as specifically designated in the notice. 
    
  Section 9.3               Quorum; Organization and Conduct. 
    
  (a)         Quorum.    A quorum for action at an annual or special meeting of Shareholders shall be the holders, present in person or by proxy, of a majority of the Outstanding Shares entitled to vote at the meeting;   provided, however  , that a quorum for the approval of any proposal that requires a Share Separate Class Approval or a Share Super-Majority Approval shall be the holders of that number of each class and series of Shares required to approve the proposal in question. 
    
  (b)          Organization and Conduct  .  Every meeting of Shareholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment, by the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or, in the case of the absence of the Chairman of the Board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting: the Vice Chairman of the Board, if there be one, the President, the Vice Presidents in their order of rank and seniority, or, in the absence of such officers, a chairman chosen by the Shareholders by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by Shareholders present in person or by proxy.  The Secretary, or, in the Secretary s absence, an Assistant Secretary, or in the absence of both the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries, a person appointed by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such appointment, a person appointed by the chairman of the meeting shall act as Secretary.  In the event that the Secretary presides at a meeting of the Shareholders, an Assistant Secretary shall record the minutes of the meeting.  The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of Shareholders shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting.  The chairman of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to Shareholders of record of the Company, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to Shareholders of record of the Company entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (f) removing any Shareholder who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairman of the meeting; and (g) recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and place announced at the meeting.  Unless otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, meetings of Shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure or any established rules of order.  If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Shareholders, the chairman of the meeting or the Shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall have the authority to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a specified date without notice other than announcement at the meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  The Shareholders present either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has been duly called and convened, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Shareholders to leave less than a quorum. 
    
  Section 9.4               Proxies.    A Shareholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by the Shares owned of record by the Shareholder in person or by proxy granted by the Shareholder or by the Shareholder s duly authorized agent in  

writing, by any means permitted by the Board of Directors or in any manner required by law.  Such proxy or evidence of authorization of such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Company before or at the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months after its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy. 
    
  Section 9.5               Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. 
    
  (a)        For all purposes of this Agreement, Shares registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock.  For all purposes of this Agreement, any director or other fiduciary may vote stock registered in his name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.  Shares directly or indirectly owned by the Company shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of Outstanding Shares entitled to be voted at any given time, unless they are held by it in a fiduciary capacity, in which case they may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of Outstanding Shares at any given time. 
    
  (b)        The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure by which a Shareholder may certify in writing to the Company that any Shares registered in the name of the Shareholder are held for the account of a specified person other than the Shareholder.  The resolution shall set forth the class of Shareholders who may make the certification, the purpose for which the certification may be made, the form of certification and the information to be contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a record date or closing of the stock transfer books, the time after the record date or closing of the stock transfer books within which the certification must be received by the Company; and any other provisions with respect to the procedure which the Board of Directors considers necessary or desirable.  On receipt of such certification, the person specified in the certification shall be regarded as, for the purposes set forth in the certification, the Shareholder of record of the specified stock in place of the Shareholder who makes the certification. 
    
  Section 9.6               Inspectors.    The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more individual inspectors or one or more entities that designate individuals as inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If an inspector or inspectors are not appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors.  In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting.  The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of Shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all Shareholders.  Each such report shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of Shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be   prima facie   evidence thereof. 
    
  Section 9.7               Advance Notice of Shareholder Nominees for Director and Other Shareholder Proposals. 
    
  (a)        Annual Meetings of Shareholders.  (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the Shareholders may be made at an annual meeting of Shareholders (i) pursuant to the Company s notice of meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any Shareholder of the Company (A) who holds, at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 9.7 and through and including the time of the annual meeting, a Certificate evidencing such Shareholder s ownership of all Shares owned by such Shareholder, (B) who is entitled to vote at the meeting and present in person or by proxy at the meeting to answer questions concerning the nomination or business, and (C) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.7. 

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a Shareholder pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.7(a)(1), the Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for Shareholder action.  To be timely, a Shareholder s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day nor earlier than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the preceding year s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than thirty (30) days earlier or later than the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year s annual meeting, notice by the Shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth (10th) day following the earlier of the day on which (A) notice of the date of the annual meeting is mailed or otherwise made available or (B) public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by the Company.  In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement of the mailing of notice for such annual meeting or of an adjournment of an annual meeting to a later date or time commence a new time period for the giving of Shareholder s notice as described above.  No Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary described in this Section 9.7(a)(2) unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s notice to the Secretary in order for such notice to be effective;   provided, however  , that (x) the provisions of this sentence and clause (A) of Section 9.7(a)(1)(ii) shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them, and (y) if clause (x) of this proviso is applicable, no Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary described in this Section 9.7(a)(2) unless such Shareholder is, at the time of giving such notice and through and including the time of the annual meeting, a Shareholder of record of all Shares owned by such Shareholder.  Such Shareholder s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the Shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, (i) such person s name, age, business address and residence address, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person for the past five years, (iii) the class and number of Shares of the Company that are beneficially owned or owned of record by such person and the investment intent of such acquisition, (iv) the record of all purchases and sales of securities of the Company by such person during the previous 12 month period including the dates of the transactions, the class, series and number of securities involved in the transactions and the consideration involved, and (v) all other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act, including such person s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the Shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any interest in such business of such Shareholder (including any anticipated benefit to the Shareholder therefrom) and of each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the Shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person, (i) the class, series and number of securities of the Company which are owned of record by such Shareholder and by such Shareholder Associated Person, if any; (ii) the class, series and number of, and the nominee holder for, Shares owned beneficially but not of record by such Shareholder and by any Shareholder Associated Person, if any; (iii) the name and address of such Shareholder as it appears on the Company s stock ledger and the address, if different, of such Shareholder Associated Person; (iv) the record of all purchases and sales of securities of the Company by such Shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person during the previous 12 month period including the dates of the transactions, the class, series and number of securities involved in the transactions and the consideration involved; and (v) to the extent known by such Shareholder, the name and address of any other Shareholder supporting the nominee for election or reelection as a director or the proposal of other business on the date of such Shareholder s notice. 
    
  For the purposes of this Section 9.7,  Shareholder Associated Person  of any Shareholder shall mean (i) any Person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such Shareholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of Common Shares or other securities issued by the Company owned of record or beneficially by such Shareholder and (iii) any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person. 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 9.7(a)(2) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of notice for the preceding year s annual meeting, a Shareholder s notice required by this Section 9.7 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company. 
    
  (b)          Shareholder Proposals Causing Covenant Breaches.    At the same time as or prior to the submission of any Shareholder proposal of business to be conducted at an annual or special meeting that, if approved and implemented by the Company, would cause the Company to be in breach of any covenant of the Company in any existing or proposed debt instrument of the Company or agreement of the Company with any lender, the proponent Shareholder or Shareholders must submit to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company (i) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the lender s willingness to waive the breach of covenant or (ii) a plan for repayment of the indebtedness to the lender and the payment of all related interest, prepayment premiums, breakage costs and other amounts due and payable in connection with such repayment satisfactory to the Board of Directors, specifically identifying the source of funds to be used in the repayment and related payments and presenting evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors that the identified funds could be applied by the Company to the repayment. 
    
  (c)          Shareholder Proposals Requiring Regulatory Notice, Consent or Approval.    At the same time or prior to the submission of any Shareholder proposal of business to be conducted at an annual or special meeting that, if approved, could not be implemented by the Company without notifying or obtaining the consent or approval of any federal, state, municipal or other regulatory body, the proponent Shareholder or Shareholders must submit to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company (i) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors that any and all required notices, consents or approvals have been given or obtained or (ii) a plan, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, for making the requisite notices or obtaining the requisite consents or approvals, as applicable, prior to the implementation of the proposal. 
    
  (d)          Special Meetings of Shareholders  .  Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of Shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company s notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may only be made at a special meeting of Shareholders at which directors are to be elected: (i) pursuant to the Company s notice of meeting for a meeting called by the Chairman or the Board of Directors by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such special meeting, by any Shareholder of the Company (A) who holds, at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 9.7(d) and through and including the time of the special meeting, a Certificate evidencing such Shareholder s ownership of all Shares owned by such Shareholder, (B) who is entitled to vote at the meeting and present in person or by proxy at the meeting to answer questions concerning the nomination or business and (C) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.7(d).  If, pursuant to the request of the Chairman, the President or a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, the Company calls a special meeting of Shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such Shareholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company s notice of meeting, if the Shareholder s notice contains the information required by Section 9.7(a)(2) and the notice has been delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the later of (x) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or (y) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of a special meeting to a later date or time commence a new time period for the giving of a Shareholder s notice as described above.  No Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary provided for in this Section 9.7(d) unless such Shareholder holds a Certificate for all Shares owned by such Shareholder, and a copy of each Certificate shall accompany such Shareholder s notice to the Secretary in order for such  

notice to be effective; provided, however, that (x) the provisions of this sentence and clause (A) of Section 9.7(d)(ii) shall be inapplicable unless Shareholders are entitled to receive a Certificate evidencing the Shares owned by them, and (y) if clause (x) of this proviso is applicable, no Shareholder may give a notice to the Secretary described in this Section 9.7(d) unless such Shareholder is, at the time of giving such notice and through and including the time of the special meeting, a Shareholder of record of all Shares owned by such Shareholder.   
    
  (e)          General.

  (c)        The indemnification, advancement of expenses and other provisions of this Section 10.1 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter, pursuant to a vote of the Board of Directors, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.

  (g)        An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 10.1 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement or applicable law. 
    
  (h)        The indemnification, advancement of expenses and other provisions of this Section 10.1 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.
