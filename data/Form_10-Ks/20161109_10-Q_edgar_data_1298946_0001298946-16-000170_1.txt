DIAMONDROCK HOSPITALITY COMPANY 
    
  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

1. 
    Organization 
       
  DiamondRock Hospitality Company (the  Company  or  we ) is a lodging-focused real estate company that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts.  Our hotels are concentrated in key gateway cities and in destination resort locations and the majority of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies (Marriott International, Inc. or Hilton Worldwide). We are an owner, as opposed to an operator, of the hotels in our portfolio. As an owner, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after we pay fees to the hotel managers, which are based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   26   hotels with   9,461   guest rooms, located in the following markets: Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts (  2  ); Burlington, Vermont; Charleston, South Carolina; Chicago, Illinois (  2  ); Denver, Colorado (  2  ); Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Fort Worth, Texas; Huntington Beach, California; Key West, Florida (  2  ); New York, New York (  4  ); Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Sonoma, California; Washington D.C. (  2  ); St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; and Vail, Colorado.  
    
  We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, in which our hotel properties are owned by our operating partnership, DiamondRock Hospitality Limited Partnership, or subsidiaries of our operating partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of our operating partnership and currently owns, either directly or indirectly, all of the limited partnership units of our operating partnership. 

2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. However, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on   February 29, 2016  . 
    
  In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full-year performance because of the impact of seasonal and short-term variations. 
    
  Our financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  If the Company determines that it has an interest in a variable interest entity within the meaning of the FASB ASC 810,   Consolidation  , the Company will consolidate the entity when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the entity. 
    
  Certain amounts in the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation. 
    
  Property and Equipment 
    
  Investments in hotel properties, land, land improvements, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Property and equipment purchased after the hotel acquisition date is recorded at cost. Replacements and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or retirement of a fixed asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the Company s accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the statements of operations. 
    
  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally   15   to   40   years for buildings, land improvements, and building improvements and   1   to   10   years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.

Table of Contents  

We review our investments in hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause a review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel, less costs to sell, exceed its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel s estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss is recognized.  
    
  We will classify a hotel as held for sale in the period that we have made the decision to dispose of the hotel, a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing or other contingencies exist which could cause the transaction to not be completed in a timely manner. If these criteria are met, we will record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount of the hotel and related assets and will cease recording depreciation expense. We will classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet.  
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenues from operations of the hotels are recognized when the goods or services are provided. Revenues consist of room sales, food and beverage sales, and other hotel department revenues, such as telephone, parking, gift shop sales and resort fees. 
    
  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus other potentially dilutive securities such as equity awards or shares issuable in the event of conversion of operating partnership units. No adjustment is made for shares that are anti-dilutive during a period. 
    
  Stock-based Compensation 
    
  We account for stock-based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting. We record the cost of stock-based awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The vesting of the awards issued to officers and employees is based on either continued employment (time-based) or based on continued employment and the relative total shareholder returns of the Company or improvement in market share of the Company's hotels (performance-based). The cost of time-based awards and performance-based awards is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, adjusted for forfeitures.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings during the period in which the new rate is enacted. 
    
  We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which requires that we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income annually to our stockholders and comply with certain other requirements. In addition to paying federal and state taxes on any retained income, we may be subject to taxes on  built-in gains  on sales of certain assets. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will generally be subject to federal, state, local, and/or foreign income taxes. 
    
  In order for the income from our hotel property investments to constitute  rents from real properties  for purposes of the gross income tests required for REIT qualification, the income we earn cannot be derived from the operation of any of our hotels. Therefore, we lease each of our hotel properties to a wholly owned subsidiary of Bloodstone TRS, Inc., our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, except for the Frenchman s Reef   Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort, which is owned by a Virgin Islands corporation, which we have elected to be treated as a TRS. 
    
  We had   no   accruals for tax uncertainties as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Fair Value Measurements 
    
  In evaluating fair value, U.S. GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and a reporting entity s own assumptions about market data (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs used to determine fair value, which are then classified and disclosed in one of the three categories. The three levels are as follows:  
    
     Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
     Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical 
  or similar assets in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable 
     Level 3 - Model-derived valuations with unobservable inputs 
    
  Intangible Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Intangible assets and liabilities are recorded on non-market contracts assumed as part of the acquisition of certain hotels. We review the terms of agreements assumed in conjunction with the purchase of a hotel to determine if the terms are favorable or unfavorable compared to an estimated market agreement at the acquisition date. Favorable lease assets or unfavorable contract liabilities are recorded at the acquisition date and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the agreement. We do not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but we review these assets for impairment annually or at interim periods if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued  Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU No. 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies various aspects of how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This standard requires companies to record all of the tax effects related to share-based payments through the income statement, allows companies to elect an accounting policy to either estimate the share based award forfeitures (and expense) or account for forfeitures (and expense) as they occur, and allows companies to withhold up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate the shares upon settlement of an award without causing the award to be classified as liability. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016,  the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which primarily changes the lessee's accounting for operating leases by requiring recognition of lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We adopted ASU No. 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016 and it did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Table of Contents  

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. We adopted ASU No. 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016 and present all debt issuance costs, other than issuance costs related to our senior unsecured credit facility, as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability. Adoption of this standard was applied retrospectively for all periods presented, affecting only the presentation of our balance sheet. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our financial position and had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows.  
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate the consolidation of limited partnerships, variable interests and similar entities. We adopted ASU No. 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016 and concluded that our operating partnership now meets the criteria of a variable interest entity.  The Company is the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, we continue to consolidate our operating partnership. The Company s sole significant asset is its investment in its operating partnership, and consequently, substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of its operating partnership.  In addition, all of the Company's debt is an obligation of its operating partnership.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which affects virtually all aspects of an entity s revenue recognition.  The new standard sets forth five prescribed steps to determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized to appropriately depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which deferred the effectiveness of ASU No. 2014-09 to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and permitted early application for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not believe ASU 2014-09 will have a material impact on the our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

3. 
    Property and Equipment 
       
  Property and equipment as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consists of the following (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had accrued capital expenditures of   $6.7 million   and   $11.6 million  , respectively. 

4.  Favorable Lease Assets 
    
  In connection with the acquisition of certain hotels, we have recognized intangible assets for favorable ground leases and tenant leases. Our favorable lease assets, net of accumulated amortization of   $2.3 million   and   $2.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, consist of the following (in thousands): 

-   8  - 

Table of Contents  

Favorable lease assets are recorded at the acquisition date and are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease agreement.  We recorded   $0.1 million   of amortization expense for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . We recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, of amortization expense for each of the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  On June 30, 2016, we sold the Hilton Minneapolis (see Note 9).  In connection with the sale, we wrote off the favorable ground lease asset, which is included in the gain on sale of hotel properties on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

5.  Capital Stock 
    
  Common Shares 
    
  We are authorized to issue up to   400 million   shares of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends when authorized by our board of directors. 
    
  We have an  at-the-market  equity offering program (the  ATM program ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of up to   $200 million  . We have not sold any shares in 2016 and there is   $128.3 million   remaining under the ATM program. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program  
    
  Our board of directors approved a share repurchase program in November 2015 authorizing us to repurchase up to   $150 million   in shares of our common stock. Repurchases under this program are made in open market or privately negotiated transactions as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. This authority may be exercised from time to time and in such amounts as market conditions warrant, and subject to regulatory considerations. The timing, manner, price and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The share repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.  
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   92,600   shares of our common stock at an average price of   $8.90   per share for a total purchase price of   $0.8 million  . Subsequent to   September 30, 2016   and through November 8, 2016, we repurchased an additional   516,162   shares of our common stock at an average price of   $8.92   per share for a total purchase price of   $4.6 million  . We retired all repurchased shares on their respective settlement dates. As of November 8, 2016, we have   $144.6 million   of authorized capacity remaining under our share repurchase program.  
    
  Dividends 
    
  We have paid the following dividends to holders of our common stock during 2016 as follows: 

Preferred Shares 
    
  We are authorized to issue up to   10 million   shares of preferred stock,   $0.01   par value per share. Our board of directors is required to set for each class or series of preferred stock the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications, and terms or conditions of redemption. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   shares of preferred stock outstanding. 
    
  Operating Partnership Units 

-   9  - 

Table of Contents  

Holders of operating partnership units have certain redemption rights, which would enable them to cause our operating partnership to redeem their units in exchange for cash per unit equal to the market price of our common stock, at the time of redemption, or, at our option for shares of our common stock on a   one  -for-one basis. The number of shares issuable upon exercise of the redemption rights will be adjusted upon the occurrence of stock splits, mergers, consolidations or similar pro-rata share transactions, which otherwise would have the effect of diluting the ownership interests of the limited partners or our stockholders. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   operating partnership units held by unaffiliated third parties. 

6.  Stock Incentive Plans 
    
  On February 17, 2016, our board of directors adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ). The 2016 Plan was approved by our stockholders on May 3, 2016 and replaced the 2004 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2004 Plan"), which was scheduled to expire on April 26, 2017. We no longer make share grants and issuances under the 2004 Plan, although awards previously made under the 2004 Plan that are outstanding will remain in effect in accordance with the terms of that plan and the applicable award agreements. Under the 2016 Plan, we are authorized to issue up to   6,082,664   shares of our common stock. We have issued or committed to issue   53,574   shares under the 2016 Plan as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Restricted Stock Awards 
    
  Restricted stock awards issued to our officers and employees generally vest over a   3  -year period from the date of the grant based on continued employment. We measure compensation expense for the restricted stock awards based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is included in corporate expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. A summary of our restricted stock awards from   January 1, 2016   to   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

The remaining share awards are expected to vest as follows:   245,907   shares during   2017  ,   187,977   shares during   2018  ,   117,379   shares during   2019  , and   11,224   during 2020. As of   September 30, 2016  , the unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was   $4.4 million   and the weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation expense will be recorded is approximately   24   months. We recorded   $0.5 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  We recorded   $2.1 million   of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
    
  The compensation expense recorded for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes the reversal of   $0.2 million   of previously recognized compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of restricted stock awards related to the resignation of our former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  
    
  Performance Stock Units 
    
  Performance stock units ( PSUs ) are restricted stock units that vest   three   years from the date of grant.  Each executive officer is granted a target number of PSUs (the  PSU Target Award ). For the PSUs issued in 2014 and 2015 and vesting in 2017 and 2018, respectively, the actual number of shares of common stock issued to each executive officer is subject to the achievement of certain levels of total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of a peer group of publicly traded lodging REITs over a   three  -year performance period. There will be no payout of shares of our common stock if our total stockholder return falls below the   30  th percentile of the total stockholder returns of the peer group. The maximum number of shares of common stock issued to an executive officer is equal to   150%   of the PSU Target Award and is earned if our total stockholder return is equal to or greater than the   75  th percentile of the total stockholder returns of the peer group. For the PSUs issued in 2016 and vesting in 2019, the calculation of total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of a peer group over a   three  -year performance period remained in effect for   75%   of the number of PSUs to be earned in the performance period. The remaining   25%   is determined based on achieving improvement in market share for each of our hotels over the   three  -year performance period.

We measure compensation expense for the PSUs based upon the fair market value of the award at the grant date.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the   three  -year performance period and is included in corporate expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  The grant date fair value of the portion of the PSUs based on our relative total stockholder return is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation performed by a third-party valuation firm.  The grant date fair value of the portion of the PSUs based on improvement in market share for each of our hotels is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. 
    
  On February 26, 2016, our board of directors granted   310,398   PSUs to our executive officers. The grant date fair value of the portion of the PSUs based on our relative total stockholder return was   $8.42   using the assumptions of volatility of   24.3%   and a risk-free rate of   0.93%  . The grant date fair value of the portion of the PSUs based on hotel market share   $8.91  .  
    
  A summary of our PSUs from   January 1, 2016   to   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

______________________ 
           (1) 
    The number of shares of common stock earned for the PSUs vested in 2016 was equal to   89.5%   of the PSU Target Award.  
       
  The remaining target units are expected to vest as follows:   195,525   units during   2017  ,   204,010   units during   2018   and   277,956   units during   2019  . The number of shares earned upon vesting is subject to the attainment of the performance goals described above. As of   September 30, 2016  , the unrecognized compensation cost related to the PSUs was   $3.3 million   and is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of   23   months.  We recorded   $0.1 million   and   $0.6 million   of compensation expense related to the PSUs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We recorded   $1.4 million   and   $1.7 million   of compensation expense related to the PSUs for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The compensation expense recorded for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes the reversal of   $0.4 million   of previously recognized compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of PSUs related to the resignation of our former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  
    
  Director Stock Grants 
    
  On May 11, 2016, we issued (i)   44,645   shares of common stock and (ii)   8,929   deferred stock units to our board of directors having an aggregate value of   $510,000  , based on the closing stock price for our common stock on such day. The shares of common stock and the deferred stock units issued to our board of directors vest immediately upon issuance.  

7.  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders that has been adjusted for dilutive securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding including dilutive securities. 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except share and per share data): 
  
   -   11  - 

Table of Contents  

We did not include unexercised stock appreciation rights of   20,770   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as they would be anti-dilutive. We did not include the effect of unvested restricted common stock in the calculation of the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as it would be anti-dilutive.  

8.  Debt 
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding the Company s debt as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):

    The loan may be extended for   two   additional   one  -year terms subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including a debt yield based on trailing 12-month hotel cash flows equal to or greater than   13%   at the time the first extension option is exercised, and the payment of an extension fee. As of September 30, 2016, the debt yield was approximately   5.7%  .  
               (4) 
    The credit facility may be extended for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. 
       
  Mortgage Debt 
    
  We have incurred limited recourse, property specific mortgage debt secured by certain of our hotels. In the event of default, the lender may only foreclose on the secured assets; however, in the event of fraud, misapplication of funds or other customary recourse provisions, the lender may seek payment from us.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   nine   of our   26   hotels were secured by mortgage debt.   
    
  Our mortgage debt contains certain property specific covenants and restrictions, including minimum debt service coverage ratios that trigger  cash trap  provisions as well as restrictions on incurring additional debt without lender consent.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the cash trap provision was triggered on the mortgage loan secured by the Lexington Hotel New York. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our mortgage debt. 
    
  On January 11, 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan secured by the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile. The loan had an outstanding principal balance of   $201.7 million   with interest at a fixed rate of   5.98%  .   
    
  On May 11, 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan secured by the Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue.  The loan had an outstanding principal balance of   $48.1 million   with interest at a fixed rate of   6.48%  . 
    
  On June 30, 2016, in connection with the sale of the Hilton Minneapolis, the buyer assumed   $89.5 million   of mortgage debt secured by the hotel. The loan had a fixed interest rate of   5.46%  .  
    
  Senior Unsecured Credit Facility 
    
  We are party to a senior unsecured credit facility. On May 3, 2016, we amended and restated the facility to increase the capacity from   $200 million   to   $300 million  , decrease the pricing and extend the maturity date to May 2020. The maturity date may be extended for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The facility also includes an accordion feature to expand up to   $600 million  , subject to lender consent.  The interest rate on the facility is based upon LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. 
    
  The applicable margin is based upon the Company s leverage ratio, as follows:  

In addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the facility, we were required to pay an amount equal to (x)   0.20%   of the unused portion of the facility if the average usage of the facility was greater than   50%   or (y)   0.30%   of the unused portion of the facility if the average usage of the facility was less than or equal to   50%  .  
    
             The facility also contains various corporate financial covenants. A summary of the most restrictive covenants is as follows: 
  
   -   13  - 

Table of Contents  

_____________________________ 
           (1) 
    Leverage ratio is net indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, divided by total asset value, defined in the credit agreement as the value of our owned hotels based on hotel net operating income divided by a defined capitalization rate.   
              (2) 
    Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA, generally defined in the credit agreement as EBITDA less FF E reserves, for the most recently ending 12 months, to fixed charges, which is defined in the credit agreement as interest expense, all regularly scheduled principal payments and payments on capitalized lease obligations, for the same most recently ending 12-month period. 
              (3) 
    Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit agreement, is (i) total gross book value of all assets, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, less intangible assets, total indebtedness, and all other liabilities, plus (ii)   75%   of net proceeds from future equity issuances. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   borrowings outstanding under the facility and the Company's leverage ratio was   22.1%  . Accordingly, interest on our borrowings under the facility, if any, will be based on LIBOR plus   150   basis points for the following quarter. We incurred interest and unused credit facility fees on the facility of   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We incurred interest and unused credit facility fees on the facility of   $1.1 million   and   $0.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Senior Unsecured Term Loan 
    
  On May 3, 2016, we closed on a new   five  -year   $100 million   senior unsecured term loan.  The interest rate on the term loan is based on a pricing grid ranging from   145   to   220   basis points over LIBOR, based on the Company s leverage ratio. The financial covenants of the term loan are identical to the covenants on our senior unsecured credit facility, which are described above. The total proceeds from the term loan were used to repay a portion of the   $75 million   in borrowings then outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility and to repay the   $48.1 million   mortgage loan secured by the Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue.  
    
  The applicable margin is based upon the Company s leverage ratio, as follows:  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company's leverage ratio was   22.1%  . Accordingly, interest on our borrowings under the term loan will be based on LIBOR plus   145   basis points for the following quarter. We incurred interest on the facility of   $0.5 million   and   $0.8 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

9.  Dispositions 
    
  On   June 8, 2016  , we sold the   485  -room Orlando Airport Marriott to an unaffiliated third party for a contractual sales price of   $63 million  . We received net proceeds of approximately   $65.4 million   from the transaction, which included credit for the hotel's capital replacement reserve. We recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of the hotel of approximately   $3.4 million  .  
    
  On   June 30, 2016  , we sold the   821  -room Hilton Minneapolis to an unaffiliated third party for a contractual sales price of   $140 million  . The buyer assumed the   $89.5 million   mortgage loan secured by the hotel. We received net proceeds of approximately   $54.8 million   from the transaction, which included credit for the hotel's working capital. We recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of the hotel of approximately   $4.9 million  .

On   July 7, 2016  , we sold the   169  -room Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City to an unaffiliated third party for a contractual sales price of   $65.0 million  .  We received net proceeds of approximately   $63.3 million   from the transaction. We recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of the hotel of approximately   $2.0 million  . 
    
    Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include the following pre-tax income (loss), inclusive of the gain on sale, from the hotel properties sold during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

10.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities and other financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , in thousands, is as follows: 

_______________ 
    
           (1) 
    The carrying amount of debt is net of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
       
  The fair value of our mortgage debt is a Level 2 measurement under the fair value hierarchy (see Note 2).  We estimate the fair value of our mortgage debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at estimated market rates. The carrying value of our other financial instruments approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

11.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
     Litigation 
    
  We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters.  While it is not possible to ascertain the ultimate outcome of such matters, management believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings brought against the Company, however, is subject to significant uncertainties.  
    
     Other Matters 
    
  In February 2016, the Company was notified by the franchisor of one of its hotels that as a result of low guest satisfaction scores, the Company is in default under the franchise agreement for that hotel. The Company is proactively working with the franchisor and the manager of the hotel to develop and execute a plan to improve the guest satisfaction scores. While the franchisor has reserved all of its rights under the franchise agreement, including the right to terminate the franchise agreement in the future, no action to terminate the franchise agreement has been taken by the franchisor.  In addition, the lender that holds the mortgage on this hotel received notice of the foregoing. The lender has provided written notice to the Company that although it has the right to call an event of default under the loan agreement after a notice and cure period has elapsed, the lender is not doing so but reserves all of its rights under the loan agreement. While the Company is working diligently with the franchisor and manager to develop an action plan to resolve the matter, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful. If the Company is not successful, the franchisor may seek to terminate the franchise agreement and the lender may seek to declare an event of default under the loan agreement, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operation.

  Overview 
    
  DiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused Maryland corporation operating as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ). As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a portfolio of   26   premium hotels and resorts that contain   9,461   guest rooms located in 17 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  As an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by the hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel. 
    
  Our vision is to be a highly professional public lodging REIT that delivers long-term returns for our stockholders which exceed long-term returns generated by our peers. Our goal is to deliver long-term stockholder returns through a combination of dividends and enduring capital appreciation. Our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation, focus on high quality lodging properties in North American markets with superior growth prospects and high barriers-to-entry, aggressively asset manage those hotels, and employ conservative amounts of leverage.  
    
  Our primary business is to acquire, own, asset manage and renovate full-service hotel properties in the United States. Our portfolio is concentrated in key gateway cities and destination resort locations. Each of our hotels is managed by a third party and a substantial number of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies, including Marriott International, Inc. and Hilton Worldwide. 
    
  We critically evaluate each of our hotels to ensure that we own a portfolio of hotels that conforms to our vision, supports our mission and corresponds with our strategy. On a regular basis, we analyze our portfolio to identify opportunities to invest capital in certain projects or market non-core assets for sale in order to increase our portfolio quality. We are committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. We regularly assess the availability and affordability of capital in order to maximize stockholder value and minimize enterprise risk.  In addition, we are committed to following sound corporate governance practices and to being open and transparent in our communications with our stockholders. 
    
  Key Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance 
    
  We use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include: 

Occupancy percentage; 

Average Daily Rate (or ADR); 

Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR); 

Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA; and 

-   16  - 

Table of Contents  

Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO. 
       
          Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately   72%   of our total revenues for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms. 
    
  Our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands. 
    
  We also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Results of Operations 
    
  Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenue  .  Revenue consists primarily of the room, food and beverage and other operating revenues from our hotels, as follows (dollars in millions):   

Our total revenues decreased $18.3 million from   $238.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $220.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease includes amounts that are not comparable quarter-over-quarter as follows: 
    
     $5.5 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016. 
     $14.9 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016. 
     $3.6 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016. 
    
  Excluding these non-comparable amounts our total revenues increased $5.7 million, or 2.7%. 
    
  The following are key hotel operating statistics for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The 2015 amounts reflect the period in 2015 comparable to our ownership period in 2016 for the Orlando Airport Marriott, Hilton Minneapolis, and Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City.  

The increase in room revenue is a result of a 3.7% increase in group business and a 21.7% increase in the contract segment, partially offset by a 2.8% decrease in the business transient segment.  
    
  Food and beverage revenues decreased $3.3 million from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , which includes amounts that are not comparable quarter-over-quarter as follows: 
    
     $1.8 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016. 
     $5.0 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016. 
     $0.1 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016. 
    
  Excluding these non-comparable amounts, food and beverage revenues increased $3.6 million, or 8.9%, primarily driven by an increase in banquet revenue. 
    
  Other revenues, which primarily represent spa, parking, resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees, increased by $0.3 million, driven primarily by higher resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees.  
    
  Hotel operating expenses.   The operating expenses consisted of the following (dollars in millions):

Our hotel operating expenses decreased $14.9 million from   $165.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $150.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in hotel operating expenses includes amounts that are not comparable quarter-over-quarter as follows: 
    
     $4.6 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016. 
     $10.5 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016. 
     $2.2 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016. 
    
  Excluding the non-comparable amounts, hotel operating expenses increased $2.4 million, or 1.6%, from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased   $1.5 million  , or 6.0%, from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Hotel acquisition costs.   We incurred $0.5 million of hotel acquisition costs during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Corporate expenses.   Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors  fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $1.3 million, from   $6.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $4.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease includes the reversal of $0.7 million of previously recognized compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of equity awards related to the resignation of our former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The remaining decrease is primarily due to lower employee-related costs and lower legal fees.  
    
  Interest expense.   Our interest expense was   $9.5 million   and   $12.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and comprises the following (in millions):

The decrease in mortgage debt interest expense is primarily related to refinancing a portion of our total debt at lower interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate for our debt decreased from 4.50% as of   September 30, 2015   to   3.72%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Income taxes.   We recorded an income tax expense of   $4.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $4.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   includes $4.3 million of income tax expense on the $10.5 million pre-tax income of our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, and $0.1 million of state franchise taxes.  We incurred less than $0.1 million of income tax expense on the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   includes $4.4 million of income tax expense incurred on the $11.0 million pre-tax income of our TRS, $0.4 million of foreign income tax benefit incurred on the $1.0 million pre-tax loss of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef, and $0.2 million of state franchise taxes. 
    
  Frenchman s Reef is owned by a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a TRS and is subject to U.S. Virgin Island (USVI) income taxes. We were party to a tax agreement with the USVI that reduced the income tax rate to approximately 7%. The agreement expired on February 14, 2015. The income tax expense related to the TRS that owns Frenchman s Reef reflects the statutory rate of 37.4% from July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. In October 2015, we were granted a 15-year extension of the tax agreement, which is retroactive to the expiration date of the prior agreement.

The decrease in mortgage debt interest expense is related to refinancing a portion of our total debt at lower interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate for our debt decreased from 4.50% as of   September 30, 2015   to   3.72%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Income taxes.   We recorded an income tax expense of   $11.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $8.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The income tax expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes $10.6 million of income tax expense on the $25.8 million pre-tax income of our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS,  $0.6 million of foreign income tax expense incurred on the $8.1 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef and $0.2 million of state franchise taxes. The income tax expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   includes $6.8 million of income tax expense on the $16.7 million pre-tax income of our TRS, $1.5 million of foreign income tax expense incurred on the $6.0 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef and $0.3 million of state franchise taxes.

In October 2015, we were granted a 15-year extension of the tax agreement, which is retroactive to the expiration date of the prior agreement.  
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund distributions to our stockholders to maintain our REIT status as well as to pay for operating expenses and capital expenditures directly associated with our hotels,  
  
   -   23  - 

Table of Contents  

funding of share repurchases under our share repurchase program, debt repayments upon maturity and scheduled debt payments of interest and principal. We currently expect that our available cash flows, which are generally provided through net cash from hotel operations, existing cash balances, equity issuances, proceeds from new financings and refinancings of maturing debt, proceeds from property dispositions, and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.  
    
           Some of our mortgage debt agreements contain  cash trap  provisions that are triggered when the hotel s operating results 
  fall below a certain debt service coverage ratio. When these provisions are triggered, all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio is reached and maintained for a certain period of time. Such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the cash trap provision was triggered on the mortgage loan secured by the Lexington Hotel New York. 
    
  Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels,  renovations, and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels, scheduled debt payments, debt maturities and making distributions to our stockholders. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including cash provided by operations, borrowings, issuances of additional equity and/or debt securities and proceeds from property dispositions. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including the state of the credit markets, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders. Our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets, investor sentiment and intended use of proceeds. We may need to raise additional capital if we identify acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives and require liquidity in excess of existing cash balances. Our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on, among other things, general market conditions for hotel companies and REITs and market perceptions about us. 
    
  Our Financing Strategy 
    
  Since our formation in 2004, we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. The majority of our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate mortgage debt.  We have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide balance sheet flexibility. We expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle. We believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through the use of a highly leveraged capital structure. 
    
  We prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure. We have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock. We structure our hotel acquisitions to be straightforward and to fit within our capital structure; however, we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available. 
    
  We believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $923.0 million   of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   3.72%   and a weighted average maturity date of approximately   5.7   years.  We maintain one of the most durable and lowest levered balance sheets among our lodging REIT peers.  We maintain balance sheet flexibility with limited near-term debt maturities, capacity under our senior unsecured credit facility and 17 of our   26   hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt. We remain committed to our core strategy of maintaining a simple capital structure with conservative leverage. 
    
  Information about our financing activities is available in Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
     Share Repurchase Program 
    
  Our board of directors approved a share repurchase program in November 2015 authorizing us to repurchase up to   $150 million   in shares of our common stock. Information about our share repurchase program is found in Note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had repurchased   92,600   shares of our common stock at an average price of   $8.90   per share for a total purchase price of   $0.8 million  . Subsequent to   September 30, 2016   and through November 8, 2016, we repurchased an additional   516,162   shares of our common stock at average price of   $8.92   per share for a total purchase price of   $4.6 million  . We retired all repurchased shares on their respective settlement dates. As of November 8, 2016, we have   $144.6 million   of authorized capacity remaining under our share repurchase program.  
    
     Short-Term Borrowings

Other than borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, discussed below, we do not utilize short-term borrowings to meet liquidity requirements.  
    
  Senior Unsecured Credit Facility 
    
  We are party to a   $300 million   senior unsecured credit facility expiring in   May 2020  . Information about our senior unsecured credit facility is found in Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility.  
    
  Senior Unsecured Term Loan 
    
  We are party to a $100 million senior unsecured term loan expiring in May 2021. Information about our senior unsecured term loan is found in Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  Our principal sources of cash are net cash flow from hotel operations and borrowings under mortgage debt, term loans, our senior unsecured credit facility and proceeds from hotel dispositions. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties, debt service, debt maturities, capital expenditures, operating costs, corporate expenses and dividends. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $236.0 million   of unrestricted corporate cash and   $47.7 million   of restricted cash, as well as borrowing capacity under our senior unsecured credit facility. 
    
  Our net cash provided by operations was   $152.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Our cash from operations generally consists of the net cash flow from hotel operations offset by cash paid for corporate expenses and other working capital changes. 
    
  Our net cash provided by investing activities was   $107.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which consisted of   $183.5 million   of net proceeds from the sale of the Orlando Airport Marriott, Hilton Minneapolis and Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, the net return of   $3.1 million   from lender reserves, offset by capital expenditures at our hotels of   $78.7 million  . 
    
  Our net cash used in financing activities was   $238.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which consisted of our   $249.8 million   repayment of the mortgage debt secured by the Chicago Marriott and Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue,   $75.6 million   of dividend payments,   $1.5 million   paid to repurchase shares under our share repurchase program and upon the vesting of restricted stock for the payment of tax withholding obligations,   $2.8 million   of financing costs related to our senior unsecured credit facility and term loan, and   $8.4 million   of scheduled mortgage debt principal payments, partially offset by   $100.0 million   of proceeds from our senior unsecured term loan. 
    
  We currently anticipate our significant source of cash for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016 will be the net cash flow from hotel operations. We expect our estimated uses of cash for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016 will be potential share repurchases, regularly scheduled debt service payments, capital expenditures, dividends, and corporate expenses.  
    
  Dividend Policy 
    
  We intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends at least equal to our REIT taxable income to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings (other than the earnings of our TRS, which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates) and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to REITs under the Code. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least: 

90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, plus 

90% of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code, minus 

any excess non-cash income. 
       
  The timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors, including our financial performance, restrictions under applicable law and our current and future loan agreements,

Table of Contents  

our debt service requirements, our capital expenditure requirements, the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. 
    
  We have paid the following dividends to holders of our common stock during 2016: 

Capital Expenditures 
    
  The management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement funds to cover, among other things, the cost of replacing and repairing furniture, fixtures and equipment at our hotels and other routine capital expenditures. Contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues. In addition, we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management or franchise agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have set aside $39.8 million for capital projects in property improvement funds, which are included in restricted cash.  
    
  We spent approximately   $78.7 million   on capital improvements during the nine months ending   September 30, 2016  , primarily related to the second phase of the Chicago Marriott Downtown renovation, the first phase of the renovation of The Gwen and the Worthington Renaissance guest room renovation.  We expect to spend approximately $130 million on capital improvements at our hotels in 2016. Significant projects in 2016 include: 

The Gwen, a Luxury Collection Hotel:   We rebranded the Conrad Chicago to Marriott's Luxury Collection brand on September 1, 2015. The renovation work associated with the brand conversion will be completed in two phases. The first phase, consisting of the lobby, rooftop bar and other public spaces, commenced in January and was completed in May 2016. The second phase of the renovation, consisting of the guest rooms, will be completed during the seasonally slow winter season beginning in late 2016.  
                
    Chicago Marriott Downtown:   The second and largest phase of the multi-year renovation was completed early in the second quarter of 2016. This phase included the upgrade renovation of approximately 460 guest rooms as well as construction of a new state-of-the-art fitness center. The remaining guest rooms are expected to be renovated during the seasonally slow winter months over the next two years.  
                
    The Lodge at Sonoma:   We expect to renovate the guest rooms at the hotel during the seasonally slow period during late 2016 and early 2017. 
                
    Charleston Renaissance:   We expect to renovate the guest rooms at the hotel during the seasonally slow period from the end of the year through early 2017.  
                
    Worthington Renaissance:   We have commenced the guest room renovation at the hotel and expect to complete the project at the end of 2016. 
       
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
    
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
    
  We use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company. 
    
  Use and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

-   26  - 

Table of Contents  

Our management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.  
    
  These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. 
    
  EBITDA and FFO 
    
  EBITDA represents net income excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from  our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. 
    
  The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), which defines FFO as net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets.  The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results. 
    
  Adjustments to EBITDA and FFO 
    
  We adjust EBITDA and FFO when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO, when combined with U.S. GAAP net income, EBITDA and FFO, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated operating performance.  We adjust EBITDA and FFO for the following items: 

Non-Cash Ground Rent  : We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight line recognition of rent from our ground lease obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable lease assets. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period.  
                
    Non-Cash Amortization of Favorable and Unfavorable Contracts  : We exclude the non-cash amortization of the favorable and unfavorable contracts recorded in conjunction with certain acquisitions because the non-cash amortization is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period. 
                
    Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle  : Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  We exclude the effect of these adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect the Company's actual underlying performance for the current period. 
                
    Gains or Losses from Early Extinguishment of Debt  : We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because these gains or losses result from transaction activity related to the Company's capital structure that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company or our hotels. 
                
    Hotel Acquisition Costs  :  We exclude hotel acquisition costs expensed during the period because we believe these transaction costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.

Severance Costs  :  We exclude corporate severance costs incurred with the termination of corporate-level employees and severance costs incurred at our hotels related to lease terminations because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. 
                
    Hotel Manager Transition Costs  :  We exclude the one-time transition costs associated with a change in hotel manager because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we excluded the transition costs associated with the change of hotel managers in connection with the acquisition of the Westin Fort Lauderdale and the Shorebreak Hotel. 
                
    Other Items  :  From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.  Such items may include, but are not limited to, the following: pre-opening costs incurred with newly developed hotels; lease preparation costs incurred to prepare vacant space for marketing; management or franchise contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; bargain purchase gains incurred upon acquisition of a hotel; and gains from insurance proceeds.  
       
  In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA we exclude gains or losses on dispositions and impairment losses because we believe that including them in EBITDA does not reflect the ongoing performance of our hotels. Additionally, the gain or loss on dispositions and impairment losses are based on historical cost accounting and represent either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA. 
    
  In addition, to derive Adjusted FFO we exclude any fair value adjustments to debt instruments.  We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company. Specifically, we exclude the impact of the non-cash amortization of the debt premium recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of the JW Marriott Denver at Cherry Creek and fair market value adjustments to the Company's interest rate cap agreement.

  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe that the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies, including certain critical accounting policies, are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
    
  Inflation 
    
  Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  The operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location, and accordingly, we expect some seasonality in our business. Volatility in our financial performance from the seasonality of the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
       
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business strategies, the primary

market risk to which we are currently exposed, and, to which we expect to be exposed in the future, is interest rate risk. The face amount of our outstanding debt as of   September 30, 2016   was   $930.0 million  , of which $270.4 million was variable rate.  If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt fluctuate by 25 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, depending on rate movement, future earnings and cash flows, by $0.7 million annually. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  The Company s management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances that information we disclose in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
    
  There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters.  While it is not possible to ascertain the ultimate outcome of such matters, management believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings brought against the Company, however, is subject to significant uncertainties. 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
       
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

    Represents amounts available under the Company's $150 million share repurchase program. To facilitate repurchases, we make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise may be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The share repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.  
              (3) 
    Since September 30, 2016, we have continued to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our $150 million share repurchase program, which was originally announced on November 5, 2015. Between October 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016, we repurchased an additional   516,162   shares of our common stock at an average price of   $8.92   per share for a total purchase price of   $4.6 million  .  We retired all repurchased shares on their respective settlement dates.  As of November 8, 2016, we have   $144.6 million   of authorized capacity remaining under our share repurchase program.
