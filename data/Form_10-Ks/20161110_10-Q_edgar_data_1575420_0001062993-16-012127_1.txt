MJP INTERNATIONAL LTD.  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED
INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      For the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
  NOTE 1    NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF
OPERATIONS    
 MJP International Ltd. ( MJP  or the  Corporation ) was
incorporated in the state of Nevada, United States on October 24, 2012. 
 The Corporation, through its subsidiaries MJP Lighting
Solutions Ltd. ( MJP BVI ) and MJP Holdings Ltd. ( MJP Alberta ) specializes in
the sale and distribution of LED lighting and technology solutions and is
focused on the North American market. MJP Alberta has set up an agency in
Guangzhou, China in search of high quality products offered by reputable
manufacturers to be introduced to Canada.  
  Going Concern   
 These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Corporation and its
subsidiaries will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations
for the next fiscal year. Realizable values may be substantially different from
carrying values as shown and these condensed interim consolidated financial
statements, which do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to
the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the
Corporation be unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2016, the
Corporation had not yet achieved profitable operations and has accumulated
losses of $284,128 since its inception. The Corporation expects to incur further
losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt
about the Corporation s ability to continue as a going concern. The
Corporation s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due. Management anticipates that additional
funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of common stock.
Management may also seek to obtain short-term loans from the directors of the
Corporation. There are no current arrangements in place for equity funding or
short-term loans.  
  NOTE 2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES    
 This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to
assist in understanding the condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
The condensed interim consolidated financial statements and notes are the
representations of the Corporation s management, who is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. The condensed interim consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q,
and therefore do not include all the information necessary for a fair
presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These condensed
interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
annual consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the
Corporation s filed Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

NOTE 2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONT.)  
 
 Basis of Presentation   
 
The Corporation s condensed interim consolidated financial statements included herein are prepared under the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
condensed interim consolidated financial statements include the Corporation s wholly owned subsidiaries MJP Lighting Solutions Ltd. and MJP Holdings Ltd. and 100 percent of their assets, liabilities and net income or loss. All inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
 
While the information presented in the accompanying condensed interim three month consolidated financial statements is unaudited, it includes all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operation and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be
expected for the year ended June 30, 2017. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 
The Corporation adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Corporation as they are issued, which may be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any recently issued,
but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements.  
 
In August 2014, the FASB issued amended standards No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (''ASU 2014-15"), to provide guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures requirement. The amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation for each annual and interim reporting
period, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the
annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its condensed interim
consolidated financial position.  

MJP INTERNATIONAL LTD.   
 NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
 
  NOTE 2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)   
 In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), an update to ASU 2014-09. This ASU amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
  2017 (fiscal 2019). Subsequently, the FASB has also issued accounting standards updates which clarify the guidance. This ASU removes inconsistencies, complexities and allows transparency and comparability of revenue transactions across entities,
  industries, jurisdictions and capital markets by providing a single comprehensive principles-based model with additional disclosures regarding uncertainties. The principles-based revenue recognition model has a five-step analysis of transactions to
  determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
  be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018). In transition, the ASU may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or
  retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Corporation is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified statement of
financial position. This ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively to all periods presented for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal
2018), with early adoption permitted, and may require additional disclosure based on the application method selected. The Company prospectively early adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Corporation does not expect the adoption of
this guidance will have a material impact on its condensed interim consolidated financial position.  
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis
and available for sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation does not expect the
adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its condensed interim consolidated financial position.  
 
In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses
the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of
certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Corporation does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its condensed interim consolidated financial position.

  Products and Services   
  Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)   
 Light-emitting diode, commonly known as LED, is a solid-state
semiconductor technology that is rapidly gaining momentum in the lighting
industry. Early market for LEDs was driven by specific niche markets, mainly
backlighting, that optimized on the products  colored light and small package
size. From backlighting, the product slowly made inroads into the automotive
industry. Today, the focus of the industry has largely been shifted towards
general lighting. LED applications are evolving quickly into viable sources for
general illumination as they promise many benefits over conventional lighting.
Within the past few years, LED technology has improved significantly with
respect to brightness, energy efficiency, and color quality and consistency.
Branded as a disruptive technology, LED has played a tremendous role in
revolutionizing the lighting industry. LEDs have the following attributes:  
 
    Efficiency . LEDs have exceptionally high theoretical energy
  efficiency. They can produce much higher lumen per watt than conventional
  technologies, thus providing energy savings up to 50 to 70%.
    Lifespan . The materials used in making LEDs are inherently stable.
  High quality LEDs may last for 50,000 to 100,000 hours or more. Unlike
  conventional lighting technologies, lifespan of an LED is unaffected by rapid
  cycling, its lifespan actually increases when the average current flowing
  through it is reduced.
    Controllability . LEDs have superior control over light color,
  intensity, and direction. Newer white LEDs bring the potential to illuminate
  public spaces, homes and offices with light that mimics daylight. The
  controllability of LED- generated light enables intelligent light systems,
  making them better suited to smart controls than any previous light
  technology.
    Durability . LEDs are extremely durable; and are resistant to
  vibration, mechanical stress, and extreme weather conditions whereby
  conventional lighting solutions are at a disadvantage.
    Environmentally Friendly . LEDs do not contain toxic materials such
  as mercury, a necessary component of fluorescent bulbs.   
 Today s LEDs boast many benefits over conventional
technologies. In addition to the many objective advantages mentioned above, they
also provide social benefits that play an important role in enhancing human
emotions, motivation, abilities, health, and perception of public safety.  
  MJP International s LED Products   
 Through our Canadian subsidiary, MJP Holdings, we currently
sell LED products in Canada primarily to retail clients (end users) or through
agents. To date, the majority of our products sold in Canada have been sold
through two independent agents, ECCOS Lifestyle Ltd. and PSL Enterprises Ltd.,
both of Calgary, Alberta. In June, 2013, through our wholly owned British Virgin
Island subsidiary, MJP Lighting Solutions, we made a sale to an end user in Hong
Kong. Our company has established relationships with and has purchased most of
our products from two suppliers in Southern China, Gysun Opto-Electronic Co.
Ltd. and Odin Optoelectronics Technology Co., Limited. To date, our sales have
consisted primarily of LED tube lights, LED PAR (parabolic aluminized reflector)
lamps for spot lights, and LED down lights. These products are certified for
sale in North America with UL  (Underwriters Laboratories) or CSA  (Canadian
Standards Association). All of these products have numerous applications in both
commercial and residential structures and offer a number of benefits over both
incandescent and fluorescent lighting products.  
 5  

PAR Series   
 The LED PAR Series bulb is a replacement bulb for traditional
PAR 30/38 lamps, where typically halogen bulbs are used. Diameter and length are
identical to traditional lighting products; however, the mid-section is wider to
allow necessary thermal management. Normally this difference is accommodated by
the standard fixtures. The LED bulb is available with either a spot or wide beam
lens and can be used in recessed, track and pendant lighting. Traditionally, the
PAR light series has two product alternatives: halogen lamps and compact
fluorescent lamps (CFLs). LED PAR Series are superior in many ways over these
two product alternatives. Both the halogen and CFL bulbs operate at higher
wattages resulting in higher yearly power consumption and heat emissions.
Furthermore, halogen and CFL lighting products are also deficient in luminosity
(light intensity) and longevity.  
  Down Light   
 The LED Down Light series is a complete lighting fixture with
bulb and installation housing. The model has three variations: recessed, narrow
spot, and wide beam; allowing for a wide range of applications. The LED Down
Light series  lack of heat output and spot capabilities make this product ideal
for display lighting. However the fixtures can also be used in any commercial
office space or residential dwelling.  
 The Down Light series bulb is superior in many ways over the
halogen and CFL lighting products. However, a feature that truly sets the LED
Down Light product apart from its alternatives is that the bulb is available in
both a wide and narrow beam model; allowing the product a greater amount of
versatility over alternative lighting products.  
  Tube Series   
 The LED Tube series products are designed to replace
fluorescent lamps and fit into existing light fixtures. The new LED lighting
products are easy to install and require only some minor wiring adjustments,
which includes removing the now obsolete ballasts. As well, the LED Tube series
pins can be configured for horizontal or vertical lighting and are available in
either clear or frosted lenses.  
 The LED Tube series contains many advantages over traditional
fluorescent tube lighting. Overall product performance is far superior; they are
capable of starting at much colder temperatures, and do not flicker or hum like
traditional fluorescent tubes tend to do. Quality of light is also much better,
and both wattage and yearly power consumption is much lower. LED Tube series
products also do not require a ballast like traditional fluorescent tubes do,
and last significantly longer resulting in a substantial decrease in
installation and maintenance costs.  
  Results of Operations  
   Operating Expenses   
 Our operating expenses for the three month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the period from July 19, 2010 (inception)
to September 30, 2016, are outlined in the table below: 
 
 6  

Revenues    
 We earned revenue of $5,432 for the three month period ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $Nil for the three month period ended September
30, 2015. The absence of sales for the three month period ended September, 2015
is primarily due to a drop in our marketing activities due to lack of capital.
Our gross profit from sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2016
was $914 compared to our nominal gross profit of $Nil for the three month period
ended September, 2015. From our inception on July 19, 2010 through September 30,
2016 we have earned revenues of $110,834, incurred costs of goods sold and
operating expenses of $86,263 and $305,333, respectively, resulting in a
cumulative net loss of $282,097.  
   Operating Expenses   
 Our consolidated expenses for the three month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the period from July 19, 2010 (inception)
to September 30, 2016, are outlined in the table below: 

Our general and administrative expenses include rent, telephone
and internet services, banking changes and miscellaneous office supply costs.
Our professional fees include legal and accounting fees. Our general and
administrative expenses were $3,245 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to $9,222 for the same period in 2015. The overall decrease in
expenses from $9,222 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $4,909
for the same period in 2016 is due to lower operation costs. From our inception
on July 19, 2010 through September 30, 2016 we have incurred total expenses of
$305,333 consisting of general and administrative expenses of $138,083,
professional fees of $109,035, and salaries and wages of $58,215. 
   Earnings after Taxes    
 The net loss for the three month period ended September 30,
2016 was $3,995 compared to a net loss of $9,222 during the three month period
ended September 30, 2015. The decreased loss for the three month period ended
September 30, 2016 is primarily due is due to the cost reducing measures
implemented by our management.  
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As at September 30, 2016, we were obligated to related parties,
including Chris Tong Tang, our president, chief executive officer and director
and a number of shareholders, for $132,136 (June 30, 2016 $130,482) in funds
advanced to us for working capital. The advances are unsecured, non-interest
bearing and no payback schedule has been established.    
 7  

At September 30, 2016, our company had a cash balance and total
assets of $1,567 compared with a cash balance and total assets of $936 as at
June 30, 2016. 
 As at September 30, 2016, our company had total liabilities of
$154,940 compared with $151,571 as at June 30, 2016. The nominal increase of
$1,715 was attributed to an increase in trades and other payables, and by an
increase amount of $1,654 due to related parties.  
 As at September 30, 2016, our company had a working capital
deficit of $153,373 compared with a working capital deficit of $150,635 as at
June 30, 2016. 
 
   Cash Flow from Operating Activities    
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our company
received $773 of cash in operating activities compared with $314 used during the
same period in 2015. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was
primarily due to a decrease in operating activities, such as sales and
marketing, resulting from a lack of capital available to support such
activities. Since July 19, 2010 (inception) to September 30, 2016 we have used
net cash of $139,209 in our operating activities. 
   Cash Flow from Financing Activities    
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our
company did not receive any cash for financing activities. We did not engage in
any financing activities during the most recent three month period. From July
19, 2010 (inception) through September 30, 2016 we have received $114,188 from
financing activities. 
   Cash Flow from Investing Activities    
 We have not engaged in any investing activities since
inception. 
  Going Concern  
 We incurred a net loss of $282,097 during the period from
inception (July 19, 2010) to September 30, 2016. We have commenced limited
operations, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. We will seek additional sources of capital through the issuance of debt
or equity financing, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in
accomplishing our objectives.  
 Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on
additional sources of capital and the success of our plan. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of
liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 8  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to our stockholders. 
  Estimated Expenses   
 Our expenses for the twelve month period beginning from October
1, 2016 are estimated to be approximately $60,000. With our working capital
deficit of $153,373 as at September 30, 2016, we will need to raise additional
capital to cover our expenses for the twelve month period beginning October 1,
2016. We plan to raise additional funding either from new share issuance or from
loans from shareholders.  
 
 At present, our cash requirements for the next 12 months
(beginning October 1, 2016) outweigh the funds available to maintain or develop
our business. Of the $60,000 that we require for the next 12 months, we have
only nominal cash on hand and a working capital deficit of $153,373 as at
September 30, 2015. In order to improve our liquidity, we plan to pursue
additional equity financing from private investors or possibly a registered
public offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements in place
for the completion of any further private placement financings and there is no
assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement
financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then
we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and
administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources
that are available to us. 
 We have not investigated the availability of commercial loans
or other debt financing to supplement or meet our cash requirements. In the
uncertain event that any such debt financing alternatives were available to us
on acceptable terms, they would increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments. 
 If we are able to raise the required funds to fully implement
our business plan, we plan to implement the business actions in the order
provided below. If we are not able to raise all required funds, we will
prioritize our corporate activities as chronologically as follows:  
 October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017:  
 
   Maintain company s filing requirements.
   Market our services to our various contacts.
   Carry out marketing activities.
   Seeking partnership or strategic relationship with other distribution
  companies.   
  Future Financings  
 We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares
and funding from directors and shareholders in order to continue to fund our
business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to
existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund
our operations and other activities.

Critical Accounting Policies   
 The summary of significant accounting policies is presented to
assist in understanding the interim consolidated financial statements. The
interim consolidated financial statements and notes are the representations of
our company s management, who is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, and therefore do not include all
the information necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results
of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. The interim consolidated financial statements, included herein,
should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in our company s filed Form 10-K. 
  Basis of Presentation   
 Our company s interim consolidated financial statements
included herein are prepared under the accrual basis of accounting in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These interim consolidated financial statements include our company s wholly
owned subsidiaries MJP Lighting Solutions Ltd. and MJP Holdings Ltd. and 100% of
their assets, liabilities and net income or loss. All inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. 
 While the information presented in the accompanying interim
three months consolidated financial statements is unaudited, it includes all
adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operation and cash flows for the
interim periods presented. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Operating results for the period ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ended June 30, 2016.
 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-9,  
   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606   ( ASU
2014-9 ). ASU 2014-9 is intended to enhance comparability of revenue recognition
practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets,
improve disclosure to help users of financial statements better understand the
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized, and
provide guidance for transactions that are not currently addressed
comprehensively. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, and does not allow for early
adoption. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or
modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard. Our company
has begun the evaluation of the impact that the standard will have on its
consolidated financial statements but has not yet selected a transition
method.
