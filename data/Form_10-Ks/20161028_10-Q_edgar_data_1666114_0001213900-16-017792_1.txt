NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS    

We
were incorporated as Unleashed Inc. (the Company) on March 5, 2015 in the State of Nevada for the purpose of designing, distributing
and selling swim, surf and open water related products to customers.  

Mr.
Ridding operated the business as a sole proprietor under the dba  Unleashed Hardware Inc.  He started the business
on December 2, 2014 when he purchased a computer, started working on product designs, and the Company s website. Mr. Ridding
contributed the business assets and liabilities of his sole proprietorship into Unleashed Inc.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
Company was incorporated, for the purpose of designing, distributing and selling swim, surf and open water related products to
customers.  

The
Company has elected March 31 as its fiscal year end.  

Basis
of presentation   

The
Company reports revenue and expenses using the accrual method of accounting for financial and tax reporting purposes. The accompanying
unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission set forth in Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial
statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share   

Basic
net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding. Diluted
net income (loss) per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares
outstanding as if shares had been issued on the exercise of any common share rights unless the exercise becomes antidilutive and
then only the basic per share amounts are shown in the report.  

Estimates
and Assumptions   

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing
these financial statements.  

Accounts Receivable  

The Company records accounts receivable at
the net value of the face amount of customer invoices less any allowance for doubtful accounts. We evaluate our accounts receivable
periodically based on specific identification of any accounts receivable for which we deem the net realizable value to be less
than the gross amount of accounts receivable recorded; in these cases, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for those
balances. In determining our need for an allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical experience, analysis of past due
amounts, client creditworthiness and any other relevant available information. However, our actual experience may vary from our
estimates. If the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability or unwillingness to pay
our fees, we may need to record additional allowances or write-offs in future periods. The Company mitigates this risk by collecting
retainers from our clients prior to performing significant services. 

The Company records an allowance for doubtful
accounts, if any, as a reduction in revenue to the extent the provision relates to fee adjustments and other discretionary pricing
adjustments. To the extent the provision relates to a client's inability to make required payments on accounts receivables, the
provision is recorded in operating expenses. As of September 30, 2016 there was no allowance for doubtful accounts, and we did
not record any bad debt expense during the period from Inception (May, 5 2015) through September 30, 2016.

  Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements  

  For the Three and Six Months Ended September
30, 2016  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
functional currency of the Company is Great British Pounds (GBP). Monetary assets and liabilities of our operations are translated
into United States dollar equivalents using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. While nonmonetary assets and
liabilities in addition to common stock and additional paid in capital are translated at historical rate. Revenues, expenses and
retained earnings are translated using the average exchange rates during each period. Adjustments resulting from the process of
translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income in stockholders  equity. As of September 30, 2016, these amounts were immaterial, and the total foreign currency
translation losses included in other comprehensive income was $1,649.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial
statements.  

NOTE
3 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   

Property
consists of equipment purchased for the production of revenues. As of:  

Assets
are depreciated over their useful lives beginning when placed in service. Depreciation expenses were $152 and $349 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended March 31, 2016 respectively.  

NOTE
4 - PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES   

The
reconciliation of income tax provision (benefit) at the U.S. statutory rate of 34% for the six months ended September 30, 2016
and for the six months ended September 30, 2015 to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:  

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and
March 31, 2016 are as follows:  

Unleashed Inc.  

  Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements  

  For the Three and Six Months Ended September
30, 2016  

The
Company has approximately $18,226 of net operating losses ( NOL ) carried forward to offset taxable income, if any,
in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2035. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance
against all the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized.  

NOTE
5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

The
Company is not presently involved in any litigation.  

NOTE
6 - GOING CONCERN   

As
set forth on the Company's balance sheet, its assets total $20,743 and $7,197 as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 respectively.
These amounts do not provide adequate working capital for the Company to successfully operate its business and to service its
debt. Expenses incurred to the date of this prospectus are being recorded on the Company's books as they occur. This raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining
additional working capital. Management believes that the Company will be able to operate for the coming year by obtaining additional
loans from Mr. Ridding and from equity funding. However, there can be no assurances that management's plans will be successful.  

NOTE
7 - SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES   

On
March 5, 2015, the Company s founder, President and CEO, Anthony Ridding, acquired all the 15,000,000 common shares issued
by the Company, at a price of $0.001 per share.  

NOTE
8 - CAPITAL STOCK

Company was incorporated on March 5, 2015 in Nevada with authorized capital of 100,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock.  

On
March 5, 2015, the Company issued 15,000,000 shares of common stock to the founder for cash proceeds of $15,000.

2. Management's Discussion and Analysis  .  

Forward-Looking
Statements   

Management's
statements contained herein are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material adverse
effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to, those matters
discussed under the section entitled  Risk Factors,  above. Such risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating
forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  

Company
Overview   

We
were incorporated as Unleashed Inc. on March 5, 2015 in the State of Nevada for the purpose of designing, distributing and selling
swim, surf and open water related products to customers. Our office address is Kassalova 33, 949 01 Nitra, Slovakia, our phone
is +42 123 6760 and our website is www.unleashedhardware.com.  

Commencing
in December 2014, Mr. Anthony Ridding, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, initially operated the business as a sole proprietor
under the dba  Unleashed Hardware Inc.  Thereafter, on or about March 5, 2015, he contributed the business assets
and liabilities of his sole proprietorship to the Company. The first sales occurred in August 2015.  

Since
inception the Company has successfully designed, tested and refined our Stand Up Paddleboard and Swim Tow Floats outsourced to
manufacturers in China, created and launched our website www.unleashedhardware.com, established distribution channels for our
products through our web-site and other third parties, and commenced the commercial sale of our products. The first sales of both
of these products occurred in August 2015. We currently produce and sell two main products:  

(1)
  Stand-up Paddleboard  . Our stand up paddleboard (referred to as SUP) is inflatable and made from reinforced PVC.
The device includes a carbon fiber paddle, hand pump, removable fin, carry bag, and repair kit. The board is 11 feet in length
and designed for use by individuals with a weight of up to 120 Kgs (265 lbs).  

(2)
  Dry Bag and Tow Float  . Our dry bag and tow float is an inflatable floatation device with dry storage. The bag consists
of a two-part inflatable 35liter storage system, connected to the swimmers waist by straps and towed behind by a leash. Storage
is typically used for items such as food, clothing and communication devices. From a safety aspect, the bag can be used as a flotation
device for fatigued swimmers and is bright orange in color to act as a safety beacon to other water users. The design of the product
allows for participants to function without disruption to swimming.  

Our
products have been designed in Slovakia by our President and manufactured in China. In addition, our products are currently distributed
from the UK and payment taken in pounds sterling. We have payment facilities on our website, eBay and a number of products for
sale in retail outlets on a sale or return basis.  

Results
of Operations for the three and six months to September 30, 2016   

Revenues    

Our
total revenue reported for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,672 and $1,236 respectively. Our total revenue
reported for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,792 and $1,236 respectively. Most of our revenues have occurred
on third-party e-commerce sites and via our e-commerce website.  

We
expect revenues to increase for the year ended March 31, 2017 as a result of increased sales resulting from improved marketing
and increased production. Subject to our ability to raise sufficient funds, we hope develop our own e-commerce site in an effort
to increase revenues.  

Cost
of Goods Sold    

Our cost of goods sold for the three months
to September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $1,040, respectively. Our cost of goods sold for the six months to September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $479 and $1,040, respectively. Our costs of goods sold decreased for the three and six months to September 30, 2016
as the company sold services in the current period compared to selling goods in the three and six months to September 30, 2015. 

Gross
Profit/(loss)    

Gross
profit for the three months to September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,672 and $196, respectively. Gross profit for the six months
to September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,314 and $196, respectively  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses were $10,279 and $1,202 for the three months to September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating expenses were $13,670
and $4,436 for the six months to September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  

Our
operating expenses for the three months to September 30, 2016 and consisted of depreciation in the amount of $69 and $91, respectively,
general and administrative expenses of $272 and $648 respectively and professional fees of $9,938 and $463, respectively.  

Our
operating expenses for the six months to September 30, 2016 consisted of depreciation in the amount of $152 and $179, respectively,
general and administrative expenses of $1,166 and $3,794 respectively and professional fees of $12,351 and $463, respectively.  

We
anticipate our operating expenses will increase as we undertake our plan of operations. The increase will be attributable to the
measures described above to implement our business plan and the professional fees associated with our becoming a reporting company
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

Net
Loss    

Net
loss for the three months to September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $577 and $1,006, respectively. Net loss for the six months to September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $4,356 and $4,240, respectively  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $20,087, consisting of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts receivable and inventories.
We had current liabilities of $1,459 consisting of accounts payable as of September 30, 2016. Accordingly, we had a working capital
surplus of $18,628 as of September 30, 2016.  

Operating activities used $18,218 and $11,479
in cash for the six months to September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We
expect to spend approximately $240,000 toward the initial implementation of our business plan over the course of our next full
fiscal year. On September 30, 2016, we had $7,185 in cash. The success of our business plan therefore depends on raising funds
through the current offering. If the maximum offering is sold, we should have sufficient cash to carry out our business plan until
March 31, 2017. If substantially less than the maximum offering is sold, however, our ability to execute on our immediate business
plan will be impaired. Our ability to operate beyond March 31, 2017, is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing and/or
upon realizing sales revenue sufficient to fund our ongoing expenses. Until we are able to sustain our ongoing operations through
sales revenue, we intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund
our capital expenditures, working capital, or other cash requirements. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for
the sales of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing
will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.  

Current
Offering.    

We
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2016 pursuant to which we
registered an offering ( Offering ) to raise up to $250,000 in gross proceeds from sale of our common stock at a price
per share of $0.005 (for a total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock). The registration statement was declared effective on April
15, 2016. As of the date of this report, we have sold 4,365 shares of our common stock in the offering and raised $21,825 in offering
proceeds.  

Plan
of Operations.    

As
mentioned above, we estimate that we need the $240,000 to implement our business plan. This amount is broken down as follows;
$105,000 for a facility and materials and additional inventory, $90,000 for product development and $50,000 for legal, accounting
and advertising and marketing. In addition, we will be required to pay legal, audit and professional fees as we meet our reporting
obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe this will cost us approximately $25,000 for the next twelve
months. Therefore our projected operating costs for the next 12 months is $240,000 assuming we raise sufficient funding.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had current assets in the amount of $20,743 and current liabilities in the amount of $1,459. Accordingly,
we had working capital surplus of $18,628 as of September 30, 2016. Our current working capital along with our revenues is not
sufficient to enable us to implement our business plan as set forth herein. Our expenses for the referenced offering are estimated
at $10,000, and we will need a minimum of $52,500 for the next twelve months. As such, our monthly burn rate for the next twelve
months is estimated at $4,500. We will need to sell a minimum of 25% of the offering for net proceeds of $52,500 in order to meet
our financial obligations. Our ability to remain in business with less than $52,500 in this offering is questionable.  

Based
on our current burn rate, we will run out of funds by December 2016 without additional capital and assuming revenues based on
past performance during that period. If we fail to raise sufficient funds in this offering, investors may lose their entire cash
investment. The Company s business plans do not include selling the Company to a private entity through a business combination
or reverse merger transaction should the Company fail to raise sufficient funds in this offering. Management believes that the
Company will be able to operate for the coming year by obtaining additional loans from our directors and from equity funding.
Although we have not reached a formal agreement or understanding with our directors, we have been informed that Mr. Ridding is
willing to provide an additional $60,000 over the next 12 months, assuming Mr. Ridding does not experience any personal financial
difficulties during that period of time. There are no guarantees however that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to
continue to operate during the next 12 months. Moreover, the Company will be required to seek additional equity funding in the
form of private or public offerings of its common stock in the future which may cause substantial dilution to existing shareholders.  

Going
Concern   

Our
assets at September 30, 2016 total $20,087. This amount does not provide adequate working capital for us to successfully operate
our business. Expenses incurred to the date of this prospectus are being recorded our books as they occur. This raises substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional
working capital. Management believes that we will be able to operate for the coming year by obtaining loans from Mr. Ridding and
from equity funding, via proceeds raised from the offering set forth in this prospectus. However there can be no assurances that
management's plans will be successful.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Current
Offering    

We
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2016 pursuant to which we
registered an offering to raise up to $250,000 in gross proceeds from sale of our common stock at a price per share of $0.005
(for a total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock). The registration statement was declared effective on April 15, 2016. As of
the date of this report, we have sold 4,365,000 shares of our common stock in the offering and raised $21,825 in offering proceeds.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
We do not believe that any accounting policies currently fit this definition.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

We
do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flow.

4. Controls and Procedures .   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we undertook an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure (a) that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (b) that information required to be disclosed is accumulated
and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  

Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  A company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

In
making its assessment, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, used the criteria set
forth in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission ( COSO ).  

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  We
have identified revenue reporting was a quantitative material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as
of the end of second quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31,
2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  

This
annual report on Form 10-Q for the quarter to September 30, 2016 does not include an auditor attestation report on our internal
controls over financial reporting inasmuch as no attestation report was required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission applicable to us as in effect at that time.
