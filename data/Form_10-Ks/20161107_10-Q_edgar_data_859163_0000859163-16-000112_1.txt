1. Basis of Presentation: 

The   consolidated financial statements of AVX Corporation and its subsidiaries ( AVX  or the  Company ) include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. We have prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (     SEC     ) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals, necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated balance sheets, operating results, comprehensive income   (loss)  , and cash flows for the periods presented.     Operating results for the three   and six month   period  s   ended   September   30, 201  6   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 201  7   due to   changes in economic conditions and   other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.     These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  . 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: 

We have identified the accounting policies and estimates that are critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations. Those policies and estimates can be found in Note 1,      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ,      of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  ,      in  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  . Accordingly, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  . During the   three   and six   month period  s   ended   September   30, 201  6  , there were no significant changes to any critical accounting policies or to the methodology used in determining estimates including those related to investment securities, revenue recognition, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, income taxes, and contingencies. 

New Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .    This guidance modifies the financial reporting of revenue and how an entity will determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides for a five-step approach in applying the standard: 1) identifying the contract with the customer, 2) identifying separate performance obligations in the contract, 3) determining the transaction price, 4) allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations, and 5) recognizing the revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied. The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures for the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is being recognized. The guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU   2014-09. Early adoption is   permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-2,  Leases  .    This guidance changes the inclusion of certain right-of-use assets and the associated lease liabilities to be included in a statement of financial position. The classification criteria maintains the distinction between finance leases and operating leases. Regarding financial leases, lessees are required to 1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position, 2) recognize interest on the lease liability separate from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income, and 3) classify repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Regarding operating leases, lessees are required to 1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position, 2) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis, and 3) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

6   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  .    The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The guidance is effective for public companies   for   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

We have reviewed other newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to our business or that no material effect is expected on our consolidated financial statements as a result of future adop  tion. 

2. Earnings Per Share: 

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of (a) the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and (b) the dilutive effect of potential common stock equivalents during the period. Stock options are the only common stock equivalents currently used in our calculation and are computed using the treasury stock method. 

The table below represents the basic and diluted   earnings per share and sets forth the   weighted average number of shares of common st  ock outstanding   and   the dilutive effect of   potential common stock equivalents: 

(1) Common stock equivalents not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would have been antidilutive were   3,003   shares and   1,966   shares for the three months ended   September   30  , 20  1  5   and 201  6  , respectivel  y     and   2,436     shares   and   2,230     shares   for the six months     ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

3. Trade Accounts Receivable: 

Charges related to allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. Charges related to stock rotation, ship from stock and debit, sales returns  ,   and sales discounts are reported as deductions from revenue. 

7   

4. Fair Value: 

Fair Value Hierarchy: 

The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to value the assets or liabilities.     Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:  

- 

Level 1  : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.     

- 

Level 2  : Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.     

- 

Level 3  : Unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.     

During the three     and six   month period  s   ended   September   30,   201  5 and 2016  , there have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels within the fair value hierarchy. 

8   

9   

(1) The market value of the assets held in the trust for the non-qualified deferred compensation program is included as an asset and as a liability as the trust s assets are both assets of the Company and also a liability as they are available to general creditors in certain circumstances. 

(2)   Foreign currency derivatives in the form of forward contracts are included in   prepaid and other   and accrued expenses   in the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).     Realized gains and losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges   are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as revenues and costs of sales  ,   and gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in   other income. 

Valuation Techniques: 

The following describes valuation techniques used to appropriately value our assets held in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan and derivatives. 

Assets held in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan 

Assets valued using Level 1   and Level 2   inputs in the table above represent assets from our non-qualified deferred compensation program.     The funds in the non-qualified deferred compensation program are valued based on the number of shares in the funds using a price per share traded in an active market. 

Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and whether or not we expect to recover the security's entire amortized cost basis. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in   the investment is established. 

Derivatives 

We primarily use forward contracts, with maturities generally less than four months, designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions related to purchase commitments and sales, denominated in various currencies. We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures.     These derivatives are used to offset currency changes in the fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities. Fair values for all of our derivative financial instruments are valued by adjusting the market spot rate by forward points, based on the date of the contract.     The spot rates and forward points used are an average rate from an actively traded market. At March 31, 201  6   and   September    3  0  , 201  6  , all of our forward contracts are   valued using   Level 2 measurements. 

5. Financial Instruments and Investments in Securities: 

At March 31, 2016 and September   30, 2016, we classified investments in debt securities and time deposits   as held-to-maturity securities. 

10   

Our long-term and short-term investment securities are accounted for as held-to-maturity securities and are carried at amortized cost. We have the ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity. All income generated from the held-to-maturity securities investments a  re recorded as interest income. 

Investments in held-to-maturity securities, recorded at amortized cost, were as follows: 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of h  eld-to-maturity investments at September   30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. The estimated fair value of these investments are based on valuation inputs that include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker and dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities bids, offers, and reference data, which are Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. 

6. Inventories: 

11   

7  . Commitments and Contingencies: 

We have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), state governmental agencies or other private parties as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) or equivalent state or local laws for clean-up and response costs associated with certain sites at which remediation is required with respect to prior contamination. Because CERCLA or such state statutes authorize joint and several liability, the EPA or state regulatory authorities could seek to recover all clean-up costs from any one of the PRPs at a site despite the involvement of other PRPs. At certain sites, financially responsible PRPs other than AVX also are, or have been, involved in site investigation and clean-up activities. We believe that liability resulting from these sites will be apportioned between AVX and other PRPs. 

To resolve our liability at the sites at which we have been named a PRP, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees with federal and state regulatory agencies governing the timing and nature of investigation and remediation. As is customary, the orders and decrees regarding sites where the PRPs are not themselves implementing the chosen remedy contain provisions allowing the EPA to reopen the agreement and seek additional amounts from settling PRPs in the event that certain contingencies occur, such as the discovery of significant new information about site conditions. 

O  n June 3, 2010, AVX entered into an agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford, pursuant to which AVX is required to perform environmental remediation at a site referred to as the  Aerovox Site  (the  Site ), located in New Bedford, Massachusetts. AVX has substantially completed its obligations pursuant to such agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford with respect to the satisfaction of AVX s federal law requirements. Agreements with the state regulatory authorities have yet to be concluded but are likely to include additional groundwater   and soil   remediation.   W  e have a remaining accrual of    $  1  5,  482    a  t    September   30, 201  6  , represent  ing   our estimate  , including a   $3,600   charge in the   prior   quarter,   of the potential liability related to the remaining performance of environmental remediation actions at the Site   using certain assumptions   regarding the plan of remediation  .   Since additional sampling and analysis may cause the state regulatory authority, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, to require   a    more extensive and costly   plan of   remediation,   until all parties agree and remediation is complete, we cannot be certain there will be no additional cost   relating to the Site  . 

We had   total   reserves of approximately    $  1  6,809   and $  19,974    a  t March 31, 201  6   and   September    3  0  , 201  6  , respectively, related to  various   environmental   matters  .   These reserves are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as    $  7,409   and $  4,480   in accrued expenses at March 31, 201  6   and   September   30, 201  6  , respectively,   and     $9,400   and $  15,494   in other non-current liabilities at March 31, 201  6   and   September   30,   201  6  , respectively  . The amount  s   recorded for   these   iden  tified contingent liabilities are   based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional legal and technical information that becomes available. Also, uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, regulatory actions, technology, and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure. Accordingly, these costs could differ from our current estimates. 

On April 19, 2016, the Canadian Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the  MoE ) issued a Director s Order naming AVX Corporation  ,   as well as others  ,   as responsible parties with respect to a location in Hamilton, Ontario that was the site of operations of Aerovox Canada, a former subsidiary of Aerovox Corporation, a predecessor of AVX. This Director s Order follows a draft order issued on November 4, 2015. AVX has taken the position that any liability of Aerovox Canada for such site under the laws of Canada cannot be imposed on AVX. At present, it is unclear whether the MoE will seek to enforce such Canadian order against AVX, and whether, in the event it does so, AVX will have any liability under applicable law. AVX intends to contest any such course of action that may be taken by the MoE. 

We also operate on other sites that may have potential   future   environmental issues as a result of activities at sites during AVX s long history of manufacturing operations or prior to the start of operations by AVX. Even though we may have rights of indemnity for such environmental   matters   at certain sites, regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues. Once it becomes probable that we will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated, we establish reserves or adjust our reserves for our projected share of these costs. A separate account receivable is recorded for any indemnified costs. Our environmental reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries, which are not expected to be significant, but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple  -  party sites or indemnification of our liability by a third party. 

On April 25, 2013, AVX was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned   Greatbatch, Inc. v AVX Corporation  . This case alleged that certain AVX products infringe on one or more of nine Greatbatch patents.   On January 26, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the first  

12   

phase of a segmented trial and found damages to Greatbatch in the amount of   $37,500  . AVX is reviewing this initial verdict, consulting with its legal advisors on what action AVX may take in response, and continuing to litigate the rest of the case. 

On September 2, 2014, a subsidiary of AVX, American Technical Ceramics ( ATC ), was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court   for   the District of Delaware captioned   Presidio Components, Inc. v. American Technical Ceramics Corp.   This case   alleged   that certain products of ATC s infringe on a Presidio patent.   On April 18, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and found damages to Presidio in the amount of   $2,168  .    On August 17, 2016, the   C  ourt issued a permanent injunction prohibiting ATC from manufacturing or selling the related product after November 16, 2016 and awarded Presidio damages related to ATC s sale of such products from February 21, 2016 through November 16, 2016. Subsequently, on October 21, 2016, the Federal Circuit   C  ourt granted AVX s request for a stay of the permanent injunction whereby AVX may continue to sell the disputed product until March 17, 2017 to anyone who was a customer prior to June 17, 2016. Any sales subsequent to November 16, 2016 pursuant to the stay of the permanent injunction are subject to the intellectual property damages award discussed above.     AVX is   taking a  n estimated   reserve   for damages   on all   pre- and   post-verdict sales of product subject to that litigation in the event that the verdict withstands future challenges.   AVX is   appealing the verdict. 

We had total reserves of   $39,668   and   $54,930   as of March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, related   to the two intellectual property cases discussed above. The amounts recorded are based on estimated outcomes. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information that becomes available. Accordingly, these costs could differ from our current estimates.  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, AVX was named as a co-defendant in a series of cases filed in the United States and   in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia   alleging violations of United States, Canadian, and state antitrust laws asserting that AVX and numerous other companies   we  re participants in alleged price-fixing in the capacitor market. The cases in the United States   were   consolidated into the Northern District of California   on October 2, 2014.     During the quarter ended December 31, 2014,   additional   Canadian cases   were   filed in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario  , British Columbia, Saskatchewan   and   Manitoba   and these cases are at the initial stages  .   AVX believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend the cases. 

We are involved in   other   disputes, warranty   claims  , and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. While we cannot predict the outcome of these   other   disputes and proceedings, management believes, based upon a review with legal counsel, that none of these proceedings will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), or cash flows.     However, we cannot be certain of the eventual outcome, and any adverse result in these or other matters that may arise from time to time, may harm our financial position, results of operations, comprehensiv  e income (loss), or cash flows. 

8  . Comprehensive Income (Loss): 

Comprehensive income (loss) represents changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders. The specifi  c components include net income  , pension liability and other post-retirement benefit adjustments, deferred gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments   and   unrealized gains and losses on qualified foreign currency cash flow hedges. 

Other comprehensive income (loss) includes the following components:    

13   

A  mounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income     include   those that pertain to the Company     s pension and postretirement benefit plans   and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  .

9  . Segment and Geographic Information: 

Our operating segments are based on the types of products from which we generate revenues.   We are organized into a product line organization with five main product groups and   three reportable segments: Passive Components, KED Resale, and Interconnect. The product groups of Ceramic, Advanced, and Tantalum have been aggregated into the Passive Components reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria and quantitative thresholds. The aggregation criteria consist of similar economic characteristics, products and services, production processes, customer classes, and distribution channels.  The Passive Components segment consists primarily of surface mount and leaded ceramic capacitors, RF thick and thin film components, surface mount and leaded tantalum capacitors, surface mount and leaded film capacitors, ceramic and film power capacitors, super capacitors, EMI filters (bolt in and surface mount), thick and thin film packages of multiple passive integrated components, varistors, thermistors, inductors, and resistive products manufactured by   AVX   or purchased from other manufacturers for resale. The KED Resale segment consists primarily of ceramic capacitors, frequency control devices, SAW devices, sensor products, RF modules, actuators, acoustic devices, and connectors produced by Kyocera and resold by AVX. The Interconnec  t segment consists primarily of   automotive, telecom, and memory connectors manufactured by   or for   AVX Interconnect.  Sales and operating results from these reportable segments are shown in the tables below. In addition, we have a corporate administration group consisting of finance, legal, EHS, and administrative activities.   

We evaluate performance of our segments based upon sales and operating profit. There are no intersegment revenues.   We allocate the costs of shared resources between segments based on each segment     s usage of the shared resources.   Cash, accounts receivable, investments in securities, and certain other assets, which are centrally managed, are not readily allocable to operating segments. 

14   

The tables below present information about reported segments: 

15   

The following geographic data is based upon net sales generated by operations located within particular geographic are  as. Substantially all of the sales in the Americas region were generated in the United States. 

10. Pension Plans: 

Net periodic pension cost for our defined benefit plans consisted of the follow  ing for the three and six months ended September   30, 2015 and 2016: 

Based on current actua  rial computations, during the six   months ended September   30, 2016, we made contributions of $  3,578   to the international plans. We expect to make additional contributions of approximately   $3,572   to the international plans over the remainder of fiscal 2017. We made   $3,001     in   contributions   to the U.S. plans during the six months ended September   30, 2016  . W  e    do not   anticipate making   any contributions to the U.S. plans during the remainder of the fiscal year.

11  . Derivative Financial Instruments: 

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We use derivative instruments (forward contracts) to hedge certain foreign currency exposures as part of our risk management strategy. The objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities. We do not enter into any trading or speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments. 

We primarily use forward contracts, with maturities less than   four   months, designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions related to purchase commitments and sales, denominated in various currencies. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. 

The effectiveness of the cash flow hedges is determined by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged transaction, both of which are based on forward rates. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these cash flow hedges is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders  equity. Once the hedged transaction is recognized, the gain or loss is recognized in our statement of operations. At March 31, 201  6   and September   30, 201  6  , respectively, the following forward contracts were entered into to hedge against the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates for certain forecasted sales and purchases.

For these derivatives designated as hedging instruments, during the three   and six months ended September   30, 201  6  , net pre-tax   gains     (losses)   of $  (31)     and   $30  , respectively,   were recognized in other comprehensive income   (loss)  . In addition, during the three   and six months ended September   30, 201  6  , net pre-tax   gain  s    (losses)   of $  404     and   $     (825)  , respectively,   were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into cost of sales (for hedging purchases), and net pretax   gains (  losse  s  )   of $  442     and   $    (176)  , respectively,   were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into sales (for hedging sales) in the accompanying statement of operations. 

17   

Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments consist primarily of forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. These hedging instruments are used to offset foreign currency changes in the fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other income in the same period as the remeasurement gains and losses of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and thus naturally offset these gains and losses. At March 31, 201  6   and September   30, 201  6  , we had the following forward contracts that were entered into to hedge against these exposures.

For these derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging instruments during the three   and six months ended September   30, 201  6  ,    gain  s    (losses)   of $  (149)     and   440  , respectively o  n hedging contracts were recognized in other income, along with the approximately   $307     and   $(2,357)     in exchange   gains (  losse  s  )   that were recognized in other income in the accompanying statement of operations. 

At March 31, 201  6   and September   30, 201  6  , we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $  204,372   and $  220,883  , respectively, denominated primarily in   E  uros, Czech   K  orunas, British   P  ounds, and Japanese   Y  en. 

12  . Subsequent Events: 

On   October     19  , 201  6  , the Board of Directors of the Company declared a $  0.  1  1   dividend per share of common stock with r  espect to the quarter ended   September   30  , 201  6  . The dividend will be paid to stockholders of record on   November     7  , 201  6     and will be disbursed on   November     18  , 201  6  .

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management     s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      is based upon our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto   contained in this Form 10-Q  , which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to investment securities, revenue recognition, inventories, property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes  ,   and contingencies. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 

We have identified the accounting policies and estimates that are critical to our business operations and understanding the Company     s results of operations. Those policies and estimates can be found in Note 1,      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     , in  Management     s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6   and in Note 1,      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Accordingly, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  . During the three     and six   month period  s   ended   September   30  , 201  6  , there were no significant changes to any critical accounting policies, judgments involved in applying those policies, or the methodology used in determining estimates with respect to those related to investment securities, revenue recognition, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, income taxes, and contingencies.

Virtually all types of electronic devices use our passive component products to store, filter, or regulate electric energy. We also manufacture and supply high-quality electronic connectors and interconnect systems for use in electronic products. 

We have manufacturing, sales, and distribution facilities located throughout the world, which are divided into three main geographic regions: the Americas, Asia, and Europe. AVX is organized into five main product groups with three reportable segments: Passive Components, KED Resale, and Interconnect. The Passive Components segment consists primarily of surface mount and leaded ceramic capacitors, RF thick and thin film components, surface mount and leaded tantalum capacitors, surface mount and leaded film capacitors, ceramic and film power capacitors, super capacitors, EMI filters (bolt in and surface mount), thick and thin film packages of multiple passive integrated components, varistors, thermistors, inductors, and resistive products   manufactured by   AVX   or purchased from other manufacturers for resale  . The   KED Resale segment consists primarily of ceramic capacitors, frequency control devices, SAW devices, sensor products, RF modules, actuators, acoustic devices, and connectors produced by Kyocera and resold by AVX. The Interconnect segment consists   primarily   of automotive, telecom, and memory connectors manufactured by   or for AVX  . 

Our customers are multi-national original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, independent electronic component distributors, and electronic manufacturing service providers, or EMSs. We market our products through our own direct sales force and independent manufacturers      representatives, based upon market characteristics and demands.

Results of Operations - Three Months Ended   September   30  , 201  5   and 201  6 

Our net income for the quarter ended   September   30  , 201  6   was $  26.5   million,   or $  0.16   per share, compared to $  27.9   million,   or $  0.17   per share, for the q  uarter ended   September   30  , 201  5  . 

Net sales in the three months ended   September   30  , 201  6     in  creased $  23.1     million   or   7.6%  , to $  327.5     million   compared to $  304.4     million   in the three months ended   September   30  , 201  5  .   The increase in revenue was attributable to higher volumes   across all of    our   product groups,   Ceramic Components  ,   KDP and KCD Resale   and Interconnect   products  ,   resulting from steadily improving global market conditions reflecting higher overall demand, primarily in the cellular telecommunications  , consumer,   and automotive markets. In addition, t  his   in  crease is partially a result of the strength of the Japanese   Y  en   against the U.S. Dollar   which     favorably impacted sales by $  1.6   million when compared to the same period last year. 

Profit from operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 includes charges of $12.8 million related to previously disclosed intellectual property damages awards resulting from litigation with respect to a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by Presidio Components, Inc.   ( Presidio ).   This case alleged that certain American Technical Ceramics Corp. (ATC, a subsidiary of AVX) products infringe on a Presidio patent. On April 18, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and found damages to be paid to Presidio in the amount of $2.2 million, which was accrued as of March 31, 2016. In addition, at that time the Court indicated that it was considering awarding  

20   

additional damages on product sales; however, no amounts were disclosed by the court of any potential award.  We made an estimate of the probable amount of the award and accrued $2.5 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 on sales of the affected product.  Subsequently, on August 17, 2016, the Court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting ATC from manufacturing or selling the related product after November 16, 2016 and awarded Presidio   additional   damages related to ATC s sale of such products from February 21, 2016 through November 16, 2016. Furthermore, on October 21, 2016, the Federal Circuit Court granted AVX s request for a stay of the permanent injunction whereby AVX may continue to sell the disputed product until March 17, 2017 to anyone who was a customer prior to June 17, 2016. Any sales subsequent to November 16, 2016 pursuant to the stay of the permanent injunction are subject to the intellectual property damages award discussed above. The $12.8 million intellectual property damages award charges for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 includes $6.2   million   of damages (over and above our original $2.5 million estimate) related to sales that occurred prior to the beginning of the current quarter and $6.6 million of damages which related to sales that occurred in the current quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Net sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 includes $2.9 million from increased sales prices related to the affected products which have the effect of partially offsetting the effect of the intellectual property damages awards.  

The net effect of the damages awards and the higher selling prices was a negative impact on net income of $6.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Additionally, profit from operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 reflects a charge of $6.2 million related to the settlement of certain litigation involving legacy environmental issues. 

The table below represents product group revenues for the quarters ended   September   30  ,   201  5   and 201  6  . 

Passive Component  s   sales   in  creased $  5.7     million,   or   2.8%   to $  214.1     million   in the three months ended   September   30, 201  6     compared to sales of    $  208.4     million   during the same quarter last year  .   The sales   in  crease in Passive Components product sales   was driven by increased volume for our Ceramic Compo  nents as a result of   steadily   improving   global market conditions and   our focus on the sale of higher capacitance components  ,    primarily     in the cellular telecommunications, consumer, and automotive markets.   The sales increase in our Advanced Components was primarily attributable to the increased sales of broadband capacitors of approximately $4.0 million, including $2.9 million from increased sales prices, resulting from increased demand by customers in light of the intellectual property litigation discussed above as customers sought to purchase product prior to the   initial   effective date of the November 16, 2016 injunction.   This increase   in Ceramic and Advanced Components products   was partially offset by   slightly   lower volume sales   of   our Tantalum Components  . 

KDP and KCD Resale sales   in  creased $  12.7   million  , or   20.0%  , to $  76.4   million   in the three months ended   September   30, 201  6   compared to $  63.7     million   during the same period last year.   This   in  crease is primarily a result of   higher   demand from our cellular device customers   in addition to a favorable currency impact on reported revenues when compared to the same period last year  . 

21   

Total   Interconnect   product   sales, including AVX Interconnect manufactur  ed and KCP Resale connectors,   in  creased $  4.7   million  , or   14.7%  , to $  36.9     million   in the three months ended   September   30, 201  6   compared to $  32.2    m  illion   during the same period last year.     This   in  crease   is primarily attributable to   increased demand in   the     U.S.     and European automotive markets  . 

Geographically, compared to the same period last year, sales   in  creased in all regions, primarily reflecting   higher   demand   resulting from steadily improving global market conditions   in the electronics market.   Sales in the Asian, American and European markets represented   45.2%  ,    28.4%   and   26.4%   of total sales, respe  ctively, for the quarter ended September   30, 201  6  . This compares to   42.8%  ,    29.5%   and   27.7%   of total sales for the Asian, American, and European regions in the same period last year, respectively. 

Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented   44.6%   of total sales for the three months ended   September   30, 201  6  , compared to   45.6%   for the three months ended   September   30, 201  5  . Overall  ,    distributor activity   in  creased     when compared to the same period last year   as distributors increase  d order activity and inventory intake   during the quarter  . This   in  crease is reflective of   the distributors      customer   demand  , a more balanced inventory pipeline     and     steadily improving   market   conditions  . Our sales to distributor customers involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales  . Such allowance charges were $  6.8   million,   or   4.6%   of gross sales to distributor customers for the three mon  ths ended   September   30, 201  6  ,   and $  7.5   million,   or   5.4%   of gross sales to distributor customers, for the three months ended   September   30, 201  5  .     Applications under such programs for the quarters ended   September   30, 201  6   and 201  5   wer  e approximately $  5.0     million   and $  7.5   milli  on  ,    respectively. This decrease in applications is due to   a recent   system implementation at one of our major distribution customers  . 

Gross profit in the three months ended   September   30  , 201  6   was   18.9%   of sales, or $  61.8     million,   compared to a gross profit margin of   23.6%  , or $  71.8   million,   in the three months ended   September   30  , 201  5  .     This overall de  crease   in dollars   and percent   is primarily attributable to   product mix     and   increased intellectual property     costs     resulting from   intellectual property damages awards related to the ongoing litigation discussed above.  The $12.8 million intellectual property damages award charges for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by $2.9 million from increased sales prices related to the affected products, impacted our gross profit margin percentage by 3.1%. Costs due to currency movement had minimal impact when comparing the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended   September   30  , 201  6   were $  29.0   million,   or   8.9%   of net sales, compared to $  27.9   million,   or   9.2%   of net sales, in the three months ended   September   30,   201  5  .    The overall   in  crease in these expenses   is primarily due to   higher s  elling expenses   resulting from the increase in sales   when compared to the same period last year   partially offset by lower legal fees  . 

I  ncome from operations was $  32.8     million   in the three months ended   September   30, 201  6   compared to $  37.8     million   in the three months ended   September   30, 201  5  .     This de  crease was a result of the factors described above  . 

Other income, net was   $2.7   million for the quarter ended September   30, 2016 compared to   $1.5   million for the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to foreign exchange gains resulting from significant currency fluctuations durng the current quarter in addition to a gain on the sale of   an idle facility   of $  1.  6   million. 

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September   30, 201  6   was   25.3%   compared to   29.0%   for the three months ended   September   30, 2015  .    The   de  crease in the effective tax rate is principally due   to   increased availability of   certain   tax deductions in the U.S. in the current year and a change in the mix of income to overall lower tax rate jurisdictions in the current year   when compared to the same period last year  . 

As a result of the factors discussed above, net income for the three month period ended   September   30, 201  6   was $  26.5     million   compared to $  27.9     million   for the same three month period last year. 

Results of Operations - Six Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 

Our net income for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was   $56.4   million, or   $0.34   per share, compared to   $63.5   million, or   $0.38   per share, for the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

22   

Net sales in the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased   $37.4   million or   6.2%  , to   $642.3   million compared to   $604.9   million in the six months ended September 30, 2015.   The increase in revenue was attributable to higher volumes in our Ceramic Components and KDP and KCD Resale products resulting from steadily improving global market conditions reflecting higher overall demand, primarily in the cellular telecommunications and automotive markets. In addition, this increase is partially a result of the currency fluctuations resulting from the annoucement of the vote on the Referendum of the United Kingdom s (U.K.) Membership of the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as  Brexit )   during the three month period ended June 30, 2016,   as the strength of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar favorably impacted sales across all product lines by   $6.2   million when compared to the same period last year. 

Profit from operations for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 includes charges of $15.3 million related to previously disclosed intellectual property damages awards resulting from litigation with respect to a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by Presidio  ,   as discussed above. The $15.3 million intellectual property damages award charges for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 includes $6.2   million   of damages (over and above our original $2.5 million estimate) related to sales that occurred prior to the beginning of the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and $6.6 million of damages which related to sales that occurred in the current quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Net sales for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 includes $2.9 million from increased sales prices related to the affected products which have the effect of partially offsetting the effect of the intellectual property damages awards.  

The net effect of the damages awards and the higher selling prices was a negative impact on net income of $8.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the six month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Additionally, profit from operations was impacted by the accrual of estimated environmental remediation costs and the settlement of certain litigation involving legacy environmental issues during the six month period  s   ended September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015   as discussed below  .    Profit from operations for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 reflects a charge of $3.6 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs resulting from legacy environmental issues at an inactive property. Profit from operations for the six month period ended September 30, 2015 reflects a charge of $6.2 million related to the settlement of certain litigation involving legacy environmental issues.  

The table below represents product group revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. 

23   

Passive Components sales increased   $7.1   million, or   1.7%   to   $425.1   million in the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to sales of   $418.0   million during the same six months last year. The increase in Passive Components product sales was driven by increased volume for our Ceramic Components as a result of steadily improving global market conditions and our focus on the sale of higher capacitance components, in addition to a favorable currency impact on reported revenues when compared to the same period last year.   This increase was partially offset by lower volume sales in our Tantalum Components and Advanced Components resulting from lower volumes in the computer, medical, industrial and telecom   markets.   Partially offsetting the lower sales in our Advanced Components products were increased sales of broadband capacitors of approximately $4.0 million, including $2.9 million from increased sales prices, resulting from increased demand by customers in light of the intellectual property litigation discussed above as customers sought to purchase product prior to the   initial   effective date of the November 16, 2016 injunction. 

KDP and KCD Resale sales increased   $25.1   million, or   21.3%  , to   $143.0   million in the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $117.9   million during the same period last year.   This increase is primarily a result of higher demand from our cellular device customers   in addition to a favorable currency impact on reported revenues when compared to the same period last year  . 

Total Interconnect product sales, including AVX Interconnect manufactured and KCP Resale connectors, increased   $5.2   million, or   7.6%  , to   $74.2   million in the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $69.0   million during the same period last year.   This increase is primarily attributable to increased demand in the U.S. and European automotive markets. 

Geographically, compared to the same period last year, sales increased in all regions, primarily reflecting higher demand resulting from steadily improving global market conditions in the electronics market and a favorable currency impact due to the strength of the Japanese Yen and Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar. Sales in the Asian, American and European markets represented   43.7%  ,    28.9%   and   27.4%   of total sales, respectively, for the six months ended September 30, 2016. This compares to   41.6%  ,    30.1%   and   28.3%   of total sales for the Asian, American, and European regions in the same period last year, respectively. 

Our sales to independent electronic distributor customers represented   45.8%   of total sales for the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to   45.5%   for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Overall, distributor activity increased when compared to the same period last year as distributors increased order activity and inventories. This increase is reflective of the distributors  customer demand, a more balanced inventory pipeline and steadily improving market conditions. Our sales to distributor customers involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales. Such allowance charges were   $14.3   million, or   4.9%   of gross sales to distributor customers  ,   for the six months ended September 30, 2016, and   $14.8   million, or   5.4%   of gross sales to distributor customers, for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Applications under such programs for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately   $9.8   million and   $15.1   million,   respectively. This decrease in applications is due to   a recent system implementation   at one of our major distribution customers  . 

Gross profit in the six months ended September 30, 2016 was   20.5%   of sales, or   $131.7   million, compared to a gross profit margin of   24.6%  , or   $149.0   million, in the six months ended September 30, 2015. This overall decrease in dollars and percent is primarily attributable to product mix reflective of the lower sales of generally higher margin Tantalum and Advanced Components and increased   estimated   intellectual property   damages awards   costs   intellectual property damages awards related to the ongoing litigation discussed above.  The $15.3 million intellectual property damages award charges for the six month period ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by $2.9 million from increased sales prices related to the affected products, impacted our gross profit margin percentage by approximately 2%. D  uring the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , costs  ,   due   the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar,   primarily in reaction to Brexit, were unfavorably impacted by approximately   $9.4   million when compared to the same period last year. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended September 30, 2016 were   $60.5   million, or   9.4%   of net sales, compared to   $56.4   million, or   9.3%   of net sales, in the six months ended September 30, 2015. The overall increase in these expenses is primarily due to higher selling expenses resulting from the increase in sales when compared to the same p  eriod last year  ,   partially offset by   lower   legal fees. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a   $3.6   million charge related to estimated environmental remediation costs resulting from legacy environmental issues at an inactive property. 

24   

Income from operations was   $67.5   million in the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $86.4   million in the six months ended September 30, 2015.   This decrease was a result of the factors described above. 

Other income, net was   $7.8   million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $3.0   million for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to foreign exchange gains resulting from significant currency fluctuations durng the period in addition to a gain on the sale of   an   idle facilit  y   of $  1.6   million. 

Our effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was   25.1%   compared to   29.0%   for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate is principally due to increased availability of certain tax deductions in the U.S. in the current year and a change in the mix of income to overall lower tax rate jurisdictions in the current year when compared to the same period last year. 

As a result of the factors discussed above, net income for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 was   $56.4   million compared to   $63.5   million for the same six month period last year. 

Outlook 

Near-Term: 

With uncertain global geopolitical and economic conditions, it is difficult to quantify expectations for the remainder of fiscal 201  7  . Near-term results for us will depend on the impact of the overall global geopolitical and economic conditions and their impact on telecommunications, information technology hardware, automotive, consumer electronics, and other electronic markets. Looking ahead, visibility is low and forecasting is a challenge in this uncertain and volatile market. We expect to see typical pricing pressure in the markets we serve due to competitive activity. In response to anticipated market conditions, we expect to continue to focus on cost management and product line rationalization to maximize earnings potential.     We also continue to focus on process improvements and enhanced production capabilities in conjunction with our focus on the sales of value-added electronic components to support today s advanced electronic devices. If current global geopolitical and economic conditions worsen, the overall impact on our customers as well as end user demand for electronic products could have a significant adverse impact on our near-term results  . 

Long-Term: 

Although there is uncertainty in the near-term market as a result of the current global geopolitical and economic conditions, we continue to see opportunities for long-term growth and profitability improvement due to: (a) a projected increase in the long-term worldwide demand for more sophisticated electronic devices, which require electronic components such as the ones we sell, (b) cost reductions and improvements in our production processes,     and (c) opportunities for growth in our Advanced Component and Interconnect product lines due to advances in component design and our production capabilities.     We have fostered our financial health and the strength of our balance sheet   putting us in a good position to react to changes in the marketplace as they occur.     We remain confident that our strategies will enable our continued long-term success. 

AVX has reviewed and continues to monitor the impact of   Brexit  .   Beyond the immediate impact to currencies around the world, t  he announcement and resulting effects of Brexit   on AVX and its operations   are difficult to predict   as future trade agreements and other related issues are resolved  .     The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates that resulted in the   weake  ning of the U.S. Dollar against certain foreign currencies  , primarily the Japanese Yen,   in which we conduct business.     Our international sales are denominated in both the U.S. Dollar and curr  encies other than U.S. Dollars.   A fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non  -  U.S. currency transactions. In addition, we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars for our financial statements.     Our reported international sales and earnings could be negatively impacted during periods of foreign currency fluctuation compared to the U.S. Dollar. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, dividend payments, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. Historically, we have satisfied our liquidity requirements through funds from operations and investment income from cash, cash equivalents, and investments in securities. As of   September   30, 201  6  , we had a current ratio of   9.4   to 1, $  1,081.9     million   of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments in securities, $  2,197.6     million   of stockholders  equity, and no debt. 

25   

Net cash   provided by   operating activities was $  104.3     million   in the   six   months ended   September   30, 201  6   compared to $  49.4     million   of cash   used in   operating activities in the   six     months ended   September   30, 201  5  .     In addition to normal changes in working capital, t  he   in  crease in operating cash flow compared to the same period last year was primarily a result   of   a final   payment of $1  22.1 million   made on   May 26, 2015,   related to   a financial settlement with respect to the EPA s ongoing clean-up of the New Bedford Harbor in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  .    

Purchases of property and equipment were $  28.0     million   in the   six   month period ended   September   30, 201  6     and   $  18.9     million   in the   six   month period ended   September   30, 201  5  .     Expenditures   in the   current   year   are   primarily made in connection with the strategic investments in our   corporate headquarters   and plant expansion activities  . We   expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $  17  .0   million   in   the remainder of   fiscal 201  7  . The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end-market demand   and timing of capital projects  . Proceeds from property, plant and equipment dispositions are primarily due to the sale of an idle manufacturing facility in China  . 

The majority of our funding is internally generated through operations and investment income from cash, cash equivalents, and investments in securities. Since March 31, 201  6  , there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commitments for the acquisition or construction of plant and equipment or future minimum lease commitments under noncancellable operating leases. Based on our financial condition as of   September   30, 201  6  , we believe that cash on hand  ,   cash expected to be generated from operating activities and investment income from cash, cash equivalents, and investments in securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital, capital expenditures, environmental clean-up costs,   pension plan funding,   research, development and engineering expenses,   a  cquisitions of businesses, and any dividend payments or stock repurchases to be made during the   next twelve months  . Changes in demand may have an impact on our future cash requirements; however, changes in those requirements are mitigated by our ability to adjust manufacturing capabilities to meet increases or decreases in customer demand. We do not anticipate any significant changes in our ability to generate   capital   or meet our liquidity needs in the   foreseeable future  . 

From time to time we enter into delivery contracts with selected suppliers for certain precious metals used in our production processes. The delivery contracts represent routine purchase orders for delivery within three months and payment is due upon receipt. As of   September   30, 201  6  , we did not have any significant delivery contracts outstanding. 

In addition to the items described below, w  e are involved in   other   disputes, warranty claims, and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, we believe, based upon our review with legal counsel, that none of these proceedings will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), or cash flows.   However, we cannot be certain o  f the eventual outcome and any adverse result in these or other matters that may arise from time to time may harm our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), or cash flows. 

O  n   June 3, 2010, AVX entered into an agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford, pursuant to which AVX is required to perform environmental remediation at a site referred to as the  Aerovox Site  (the  Site ), located in New Bedford, Massachusetts. AVX has substantially completed its obligations pursuant to such agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford with respect to the satisfaction of AVX s federal law requirements. Agreements with the state regulatory authorities have yet to be concluded but are likely to include additional groundwater   and soil   remediation. We have a remaining accrual of $1  5.  5   million   at September   30, 201  6  , representing our estimate  , includin  g a $3.6 million charge in the prior   quarter,   of the potential liability related to the remaining performance of environmental remediation actions at the Site using certain assumptions regarding the plan of remediation. Since additional sampling and analysis may cause the state regulatory authority, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, to require a more extensive and costly plan of remediation, until all parties agree and remediation is complete, we cannot be certain there will be no additional cost relating to the Site. 

We had total   reserves of approximately $1  6.8   million   and   $20   million   at March 31, 201  6   and September   30, 201  6  , respectively, related to various   environmental   matters. These reserves are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as $  7.4   million   and $  4.  5   million   in accrued expenses at March 31, 201  6   and September   30, 201  6  , respectively, and $  9.4 million     and $15.5 million   in other non-current liabilities at March 31, 201  6   and September   30, 201  6  , respectively  . The amounts recorded for   these   identified contingent liabilities are based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional legal and technical information that becomes available. Also, uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, regulatory actions, technology, and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure. Accordingly, these costs could differ from our current estimates. 

26   

On April 19, 2016, the Canadian Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the  MoE ) issued a Director s Order naming AVX Corporation  ,   as well as others  ,   as responsible parties with respect to a location in Hamilton, Ontario that was the site of operations of Aerovox Canada, a former subsidiary of Aerovox Corporation, a predecessor of AVX. This Director s Order follows a draft order issued on November 4, 2015. AVX has taken the position that any liability of Aerovox Canada for such site under the laws of Canada cannot be imposed on AVX. At present, it is unclear whether the MoE will seek to enforce such Canadian order against AVX, and whether, in the event it does so, AVX will have any liability under applicable law. AVX intends to contest any such course of action that may be taken by the MoE. 

We also operate on other sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities at sites during AVX s long history of manufacturing operations or prior to the start of operations by AVX. Even though we may have rights of indemnity for such environmental matters at certain sites, regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues. Once it becomes probable that we will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated, we establish reserves or adjust our reserves for our projected share of these costs. A separate account receivable is recorded for any indemnified costs. Our environmental reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries, which are not expected to be significant, but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple  -  party sites or indemnification of our liability by a third party. 

On April 25, 2013, AVX was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned   Greatbatch, Inc. v AVX Corporation  . This case alleged that certain AVX products infringe on one or more of nine Greatbatch patents.   On January 26, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the first phase of a segmented trial   and   found damages   to   Greatbatch in the amount of $37.5 million. AVX is reviewing this initial verdict, consulting with its legal advisors on what action AVX may take in response, and continuing to litigate the rest of   the case. 

On September 2, 2014, a subsidiary of AVX, American Technical Ceramics ( ATC ), was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned   Presidio Components, Inc. v. American Technical Ceramics Corp.   This case alleged that certain products of ATC s infringe on a Presidio patent.   On April 18, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff   and   found damages   to   Presidio in the amount of $2.2 million.   On August 17, 2016, the court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting ATC from manufacturing or selling the related product after November 16, 2016 and awarded Presidio damages related to ATC s sale of such products from February 21, 2016 through November 16, 2016. Subsequently, on October 21, 2016, the Federal Circuit   C  ourt granted AVX s request for a stay of the permanent injunction whereby AVX may continue to sell the disputed product until March 17, 2017 to anyone who was a customer prior to June 17, 2016. Any sales subsequent to November 16, 2016 pursuant to the stay of the permanent injunction are subject to the intellectual property damages award discussed above.   AVX is taking a  n estimated   reserve   for damages   on all   pre- and   post-verdict sales of product subject to that litigation in the event that the verdict withstands future challenges. AVX is   appealing the verdict. 

We had total reserves of $39.7 million and $54.9 million a  s of   March 31, 2016 and   September    3  0  , 2  016,   respectively, related   to the two intellectual property cases discussed above. The amounts recorded are based on estimated outcomes. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information that becomes available. Accordingly, these costs could differ from our current estimates. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, AVX was named as a co-defendant in a series of cases filed in the United States and in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia alleging violations of United States, Canadian, and state antitrust laws asserting that AVX and numerous other companies   we  re participants in alleged price-fixing in the capacitor market. The cases in the United States were consolidated into the Northern District of California on October 2, 2014. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, additional Canadian cases were filed in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba   and these cases are at the initial stages. AVX believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend the cases.

New Accounting Standards 

Information related to new Statement of Financial Accounting Standards and Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Positions that we have recently adopted or are currently reviewing can be found in Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ,    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  , as well as in Note 1,  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q  . Accordingly, th  is   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  . 

ITEM 3.  

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Our sales are denominated in various foreign currencies in addition to the U.S.   D  ollar. Certain manufacturing and operating costs denominated in local currencies are incurred in Europe, Asia, Mexico, and Central and South America.     Additionally, purchases of resale products from Kyocera may be denominated in Yen. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and cash flow. In order to minimize the effect of movements in currency exchange rates, we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions.     We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Accordingly, we have hedging commitments to cover a portion of our exchange risk on purchases, operating expenses, and sales. There have been no material net changes in our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate as reflected in Part II, Item 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  . See Note 1  1   of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  . 

ITEM 4.    

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the      Exchange Act     ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered in this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclo  sed by us in the reports that we   file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

In addition, there were no changes in our internal control over   financial reporting during   the   second     quarter   of fiscal 201  7   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting  .
