  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016    
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
  Business 
  Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as  Amgen,   the Company,   we,   our  or  us ) is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate in   one   business segment: human therapeutics. 
  Basis of presentation 
  The financial information for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , is unaudited but includes all adjustments (consisting of only normal, recurring adjustments unless otherwise indicated), which Amgen considers necessary for a fair presentation of its condensed consolidated results of operations for those periods. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016. 
  Principles of consolidation 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amgen as well as its majority-owned subsidiaries. We do not have any significant interests in any     variable interest entities. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of estimates 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
  Property, plant and equipment, net 
  Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, of   $7.5 billion   and   $7.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Recent accounting pronouncements and reclassifications 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard that amends the presentation for debt issuance costs. See Note 9, Financing arrangements. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as income tax benefits and expenses in the income statement. See Note 4, Income taxes. Previously, such amounts were recognized as increases and decreases in common stock and additional paid-in capital. This aspect of the standard was adopted prospectively  ,   and accordingly, the Provision for income taxes for the   three and nine months ended     September 30,   2016, includes   $7 million   and   $121 million  , respectively, of excess tax benefits arising from share-based payments. The new standard also amends the presentation of employee share-based payment-related items in the statement of cash flows by requiring (i) that excess income tax benefits and deficiencies be classified in cash flows from operating activities (such amounts were previously included in cash flows from financing activities) and (ii) that cash paid to taxing authorities arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified in cash flows from financing activities (such amounts were previously included in cash flows from operating activities). We adopted the aspects of the standard affecting the cash flow presentation retrospectively, and accordingly, to conform to the current year presentation, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we reclassified: (a)   $247 million   of excess tax benefits from Net cash used in financing activities to Net cash provided by operating activities and (b)   $394 million   of cash paid to taxing authorities arising from withholding of shares from employees from Net cash provided by operating activities to Net cash used in financing activities. 
  
   5 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard that amends the guidance for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers to transfer goods and services. The FASB has subsequently issued additional, clarifying standards to address issues arising from implementation of the new revenue recognition standard. The new revenue recognition standard and clarifying standards are effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and may be adopted earlier, but not before January 1, 2017. The revenue standards are required to be adopted by taking either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact that the revenue standards will have on our consolidated financial statements and determining the transition method that we will apply. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that amends the accounting and disclosures of financial instruments, including a provision that requires equity investments (except for investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that amends the guidance for the accounting and disclosure of leases. This new standard requires that lessees recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet and disclose qualitative and quantitative information about their leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that amends the guidance for measuring and recording credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost by replacing the  incurred loss  model with an  expected loss  model. Accordingly, these financial assets will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This new standard also requires that credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities be recorded through an allowance for such losses rather than reducing the carrying amount under the current, other-than-temporary-impairment model. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , have been reclassified from Accounts payable to Other liabilities within Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions to conform to the current year presentation. 
   
  2. Restructuring 
  We continue to execute on the transformation and process improvement efforts announced in 2014. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The efforts include a restructuring, which is also delivering cost savings and is funding investments. As part of the restructuring, we have exited our facilities in Washington state and Colorado and are reducing the number of buildings we occupy at our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as at other locations. 
  We continue to estimate that we will incur   $800 million   to   $900 million   of pre-tax charges in connection with our restructuring, including (i) separation and other headcount-related costs of   $535 million   to   $585 million   with respect to staff reductions and (ii) asset-related charges of   $265 million   to   $315 million   consisting primarily of asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and other related costs resulting from the consolidation of our worldwide facilities. Through September 30, 2016, we have incurred   $473 million   of separation and other headcount-related costs and   $225 million   of asset-related charges. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs through 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. 
  The amounts related to the restructuring recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were not significant. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total restructuring liability was not significant. 
   
  3. Business combinations 
  Dezima Pharma B.V. 
  On October 14, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Dezima Pharma B.V. (Dezima), a privately-held, Netherlands-based biotechnology company focused on developing innovative treatments for dyslipidemia. Dezima s lead molecule is AMG 899 (formerly TA-8995), an oral, once-daily cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor that has completed certain phase 2 trials. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Upon its acquisition, Dezima became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, and its operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date. 
  
   6 

The aggregate acquisition date consideration to acquire Dezima consisted of (in millions): 
                     Total cash paid to former shareholders of Dezima 
    $ 
    300 
      
      Fair value of contingent consideration obligations 
    110 
      
      Total consideration 
    $ 
    410 

In connection with this acquisition, we are obligated to make additional payments to the former shareholders of Dezima of up to   $1.25 billion   contingent upon the achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. In addition, low-single-digit royalties will be paid on net product sales above a certain threshold. The estimated fair values of the contingent consideration obligations aggregated to   $110 million   as of the acquisition date.     See Note 11, Fair value measurement. 
  The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed included primarily in-process research and development (IPR D) of   $400 million  , goodwill of   $108 million   and deferred tax liabilities of   $100 million  . This valuation reflects delayed development pending competitor clinical trials in this class. 
  Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because the acquisition is not material to our consolidated results of operations. 
   
  4. Income taxes 
  The effective tax rates for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were   16.6%   and   15.9%  , respectively, compared with   15.0%   and   15.3%   for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The effective rates differ from the federal statutory rates primarily as a result of indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. 
  The increase in our effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. 
  The increase in our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and a state tax audit settlement in the prior year. The increase was offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments and discrete benefits associated with tax incentives.  
  Puerto Rico imposes an excise tax on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The rate is   4.0%   effective through December 31, 2017. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred. 
  One or more of our legal entities file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions, the use of tax credits and allocations of income and expenses among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations.  
  We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years ended on or before December 31, 2009, or to California state income tax examinations for years ended on or before December 31, 2008. We are currently under audit in several jurisdictions, including a U.S. federal income tax examination for tax years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments; and their resolution can take many years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Our assessments of uncertain tax benefits are based on information available to us at this time, including estimates and assumptions that have been deemed appropriate by management but may not be representative of final audit resolutions. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) increased by approximately   $115 million   and   $335 million  , respectively, as a result of tax positions taken during the current year. Substantially all of the UTBs as of   September 30, 2016  , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. 
  
   7 

5. Earnings per share 
  The computation of basic earnings per share (EPS) is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares, which include primarily shares that may be issued under our stock option, restricted stock and performance unit award programs, as determined using the treasury stock method (collectively, dilutive securities). 
  The computations for basic and diluted EPS were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the number of anti-dilutive employee share-based awards excluded from the computation of diluted EPS was not significant. 
   
  6. Available-for-sale investments 
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values of available-for-sale investments by type of security were as follows (in millions): 

8 

The fair values of available-for-sale investments by classification in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows (in millions): 

Cash and cash equivalents in the above table excludes cash of   $415 million   and   $406 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The fair values of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities by contractual maturity, except for mortgage- and asset-backed securities that do not have a single maturity date, were as follows (in millions): 

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , realized gains totaled   $215 million   and   $19 million  , respectively, and realized losses totaled   $192 million   and   $58 million  , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, realized gains totaled   $283 million   and   $73 million  , respectively, and realized losses totaled   $313 million   and   $156 million  , respectively. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
  
   9 

The unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments and their related fair values were as follows (in millions): 

The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing securities to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. 
  We review our available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary declines in fair value below our cost basis each quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the cost basis of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below our cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, and the intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future based on new developments or changes in assumptions related to that particular security. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we believe the cost bases for our available-for-sale investments were recoverable in all material respects. 
  
   10 

7. Inventories 
  Inventories consisted of the following (in millions): 

8. Goodwill and other intangible assets 
  Goodwill 
  Changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill were as follows (in millions): 

(1)   
    Consists of goodwill recognized on the acquisition dates of business combinations and subsequent adjustments to these amounts resulting from changes to the acquisition date fair values of net assets acquired in the business combinations recorded during their respective measurement periods. 
     Identifiable intangible assets 
  Identifiable intangible assets consisted of the following (in millions): 

Developed product technology rights consist of rights related to marketed products acquired in business combinations. Licensing rights consist primarily of contractual rights acquired in business combinations to receive future milestones, royalties and profit sharing payments, capitalized payments to third parties for milestones related to regulatory approvals to commercialize products and up-front payments associated with royalty obligations for marketed products. Research and development (R D) technology rights consist of technology used in R D with alternative future uses. Marketing-related intangible assets consist primarily of rights related to the sale and distribution of marketed products. 
  
   11 

IPR D consists of R D projects acquired in a business combination that are not complete at the time of acquisition due to remaining technological risks and/or lack of receipt of required regulatory approvals. As of   September 30, 2016  , the projects include primarily AMG 899, acquired in the acquisition of Dezima (see Note 3, Business combinations); oprozomib, acquired in the acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Onyx); and Parsabiv        (etelcalcetide), acquired in the acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals. 
  All IPR D projects have major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates, including our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not permitted to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require our completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans, as well as competitive product launches, impact the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized value, if any, of these acquired IPR D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. 
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized amortization charges associated with our finite-lived intangible assets of   $371 million   and   $340 million  , respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, we recognized amortization charges associated with our finite-lived intangible assets of   $1.1 billion   and   $1.0 billion  , respectively. The total estimated amortization charges for our finite-lived intangible assets for the remaining three months ending   December 31, 2016  , and the years ending December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, are   $372 million  ,   $1.3 billion  ,   $1.2 billion  ,   $1.1 billion  ,   $1.0 billion   and   $0.9 billion  , respectively. 
  
   12 

9. Financing arrangements 
  The principal amounts, fixed contractual coupon rates and aggregate carrying value of our long-term borrowings were as follows (in millions): 

13 

The principal amounts of notes denominated in foreign currencies in the above table include    550 million   of   4.375%   2018 euro Notes,    675 million   of   2.125%   2019 euro Notes,    1,250 million   of   1.25%   2022 euro Notes,   CHF700 million   of   0.41%   2023 Swiss franc Bonds,    750 million   of   2.00%   2026 euro Notes,    475 million   of   5.50%   2026 pound sterling Notes and    700 million   of   4.00%   2029 pound sterling Notes. 
  There are no material differences between the effective interest rates and coupon rates of any of our borrowings, except for the   4.563%   2048 Notes and the   4.663%   2051 Notes, which have effective interest rates of approximately   6.3%   and   5.6%  , respectively. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we retrospectively adopted a new accounting standard that amends the presentation of debt issuance costs. Such costs are now presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability and not as deferred charges presented as assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of adopting this new accounting standard, our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, was restated to reflect the impact, which reduced both Other current assets and the Current portion of long-term debt by   $3 million   and both Other assets and Long-term debt by   $124 million  . 
  Debt repayments 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repaid the remaining   $1.975 billion   of principal on our Term Loan and the   $750 million   aggregate principal amount of the   2.30%   2016 Notes. 
  Debt issuances 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we issued debt securities in the following offerings: 
     In the event of a change-in-control triggering event, as defined in the terms of the notes, we may be required to purchase all or a portion of these debt securities (as well as the debt exchange issuances discussed below) at a price equal to   101%   of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, all of these debt securities, except for the Swiss franc Bonds, may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and, except as discussed below, a make-whole amount, which is defined by the terms of the notes. The notes may be redeemed without payment of the make-whole amount if redemption occurs during a specified period of time immediately prior to the maturity dates of the notes. Such time periods range from   one   to   six   months prior to the maturity date. 
  Debt exchange 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we completed a private offering to exchange portions of certain outstanding senior notes due 2037 through 2043 (collectively, the Old Notes), listed below, for new senior notes, consisting of principal amounts of   $1.4 billion   of   4.563%   2048 Notes and   $3.5 billion   of   4.663%   2051 Notes (collectively, the New Notes). 
  The following principal amounts of each series of Old Notes were validly tendered and subsequently canceled (in millions): 

The New Notes bear lower fixed coupon rates while requiring higher principal repayments on extended maturity dates, compared with the Old Notes that were exchanged. There were no other significant changes to the terms between the Old Notes  
  
   14 

and the New Notes. The exchange is considered a debt modification, and there were no cash payments to or cash receipts from the note holders as a result of the exchange. Existing deferred financing costs associated with the Old Notes, as well as discounts associated with the New Notes aggregating   $801 million  , will be accreted over the term of the New Notes and recorded as Interest expense, net. Transaction costs of   $24 million   incurred for the exchange were expensed immediately in Interest and other income, net. 
   
  10. Stockholders  equity 
  Stock repurchase program 
  Activity under our stock repurchase program, on a trade date basis, was as follows (in millions): 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.9 billion   remained available under our stock repurchase program. In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of   $5.0 billion   available under the stock repurchase program. 
  Dividends 
  In October 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $1.00   per share of common stock, which will be paid in December 2016. 
  In July 2016, March 2016 and December 2015, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of   $1.00   per share of common stock, which were paid in September 2016, June 2016 and March 2016, respectively.

11. Fair value measurement 
  To estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, we use valuation approaches within a hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is divided into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows: 
                   Level 1 
      
    Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access 
      Level 2 
      
    Valuations for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than level 1 inputs 
      Level 3 
      
    Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

The availability of observable inputs can vary among the various types of financial assets and liabilities. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used for measuring fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for financial statement disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input used that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
  
   16 

The fair value of each major class of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis was as follows (in millions): 

17 

The fair values of our U.S. Treasury securities, money market mutual funds and equity securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets with no valuation adjustment. 
  Most of our other government-related and corporate debt securities are investment grade with maturity dates of     five     years or less from the balance sheet date. Our other government-related debt securities portfolio is composed of securities with weighted-average credit ratings of A- or equivalent by Standard   Poor s Financial Services LLC (S P), Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s) or Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch); and our corporate debt securities portfolio has a weighted-average credit rating of BBB     + or equivalent by S P or Moody s and A- by Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income- and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities; issuer credit spreads; benchmark securities; and other observable inputs. 
  Our residential mortgage-, other mortgage- and asset-backed securities portfolio is composed entirely of senior tranches, with credit ratings of AAA by S P, Moody s or Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income- and market-based approaches for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities; issuer credit spreads; benchmark securities; prepayment/default projections based on historical data; and other observable inputs. 
  We value our other short-term interest-bearing securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value given their near-term maturity dates. 
  
   18 

All of our foreign currency forward and option derivatives contracts have maturities of   three years   or less, and all are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S P or Moody s. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that utilizes an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), swap rates and obligor credit default swap rates. In addition, inputs for our foreign currency option contracts include implied volatility measures. These inputs, where applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 12, Derivative instruments. 
  Our cross-currency swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S P or Moody s. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that utilizes an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, LIBOR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. See Note 12, Derivative instruments. 
  Our interest rate swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S P or Moody s. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by using an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs were observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs included LIBOR, swap rates and obligor credit default swap rates. 
  Contingent consideration obligations 
  As a result of our business acquisitions, we incurred contingent consideration obligations, as discussed below. These contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their estimated fair values, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to product candidates acquired in business combinations and are reviewed quarterly by management in our R D and commercial sales organizations. These inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified regulatory and commercial milestones and estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related regulatory and commercial events, shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events, or increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of these obligations, as applicable. Changes in the fair values of contingent consideration obligations are recognized in Other operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  Changes in the carrying amounts of contingent consideration obligations were as follows (in millions): 

As a result of our acquisition of Dezima in October 2015, we are obligated to pay its former shareholders up to   $1.25 billion   of additional consideration contingent upon achieving certain development and sales-related milestones and low single-digit royalties on net product sales above a certain threshold. The estimated fair values of the contingent consideration obligations had an aggregate value of   $110 million   at acquisition. See Note 3, Business combinations.  
  As a result of our acquisition of BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex), in March 2011, we are obligated to pay its former shareholders up to   $325 million   of additional consideration contingent if certain sales thresholds are achieved within specified periods of time.  
  We estimate the fair values of the obligations to former shareholders of Dezima and BioVex by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we review underlying key assumptions on a quarterly basis.   There were no significant changes in the fair values of contingent consideration obligations   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value measurement levels, and there were no material remeasurements to the fair values of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  
   19 

Summary of the fair values of other financial instruments 
  Cash equivalents 
  The estimated fair values of cash equivalents approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of such financial instruments. 
  Borrowings 
  We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt (Level 2) by taking into consideration indicative prices obtained from a third-party financial institution that utilizes industry standard valuation models, including both income- and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities; credit spreads; benchmark yields; foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable; and other observable inputs. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate fair values of our long-term debt were   $39.2 billion   and   $33.1 billion  , respectively, and the carrying values were   $35.3 billion   and   $31.4 billion  , respectively. 
   
  12. Derivative instruments 
  The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks related to its business operations. To reduce our risks related to these exposures, we utilize or have utilized certain derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward, foreign currency option, cross-currency swap, forward interest rate and interest rate swap contracts. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. 
  Cash flow hedges 
  We are exposed to possible changes in the values of certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated primarily with our euro-denominated international product sales. Increases and decreases in the cash flows associated with our international product sales due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by corresponding increases and decreases in the cash flows from our international operating expenses resulting from these foreign currency exchange rate movements. To further reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international product sales, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected international product sales,   primarily over a three-year time horizon  , with, at any given point in time, a higher percentage of nearer-term projected product sales being hedged than in successive periods. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of   $3.5 billion   and   $3.3 billion  , respectively, and open foreign currency option contracts with notional amounts of   $178 million   and   $225 million  , respectively. We have designated these foreign currency forward and foreign currency option contracts, which are primarily euro based, as cash flow hedges; and accordingly, we report the effective portions of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts in AOCI in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we reclassify them to earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 
  To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term debt denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts. Under the terms of these contracts, we paid euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and received U.S. dollars for the notional amounts at the inception of the contracts; and based on these notional amounts, we exchange interest payments at fixed rates over the lives of the contracts by paying U.S. dollars and receiving euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs. In addition, we will pay U.S. dollars to and receive euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs from the counterparties at the maturities of the contracts for these same notional amounts. The terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged debt, effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on the debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. We have designated these cross-currency swap contracts as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, the effective portions of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are reported in AOCI in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the hedged debt affects earnings. 
  
   20 

The notional amounts and interest rates of our cross-currency swaps are as follows (notional amounts in millions): 

In connection with anticipated issuances of long-term fixed-rate debt, we entered into forward interest rate contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The forward interest rate contracts hedged the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable Treasury rate between the time we entered into these contracts and the time the related debt was issued in August 2016. Gains and losses realized on such contracts, which were designated as cash flow hedges, were recognized in AOCI and are being amortized into earnings over the lives of the associated debt issuances. 
  The effective portions of the unrealized gain/(loss) recognized in other comprehensive income for our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were as follows (in millions): 

The locations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and the effective portions of the gain/(loss) reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings for our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were as follows (in millions): 

No portions of our cash flow hedge contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and the gains and losses of the ineffective portions of these hedging instruments were not material for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amounts expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings during the next 12 months are approximately   $39 million   of net gains on our foreign currency and cross-currency swap contracts and approximately   $2 million   of losses on forward interest rate contracts. 
  Fair value hedges 
  To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rates on our long-term debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. The terms of these interest rate swap contracts correspond to the related hedged debt instruments and effectively convert a fixed interest rate coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the lives of the respective notes. We had interest rate swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , with aggregate notional amounts of   $6.65 billion  . The contracts have rates that range from three-month LIBOR plus   0.4%   to three-month LIBOR plus   2.0%  . 
  
   21 

For derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, we recognize in current earnings the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative resulting from the change in fair value during the period as well as the offsetting unrealized loss or gain of the hedged item resulting from the change in fair value during the period attributable to the hedged risk. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we included the unrealized gains on hedged debt of   $61 million   and unrealized losses of   $137 million  , respectively, in the same line item, Interest expense, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, as the offsetting unrealized losses of   $61 million   and unrealized gains of   $137 million  , respectively, on the related interest rate swap agreements. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we included the unrealized losses on the hedged debt of   $134 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, in the same line item, Interest expense, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, as the offsetting unrealized gains of   $134 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, on the related interest rate swap agreements. 
  Derivatives not designated as hedges 
  To reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging transactions. The exposures are hedged on a month-to-month basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the total notional amounts of these foreign currency forward contracts were   $874 million   and   $911 million  , respectively. 
  The location in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and the amount of gain/(loss) recognized in earnings for our derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments were as follows (in millions):

Our derivative contracts that were in liability positions as of   September 30, 2016  , contain certain credit-risk-related contingent provisions that would be triggered if (i) we were to undergo a change in control and (ii) our or the surviving entity s creditworthiness deteriorates, which is generally defined as having either a credit rating that is below investment grade or a materially weaker creditworthiness after the change in control. If these events were to occur, the counterparties would have the right, but not the obligation, to close the contracts under early-termination provisions. In such circumstances, the counterparties could request immediate settlement of these contracts for amounts that approximate the then current fair values of the contracts. In addition, our derivative contracts are not subject to any type of master netting arrangement, and amounts due to or from a counterparty under these contracts may be offset against other amounts due to or from the same counterparty only if an event of default or termination, as defined, were to occur. 
  The cash flow effects of our derivative contracts for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are included within Net cash provided by operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
   
  13. Contingencies and commitments  
  Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.) We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could be significant in this Note; in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015; and in Note 13, Contingencies and commitments to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016. 
  We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. 
  Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with thousands of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as other matters, involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims including but not limited to patent infringement, marketing, pricing and trade practices and securities law some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories.     In each of the matters described in this filing or in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, or in Note 13, Contingencies and commitments to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, plaintiffs seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process (which in complex proceedings of the sort faced by us often extend for several years). As a result, none of the matters pending against us described in this filing, in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, or in Note 13, Contingencies and commitments to our  
  
   23 

condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material.     While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  Certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and other matters are discussed below:

These lawsuits are based on abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) that seek approval to market generic versions of KYPROLIS        before expiration of the asserted patent or patents. In each lawsuit, Onyx Therapeutics seeks an order of the Delaware District Court making any FDA approval of the defendant s ANDA effective no earlier than the expiration of all asserted patents. 
  Other Biosimilar Patent Litigations 
  We have filed a number of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products. In each case, our complaint alleges that the manufacturer s actions infringe certain patents we hold and/or that the manufacturer has failed to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). 
  Sandoz Pegfilgrastim Litigation 
  On June 23, 2016, Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), a Novartis company, responded to Amgen s patent infringement complaint denying infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are not infringed and invalid. 
  
   24

  On August 11, 2016, and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the New Jersey District Court) entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Sandoz from making, using, importing, selling or offering for sale Sandoz s etanercept product. A claim construction hearing is set for February 15, 2017, and trial is scheduled to start on April 17, 2018. On August 30, 2016, the FDA approved Sandoz s Erelzi        (etanercept-szzs), a biosimilar to Enbrel        (etanercept). 
  Apotex Pegfilgrastim/Filgrastim Litigation 
  On September 9, 2016, Apotex petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari, seeking review of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit Court) holding that the 180-day notice of commercial marketing is mandatory under the BPCIA and can only be given post-FDA licensure of the biosimilar product. 
  On September 16, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered final judgment that Apotex s process of manufacturing its filgrastim and pegfilgrastim products do not infringe our U.S. Patent No. 8,952,138, dismissing without prejudice Apotex s remaining invalidity counterclaim for patent invalidity, and making permanent the injunction compelling Apotex to provide 180-day advance notice of first commercial marketing of its filgrastim and pegfilgrastim products if and when the FDA approves these products. On October 3, 2016, Amgen filed an appeal of the final judgment to the Federal Circuit Court.  
  Hospira Epoetin Alfa Litigation 
  On August 5, 2016, the Delaware District Court denied the motion filed by Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc., to dismiss Amgen s complaint which seeks a declaration that Hospira failed to comply with the commercial notice requirement of the BPCIA. On August 19, 2016, Hospira responded to the complaint denying the allegations of the First Amended Complaint and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid and not infringed by Hospira. On August 15, 2016, Amgen moved to amend the First Amended Complaint to add additional bases for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 5,756,349 and to add three additional third-party defendants. On October 3, 2016, the Delaware District Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part Amgen s motion to amend, permitting Amgen to add the additional bases for infringement but not the additional parties to the existing lawsuit. A claim construction hearing was held on September 21, 2016. 
  On August 5, 2016, the Federal Circuit Court denied Hospira s motion to dismiss Amgen s appeal, which seeks review of the Delaware District Court s order that Hospira need not provide Amgen discovery of certain of its manufacturing processes which information was withheld by Hospira during the BPCIA dispute resolution process. 
  Onyx Litigation 
  The Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo scheduled a November 18, 2016, hearing for final approval of the settlement between the plaintiffs and the former Onyx directors.

For discussion of ongoing, related litigation, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
      
  Selected financial information 
  The following is an overview of our results of operations (dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data): 

Global product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were flat as strong unit volume growth in Prolia       , Repatha       , KYPROLIS       , Vectibix       , Sensipar        and XGEVA        was offset by declines in product sales of EPOGEN       , NEUPOGEN        and Neulasta       . The increase in global product sales for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by ENBREL, Prolia       , KYPROLIS       ,       Sensipar        and XGEVA       , partially offset by declines in EPOGEN       , NEUPOGEN        and Neulasta       . 
  The increase in other revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by milestone payments received for licensing transactions and higher Ibrance        (palbociclib) royalty income. We receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance        sales. 
  The decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was driven by savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Operating expenses for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , were flat, as increased investments in new product launches were offset by savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts. 
  The increases in net income and diluted EPS for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were driven by higher revenues and operating margins. 
  Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefits or detriments that such movements have on our international product sales are offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. By hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros, our hedging activities seek to offset both the positive and negative impacts that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income. The net impacts  
  
   28 

from changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not material for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Results of operations 
  Product sales 
  Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

Future sales of our products are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our products more significantly than others. Such factors are discussed below and in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  : (i) Overview, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, (ii) Item 1A. Risk Factors and (iii) Item 7. Results of Operations Product Sales; and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, in section Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  ENBREL 
  Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

ENBREL sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were flat, as an increase in the net selling price was offset by a decline in units due to competition and unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories. 
  The increase in ENBREL sales for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price, offset partially by a decline in units due to competition. 
  We expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017. 
  Neulasta       
  Total Neulasta        sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

29 

The     decreases in global Neulasta        sales for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , were driven primarily by a decline in unit demand and wholesaler inventory, offset partially by an increase in net selling price in the United States. As of September 30, 2016, utilization of the Neulasta        OnPro        kit continues to grow. 
  Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta       ) expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta       sales. Apotex, Sandoz (a Novartis company) and most recently in October 2016, Coherus BioSciences, Inc., announced that the FDA has accepted their applications for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta       . Subsequently, Novartis has indicated that it received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA and expects to submit data from an additional study in 2018. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex and Sandoz, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta       ) will expire in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , Part I, Item 1. Business. 
  Future Neulasta        sales will also depend in part on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. 
  Aranesp       
  Total Aranesp        sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

The increase in global Aranesp        sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by higher unit demand due to a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers from EPOGEN        to Aranesp       . 
  The increase in global Aranesp        sales for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by higher unit demand due to a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers from EPOGEN        to Aranesp       , offset partially by a decrease in net selling price. 
  Supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp       ) expired in June 2016. For further information regarding our patents, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , Part I, Item 1. Business. 
  Prolia       
  Total Prolia        sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

The increases in global Prolia        sales for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were driven primarily by higher unit demand. 
  
   30 

Sensipar       /Mimpara       
  Total Sensipar       /Mimpara        sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

The increase in global Sensipar       /Mimpara        sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price and higher unit demand. 
  The increase in global Sensipar       /Mimpara        sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price and higher unit demand, offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories. 
  XGEVA        
  Total XGEVA        sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

The increases in global XGEVA        sales for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were driven primarily by higher unit demand and net selling price. 
  EPOGEN       
  Total EPOGEN        sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

The decrease in EPOGEN        sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was driven primarily by a decline in units, resulting from competition, abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in the prior year and a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers to Aranesp.  
  The decrease in EPOGEN        sales       for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was driven primarily by a decline in units resulting from competition and a shift by some U.S. dialysis customers to Aranesp       . 
  Sequentially, EPOGEN        sales were relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2016, as the unit decline moderated and was offset by a favorable change in wholesaler inventory. 
  Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN        expired in May 2015. There is competition in the United States, which has had a material adverse impact on EPOGEN        sales. Further, o  n December 16, 2014, Hospira submitted a BLA to the FDA under the abbreviated pathway for Retacrit       , a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN       . For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Hospira, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  
   31 

NEUPOGEN       
  NEUPOGEN        sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

The decreases in global NEUPOGEN        sales for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were driven primarily by lower unit demand in the United States and a decrease in net selling price due to the impact of short-acting competition. 
  There is competition in the United States, which has intensified and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of NEUPOGEN       . On September 3, 2015, Sandoz announced it had launched Zarxio       , a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN       , in the United States. On February 17, 2015, Apotex announced that the FDA had accepted its application for filing under the abbreviated pathway for its proposed biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN       . For discussion of ongoing, related litigation, see Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Transformation and process improvements 
  We continue to execute on the transformation and process improvement efforts announced in 2014. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The efforts include a restructuring, which also is delivering cost savings and is funding investments. 
  We continue to estimate that the restructuring will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million, of which $698 million was incurred through   September 30, 2016  . The charges that were recorded related to the restructuring during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were not significant. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs through 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. 
  In 2016, we remain on track to meet or exceed an estimated $400 million in incremental benefits, versus 2015, from our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts with over three quarters of this savings achieved through September 30, 2016. These savings will enable continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities. 
  Cost of sales 
  Cost of sales decreased to 17.7% and 18.2% of total revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The decreases were driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling prices, offset partially by product mix. 
  Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.1% and 16.5% of total revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with 16.4% and 17.8% for the corresponding periods of the prior year. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. 
  Research and development 
  The decreases in R D expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , were driven by savings resulting from transformation and process improvement efforts, as well as by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. The decreases were offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the Company, including increases in up-front payments for several in-licensing transactions. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , costs associated with our later-stage clinical programs support decreased by $200 million and $765 million, respectively, offset by increased costs in marketed products support of $51 million and $538 million, respectively. Discovery Research and Translational Sciences spend was relatively unchanged for both periods. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs. 
  
   33 

Selling, general and administrative 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , were flat. The increase in SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was driven primarily by investments in new product launches     and a $73 million charge related to an acquisition. Both periods benefited from transformation and process improvement efforts.  
  Other 
  Other operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, included the impairment of a non-key contract asset acquired in a prior year business combination. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , also included legal proceeding charges of $105 million. 
  Other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , included a $32 million gain for the sale of assets related to our site closures and a decrease in the estimated aggregate fair value of a contingent consideration obligation of $18 million, offset partially by a $28 million charge associated with the write-off of a non-key contract asset acquired in a prior year business combination. The nine months ended September 30, 2015, also included certain charges related to our restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, primarily severance of $73 million and a legal proceeding charge of $71 million. 
   
  Non-operating expenses/income and income taxes 
  Non-operating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 

Interest expense, net 
  The   increases   in Interest expense, net, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , were due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed-rate debt outstanding. 
  Interest and other income, net 
  The increases in Interest and other income, net, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , were due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average cash balances and net gains on sales of interest-bearing securities, offset partially by higher gains on sales of strategic equity investments in the prior year.  
   
  Income taxes  
  The increase in our effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. 
  The increase in our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and a state tax audit settlement in the prior year. The increase was offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments and discrete benefits associated with tax incentives.  
  Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, would have been   19.4%   and   18.8%  , respectively, compared with   18.4%   and   18.7%   for the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
  See Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources 
  Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): 

We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, in which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.  
  In December 2015, March 2016 and July 2016, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.00 per share of common stock, which were paid on March 8, June 8 and September 8, 2016, respectively. In October 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, which will be paid on December 8, 2016. 
  We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had stock repurchases of   $2.0 billion   and   $1.7 billion  , respectively. As of September 30, 2016,   $2.9 billion   remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase that resulted in a total of $5.0 billion available under the stock repurchase program. 
  We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. 
  Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaling   $38.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , approximately $34.4 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. 
  Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   35 

Cash flows 
  Our cash flow activities were as follows (in millions): 

Operating 
  Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , decreased compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to the timing of payments to taxing authorities, accelerated inventory production costs and the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015, offset partially by increased net income. 
  Investing 
  Cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of   $6.7 billion   and capital expenditures of   $511 million  . Cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was due primarily to net activity related to marketable securities of   $4.8 billion   and capital expenditures of   $389 million  , offset partially by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of   $271 million  . Capital expenditures during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in various locations as well as other site developments. We currently estimate 2016 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. 
  Financing 
  Cash used in financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to the payment of dividends of   $2.3 billion  , repurchases of our common stock of   $2.0 billion   and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of   $254 million  , offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of   $4.0 billion  . Cash used in financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was due primarily to the payment of dividends of   $1.8 billion  , repurchases of our common stock of   $1.7 billion  , withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of   $394 million   and the settlement of an obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of Onyx of   $225 million  , offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments, of   $1.2 billion  . 
  See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders  equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
   
  Critical accounting policies 
  The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
                 Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Information about our market risk is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and is incorporated herein by reference. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , to the information provided in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the entire principal amount of the debt denominated in euros and Swiss francs that we issued during this period. As of September 30, 2016, we had open cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that effectively convert interest payments and principal  
  
   36 

repayment of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt securities to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2016, would result in a reduction in the aggregate fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $500 million, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year. 
  Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a carrying value of $5.8 billion and a fair value of $6.5 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of September 30, 2016, would result in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $1.3 billion and a reduction in income of approximately $1.2 billion but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. 
  With regard to our $5.6 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to exchange rates as of September 30, 2016, would result in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $1.3 billion but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income during this period from the above mentioned hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. 
   
                 Item 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and, in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Management determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

See Note 13, Contingencies and commitments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended   September 30, 2016  , June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, for discussions that are limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings. Those discussions should be read in conjunction with Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
                 Item 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. We have described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the primary risks related to our business, and we periodically update those risks for material developments. Those risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions,  
  
   37 

geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. 
  Below, we are providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in   Part II, Item 1A. our Quarterly Reports, on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016  , provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference. 
  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.  
  Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and greater focus on pricing and price increases may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based upon their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. 
  A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from the U.S. federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal government. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1. Business Reimbursement.) Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. For example, discussions continue about proposals that would allow the U.S. federal government to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers or require manufacturers to pay higher rebates in the Medicare Part D setting. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of regulations or demonstration projects implemented by the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. State government actions can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our products are priced. For example, a recently enacted Vermont law allows state healthcare regulators to identify certain drugs on which the state spends significant health care dollars and for which list prices rose by a certain percentage (which this year includes ENBREL) and to require the manufacturers to submit justifications of the price increases to the state attorney general. Many other states have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing legislation, including state proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, California voters will consider in the November 2016 election a ballot proposition that would prohibit the state from paying a greater price for drugs than the lowest price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Passage of this California proposition could lead to the introduction of similar ballot initiatives in other states. Legislative or regulatory changes or other government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer commercial patient co-pay payment assistance or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  
  Payers, including healthcare insurers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and others, increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers. Payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, and some payers may attempt to limit the use of commercial patient co-pay payment assistance programs. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products, such as requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, since the launch of Repatha        in August 2015, the application of utilization management criteria by some payers, including PBMs, has resulted in denials of coverage for a substantial number of patients for whom Repatha        has been prescribed, slowing Repatha        sales. In the current competitive environment, even if the phase 3 ongoing outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha        to prevent cardiovascular events meets its clinical endpoints, the application of restrictive utilization management criteria by some payers may continue until the clinical data is reflected in approved product labeling, or even thereafter. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products. 
  We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to U.S. government healthcare programs. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a monthly and quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated  
  
   38 

previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. 
  Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1. Business Reimbursement.) For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product s price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. 
  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. 
  Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. 
  Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions which could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products  or product candidates  relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical  
  
   39 

trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. 
  Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate the clinical trial program and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval. 
  Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011   erythropoiesis-stimulating agents     (ESA) label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations.
