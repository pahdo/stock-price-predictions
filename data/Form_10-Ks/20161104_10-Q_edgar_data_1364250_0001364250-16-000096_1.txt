  Forward Looking Statements 

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.  You can find many (but not all) of these statements by looking for words such as "approximates," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "would," "could", "may", "future" or other similar expressions in this Report.  We claim the protection of the safe harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Report, or those that we may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on our beliefs and assumptions, as well as information currently available to us.  The actual outcome will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict.  Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect.  As a result, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences may be material.  Accordingly, investors should use caution when relying on previously reported forward-looking statements, which were based on results and trends at the time they were made, to anticipate future results or trends. 
    
  Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include the following:  

adverse economic or real estate developments in Southern California and Honolulu, Hawaii;  
                
    a general downturn in the economy, such as the global financial crisis that commenced in 2008; 
                
    decreased rental rates or increased tenant incentive and vacancy rates;  
                
    defaults on, early termination of, or non-renewal of leases by tenants;  
                
    increased interest rates and operating costs;  
                
    failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness;  
                
    difficulties in raising capital for our unconsolidated Funds;  
                
    difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;  
                
    failure to successfully operate acquired properties;  
                
    failure to maintain our status as a REIT under federal tax laws;  
                
    possible adverse changes in rent control laws and regulations;  
                
    environmental uncertainties; 
                
    risks related to natural disasters;  
                
    lack or insufficient amount of insurance, or changes to the cost of maintaining existing insurance coverage;  
                
    inability to successfully expand into new markets and submarkets;  
                
    risks associated with property development;  
                
    conflicts of interest with our officers;  
                
    changes in real estate zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates;  
                
    the negative results of litigation or governmental proceedings; 
                
    the consequences of any possible future terrorist attacks or wars; and  
                
    the consequences of any possible future cyber attacks or intrusions. 
       
  For further discussion of the above risk factors, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  This Report and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.  We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report.

1. Overview 
    
  Organization and Business Description 
    
  Douglas Emmett, Inc. is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT.  We are one of the largest owners and operators of high-quality office and multifamily properties in Los Angeles County, California and Honolulu, Hawaii.  We focus on owning, acquiring, developing and managing a substantial share of top-tier office properties and premier multifamily communities in neighborhoods that possess significant supply constraints, high-end executive housing and key lifestyle amenities.   
    
  Through our interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, our consolidated joint ventures and our unconsolidated Funds, we own or partially own, acquire, develop and manage real estate, consisting primarily of office and multifamily properties in Los Angeles, California and Honolulu, Hawaii.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a consolidated portfolio of (i)   fifty-nine   office properties (including ancillary retail space), which included   seven   office properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures, (ii)   ten   multifamily properties and (iii) fee interests in   two   parcels of land subject to ground leases from which we earn ground rent income.  Alongside our consolidated portfolio, we also manage and own equity interests in our unconsolidated Funds, which at   September 30, 2016  , owned   eight   additional office properties, for a combined   sixty-seven   office properties in our total portfolio.  
    
  The terms "us," "we" and "our" as used in these financial statements refer to Douglas Emmett, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Douglas Emmett, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including our Operating Partnership and our consolidated joint ventures.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated financial statements included   two   consolidated joint ventures which were determined to be VIEs and we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  The VIEs were established in 2016 in connection with the acquisition of properties by the respective joint ventures.  See Note   3   for information regarding the properties that were acquired by these joint ventures in 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the impact of consolidating the VIEs increased our total assets, liabilities and equity by   $1.81 billion   (of which   $1.73 billion   related to investment in real estate),   $790.7 million   and   $1.02 billion   (of which   $738.8 million   related to noncontrolling interests), respectively.  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we sold a property which was classified as real estate held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets.  The carrying value in the comparable period has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  See Note   3   for information regarding the property that we sold. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP may have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make their presentation not misleading.  The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements include, in our opinion, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial information set forth therein.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes thereto.  Any references in this report to the number of properties, square footage, per square footage amounts, apartment units and geography, are outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s review of our financial statements, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  During the period covered by this Report, we have not made any material changes to our significant accounting policies included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code.  Provided that we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate-level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders that we derive from our REIT qualifying activities.  We are subject to corporate-level tax on the earnings that we derive through our TRS. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  Changes to GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of ASUs.  We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. 
    
  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, "Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)", which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP.  The FASB is issuing this ASU as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).  The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, which for us is the first quarter of 2016. We adopted the ASU in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Consolidation - Topic 810)", which provides guidance regarding the consolidation of certain legal entities.  All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, which for us is the first quarter of 2016.  We adopted the ASU in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments", which amends "Business Combinations" (Topic 805).  The ASU requires that an acquirer (i) recognize adjustments to provisional amounts from business combinations that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, (ii) record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and (iii) disclosure of the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015, which for us is the first quarter of 2016.  We adopted the ASU in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. 
    
   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05, "Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships", which amends "Derivatives and Hedging" (Topic 815).  The ASU provides guidance on the effect of derivative contract novations on existing hedge accounting relationships.  The ASU clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, does not in and of itself require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2017, and early adoption is permitted.  We adopted the ASU in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842).  The ASU increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  To meet that objective, the FASB has created Topic 842.  The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP.  For example, the vast majority of operating leases will remain classified as operating leases, and lessors will continue to recognize lease income for those leases on a generally straight-line basis over the lease term.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2019, and early adoption is permitted.  In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, "Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)" which amends "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606).  The ASU clarifies the guidance for principal versus agent considerations.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption is permitted commencing the first quarter of 2017.  The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, "Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" which amends "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606).  The ASU provides guidance for identifying performance obligations and licensing.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption is permitted commencing the first quarter of 2017.  The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, "Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients" which amends "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606).  The ASU provides guidance for a variety of revenue recognition related topics.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption is permitted commencing the first quarter of 2017.  The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which amends "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses" (Topic 326).  The ASU provides guidance for measuring credit losses on financial instruments.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted commencing the first quarter of 2019.  The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" which amends "Statement of Cash Flows" (Topic 230).  The ASU provides guidance regarding the presentation of certain types of transactions in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, which for us would be the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption is permitted.  The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively.  We do not expect the ASU to have a material impact on our statement of cash flows. 
    
  The FASB has not issued any other ASUs during   2016   that we expect to be applicable and have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

  On   February 29, 2016   (Acquisition Date), a consolidated joint venture which we manage and in which we own an equity interest acquired   four   Class A multi-tenant office properties located in Westwood, California (Westwood Portfolio) for a contract price of   $1.34 billion  .  As of the Acquisition Date, we had contributed   sixty  -percent of the equity to the joint venture, which was subsequently reduced to   thirty  -percent on May 31, 2016 (Sell Down Date) when we sold half of our ownership interest to a third party investor.  The results of operations for the acquisition are included in our consolidated statements of operations after the Acquisition Date.  The table below (in thousands) summarizes our preliminary purchase accounting and funding sources for the acquisition (the purchase accounting is subject to adjustment within twelve months of the acquisition date):   

________________________________________________     
           (1) 
    Reflects the purchase of the Westwood Portfolio on the Acquisition Date when we contributed   sixty  -percent of the equity to the consolidated joint venture. 
              (2) 
    Reflects our sale of   thirty  -percent of the equity in the joint venture on the Sell Down Date, presented as of the Acquisition Date, treated as in-substance real estate, which reduced our ownership interest in the joint venture to   thirty  -percent.  We sold the interest for the   $240.0 million   we contributed plus an additional   $1.1 million   to compensate us for our costs of holding the investment.  We recognized a gain on the sale of   $1.1 million  , which is included in Gains on sales of investments in real estate in our consolidated statement of operations.  We used the proceeds from the sale to pay down the balance owed on our revolving credit facility. 
              (3) 
    As of the Acquisition Date, the weighted average remaining life of the acquired above-and below-market leases was approximately   4.4 years  .

The loan has a   seven  -year term and is secured by the Westwood Portfolio.  Interest on the loan is floating at LIBOR plus   1.40%  , which has been effectively fixed at   2.37%   per annum for   five   years through interest rate swaps.  The deferred loan costs will be amortized over the   seven  -year loan term.  Deferred loan costs are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of our secured notes payable and revolving credit facility.

5. Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Funds 
    
  Description of our Funds 
    
  We manage and own equity interests in   two   unconsolidated Funds, Fund X and Partnership X, through which we and investors own   eight   office properties totaling   1.8 million   square feet.  At   September 30, 2016  , we held equity interests of   68.61%   of Fund X and   24.25%   of Partnership X.

We also receive distributions based on invested capital and on any profits that exceed certain specified cash returns to the investors.  The table below presents (in thousands) cash distributions received from our Funds: 

Notes receivable 
    
  In   April 2013  , we loaned   $2.9 million   to a related party investor in connection with a capital call made by Fund X, and  in   November 2015  , we loaned   $0.5 million   to Partnership X to fund working capital.  Both loans carried interest at   LIBOR plus 2.5%   per annum and were repaid in full during the first quarter of 2016.  The outstanding balance of the Fund X and Partnership X loans at   December 31, 2015   of   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, were included in our investment in our unconsolidated funds in our consolidated balance sheet.

9. Derivative Contracts 
    
  Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We make use of interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on our floating-rate debt.  When we enter into a floating-rate term loan, we generally enter into an interest rate swap agreement for the equivalent principal amount, for a period covering the majority of the loan term, which effectively converts our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis during that time.  In limited instances, we make use of interest rate caps to limit our exposure to interest rate increases on our floating-rate debt.  We do not speculate in derivatives and we do not make use of any other derivative instruments.  See Note   7   for the details of our floating-rate debt that we have hedged. 
    
  Accounting for Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  When we enter into derivative agreements, we generally elect to have them designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.  For hedging instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), which is a component of equity outside of earnings, and any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded as interest expense.  Amounts recorded in AOCI related to our designated hedges are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the hedged floating-rate debt.  Amounts reported in AOCI related to our unconsolidated Funds' hedges are reclassified to income, including depreciation, from unconsolidated real estate funds, as interest payments are made by our  Funds on their hedged floating-rate debt.  For hedging instruments which are not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recorded as interest expense.  We present our derivatives, including the derivatives of our consolidated joint ventures, on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value on a gross basis.  Our share of the AOCI related to our unconsolidated Funds' derivatives is included in our investment in unconsolidated real estate funds on our consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Summary of our Derivatives 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our interest rate swaps, including our unconsolidated Funds' interest rate swaps, were designated as cash flow hedges:

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
    
  We have agreements with each of our interest rate swap counterparties that contain a provision under which we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations if we default on the underlying indebtedness that we are hedging.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no events of default with respect to our interest rate swaps or our unconsolidated Funds' interest rate swaps.  The fair value of our interest rate swaps in a liability position were as follows (in thousands):

    The notional amount presented represents   100%  , not our pro-rata share, of the amounts related to our unconsolidated Funds.   See Note   5   for more information regarding our unconsolidated Funds. 
       
  Counterparty Credit Risk 
    
  We are also subject to credit risk from the counterparties on our interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into agreements with a variety of high quality counterparties with investment grade ratings.   The fair value of our interest rate swaps in an asset position were as follows (in thousands):

Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Our noncontrolling interests consist of interests in our Operating Partnership and consolidated joint ventures which are not owned by us.  Noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership consist of OP Units and fully-vested LTIP Units, and represented approximately   14%   of our Operating Partnership's total interests as of   September 30, 2016   when we and our Operating Partnership had   151.1 million   shares of common stock and   25.3 million   OP Units and fully-vested LTIP Units outstanding.  A share of our common stock, an OP Unit and an LTIP Unit (once vested and booked up) have essentially the same economic characteristics, sharing equally in the distributions from our Operating Partnership.  Investors who own OP Units have the right to cause our Operating Partnership to redeem their OP Units for an amount of cash per unit equal to the market value of one share of our common stock at the date of redemption, or, at our election, exchange their OP Units for shares of our common stock on a     one-for-one b  asis.  LTIP Units have been granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of their compensation.  These awards generally vest over a service period and once vested can generally be converted to OP Units.

  Equity Compensation 
    
  On June 2, 2016, the Douglas Emmett, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan became effective after receiving stockholder approval, superseding our prior plan, the Douglas Emmett, Inc. 2006 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan.   The key terms of the two plans are substantially identical, except for the date of expiration, the number of shares authorized for grants and various technical provisions.  Our officers, employees, directors and consultants are eligible to participate in both plans, with grants awarded during June 2016 and onwards awarded under the 2016 Plan, and grants awarded prior to that date awarded under the 2006 Plan and remain outstanding according to their terms.  Both plans are administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors.  Total net stock-based compensation expense was   $2.3 million   and   $2.0 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7.1 million   and   $6.0 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These amounts are net of capitalized stock-based compensation of   $235 thousand   and   $208 thousand   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $683 thousand   and   $610 thousand   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised was   $2.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , and   $104.0 million   and   $2.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

11. EPS 
    
  We calculate basic EPS by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  We calculate diluted EPS by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive instruments outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  We account for unvested LTIP awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends as participating securities and include these securities in the computation of basic and diluted EPS using the two-class method.  The table below presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS: 

____________________________________________________ 
           (1)  
    The following securities were excluded from the computation of the weighted average diluted shares because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive to the calculation of diluted EPS:

12. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Our estimates of the fair value of financial instruments were determined using available market information and widely used valuation methods.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and determine an estimated fair value.  The use of different market assumptions or valuation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair values.  The FASB fair value framework hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity, and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market-based inputs.  The hierarchy is as follows:  
    
  Level 1 -  inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   
  Level 2 -  inputs are observable either directly or indirectly for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.   
  Level 3 -  inputs are unobservable assumptions generated by the reporting entity  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any fair value measurements of financial instruments using Level 3 inputs. 
    
  Financial instruments disclosed at fair value 
    
  Short term financial instruments:      The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, tenant receivables, revolving credit line, interest payable, accounts payable, security deposits and dividends payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
    
  Secured notes payable:      See Note   7   for the details of our secured notes payable.  We estimate the fair value of our secured notes payable, which includes the secured notes payable of our consolidated joint ventures, by calculating the credit-adjusted present value of the principal and interest payments for each secured note payable.  The calculation incorporates observable market interest rates which we consider to be Level 2 inputs, assumes that the loans will be outstanding through maturity, and excludes any maturity extension options.  The table below presents (in thousands) the estimated fair value of our secured notes payable: 

Financial instruments measured at fair value 
    
  Derivative instruments:      See Note   9   for the details of our derivatives.  We present our derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, on a gross basis, excluding accrued interest.  We estimate the fair value of our derivative instruments by calculating the credit-adjusted present value of the expected future cash flows of each derivative.  The calculation incorporates the contractual terms of the derivatives, observable market interest rates which we consider to be Level 2 inputs, and credit risk adjustments to reflect the counterparty's as well as our own nonperformance risk.  Our derivatives are not subject to master netting arrangements.  The table below presents (in thousands) the estimated fair value of our derivatives: 

____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Our derivatives are included in interest rate contracts in our consolidated balance sheet.  The fair value excludes accrued interest (which is included in interest payable in the consolidated balance sheet). 
              (2) 
    Represents   100%  , not our pro-rata share, of the amounts related to our unconsolidated Funds.  Our pro-rata share of the amounts related to the unconsolidated Funds' derivatives is included in our Investment in unconsolidated real estate funds in our consolidated balance sheet.    See Note   5   for more information regarding our unconsolidated Funds.

13. Segment Reporting 
    
  Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews information for operational decision-making purposes.  We operate in   two   business segments: (i) the acquisition, development, ownership and management of office real estate and (ii) the acquisition, development, ownership and management of multifamily real estate.  The services for our office segment primarily include rental of office space and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental.  The services for our multifamily segment include rental of apartments and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental.  Asset information by segment is not reported because we do not use this measure to assess performance or make decisions to allocate resources.  Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments.  General and administrative expenses and interest expense are not included in segment profit as our internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level.  Segment profit is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP, it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  Not all companies may calculate segment profit in the same manner.  We consider segment profit to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it can assist both investors and management in understanding the core operations of our properties.  The table below presents (in thousands) the operating activity of our reportable segments: 

The table below (in thousands) is a reconciliation of the total profit from all segments to net income attributable to common stockholders:

14. Future Minimum Lease Rental Receipts 
    
  We lease space to tenants primarily under non-cancelable operating leases that generally contain provisions for a base rent plus reimbursement for certain operating expenses, and we own fee interests in two parcels of land subject to ground leases from which we earn ground rent income.  The table below presents (in thousands) the future minimum base rentals on our non-cancelable office tenant and ground operating leases at   September 30, 2016  : 

_____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Does not include (i) residential leases, which typically have a term of one year or less, (ii) tenant reimbursements, (iii) straight line rent, (iv) amortization/accretion of acquired above/below-market lease intangibles and (v) percentage rents.  The amounts assume that early termination options held by tenants are not exercised. 

15. Future Minimum Lease Rental Payments 
    
  We incurred ground lease payments of   $183 thousand   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $550 thousand   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The table below presents (in thousands) the future minimum ground lease payments as of   September 30, 2016  :

16. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.  Excluding ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Concentration of Risk 
    
  We are subject to credit risk with respect to our tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables related to our tenant leases.  Our tenants' ability to honor the terms of their respective leases remains dependent upon the economic, regulatory and social factors.  We seek to minimize our credit risk from our tenant leases by (i) targeting smaller, more affluent tenants, from a  diverse mix of industries, (ii) performing credit evaluations of prospective tenants and (iii) obtaining security deposits from our tenants.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.   
    
  All of our properties (including the properties owned by our unconsolidated Funds) are located in Los Angeles County, California and Honolulu, Hawaii, and we are dependent on the Southern California and Honolulu economies.  Therefore, we are susceptible to adverse local conditions and regulations, as well as natural disasters in those areas. 
    
  We are also subject to credit risk from the counterparties on our interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts that we use to manage the risk associated with our floating rate debt.  See Note   9   for the details of our interest rate contracts.  We seek to 
  minimize our credit risk by entering into agreements with a variety of high quality counterparties with investment grade ratings. 
    
  We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at high quality financial institutions with investment grade ratings.  Interest bearing accounts at each U.S. banking institution are insured by the FDIC up to   $250 thousand  .  
    
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  Conditional asset retirement obligations represent a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.  A liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation must be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.  Environmental site assessments and investigations have identified   twenty-five   buildings in our consolidated portfolio and   four   buildings owned by our unconsolidated Funds which contain asbestos, and would have to be removed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations if these properties undergo major renovations or are demolished.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the obligations to remove the asbestos from these properties have indeterminable settlement dates, and we are unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of the associated conditional asset retirement obligation. 
    
  Development Contracts 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we commenced building an additional   475   apartments (net of existing apartments to be removed) at our Moanalua Hillside Apartments in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The   $120 million   estimated cost of the new apartments does not include the cost of the land which we already owned before beginning the project.  We also plan to invest additional capital to upgrade the existing apartments, improve the parking and landscaping, build a new leasing and management office, and construct a new recreation and fitness facility with a new pool.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a remaining commitment for contracts related to the development of   $109.5 million  . 
    
  Other Contracts 
    
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a remaining commitment for capital expenditure projects and repositionings of approximately   $3.0 million  .

Guarantees 
    
  We made certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non-recourse carve- outs for loans related to both of our unconsolidated Funds.  We have also guaranteed the related swaps.  The entities have agreed to indemnify us for any amounts that we would be required to pay under these agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all obligations under these loans and swap agreements have been performed in accordance with the terms of those agreements.  The table below summarizes the debt of our Funds as of   September 30, 2016  , the amounts represent 100% (not our pro-rata share) of amounts related to our Funds:

Executive Summary 
    
  Business Description and Portfolio Summary 
    
  Douglas Emmett, Inc. is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT.  We are one of the largest owners and operators of high-quality office and multifamily properties in Los Angeles County, California and in Honolulu, Hawaii.  We focus on owning, acquiring, developing and managing a substantial share of top-tier office properties and premier multifamily communities in neighborhoods that possess significant supply constraints, high-end executive housing and key lifestyle amenities. As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio consisted of the following: 

__________________________________________________ 
           (1)  
    Our consolidated portfolio includes all of the properties included in our consolidated results.  We own 100% of these properties except for   seven   office properties totaling approximately   2.3 million   square feet, which we own through   three   consolidated joint ventures.  Our consolidated portfolio also included   two   parcels of land which are ground leased to the owners of a Class A office building and a hotel and from which we earn ground rent income.  
              (2) 
    Our total portfolio includes our consolidated portfolio plus   eight   properties totaling approximately   1.8 million   square feet owned by our unconsolidated Funds, in which we own a weighted average of approximately   60%   based on square footage.  See Note   5   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our unconsolidated Funds.

  Acquisitions and Dispositions  

During the first quarter of 2016, a consolidated joint venture which we manage and in which we own a   thirty  -percent equity interest acquired four Class A multi-tenant office properties located in Westwood, California (Westwood Portfolio) for a contract price of   $1.34 billion  .  
                
    During the third quarter of 2016, a consolidated joint venture which we manage and in which we own a   twenty  -percent equity interest acquired two Class A multi-tenant office properties located in Brentwood, California (12100 Wilshire) and Santa Monica, California (233 Wilshire) for a contract price of   $225.0 million   and   $139.5 million  , respectively.  
                
    During the third quarter of 2016, we sold a   168,000   square foot Class A office property located in Sherman Oaks, California with a carrying value of   $42.8 million   for a contract price of   $56.7 million  , and we incurred transaction costs of   $1.2 million   resulting in a net gain of   $12.7 million  .  
          
  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in   Item 1   of this Report for more detail regarding our acquisitions and dispositions. 
    
  Financings   

As part of the acquisition of the Westwood Portfolio during the first quarter of 2016, one of our consolidated joint ventures closed a seven year, non-recourse   $580.0 million   interest-only term loan.  The loan bears interest at   LIBOR + 1.40%  , and has been effectively fixed at   2.37%   per annum until   March 2021   through an interest rate swap.  The loan is secured by the Westwood Portfolio.   
                
    During the first quarter of 2016, one of our unconsolidated Funds closed a seven year, non-recourse   $110.0 million   interest-only term loan.  The loan bears interest at   LIBOR + 1.40%  , and has been effectively fixed at   2.30%   per annum until   March 2021   though an interest rate swap.  The loan is secured by two office properties owned by that Fund. 
                
    During the second quarter of 2016, we closed a seven year, non-recourse,   $360.0 million   interest-only loan, which bears interest at   LIBOR + 1.55%  , and has been effectively fixed at   2.57%   for five years.  We used the proceeds to pay off a   $256.1 million   loan that was scheduled to mature in   April 2018  .  The loan is secured by five office properties. 
                
    During the second quarter of 2016, we sold a   thirty  -percent ownership interest in the consolidated joint venture that acquired the Westwood Portfolio to a third party investor for   $241.1 million  , which reduced our ownership interest in the joint venture from   sixty  -percent to   thirty  -percent. 
                
    As part of the acquisition of office properties in Brentwood and Santa Monica, California during the third quarter of 2016, one of our consolidated joint ventures borrowed a total of   $146.0 million   under a three year, interest only, non-recourse loan bearing interest at   LIBOR + 1.55%  .  The loan is secured by those properties 
                
    During the third quarter of 2016, we sold a   thirty-five   percent ownership interest in the consolidated joint venture that acquired the office properties in Brentwood and Santa Monica, California during the third quarter to a third party investor for   $51.6 million  , which reduced our ownership interest in the joint venture from   fifty-five   percent to   twenty   percent. 
                 
    During the third quarter of 2016, we sold   1.4 million   shares of our common stock in open market transactions under our ATM program for net proceeds of approximately   $49.4 million   after commissions and other expenses.  
       
  See Notes   7   and   10   to our consolidated financial statements in   Item 1   of this Report for more detail regarding our debt and equity, respectively. 
    
  Developments 
       
  We are developing two multifamily projects, one in our Brentwood submarket in Los Angeles, California, and one in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Each development is on land which we already own:   

During the first quarter of 2016, we commenced building an additional   475   apartments (net of existing apartments to be removed) at our Moanalua Hillside Apartments in Honolulu.  The   $120 million   estimated cost of the new apartments does not include the cost of the land which we already owned before beginning the project.  We also plan to invest additional capital to upgrade the existing apartments, improve the parking and landscaping, build a new leasing and management office, and construct a new recreation and fitness facility with a new pool. 
     
   35 

     Table of Contents  

In Los Angeles, we are seeking to build a high-rise apartment building with 376 apartments.  Because development in our markets, particularly West Los Angeles, remains a long and uncertain process, we do not expect to break ground in Los Angeles before late   2017  , even if the entitlement process is successful.  We expect the cost of the development to be approximately $120 million to $140 million, which does not include the cost of the land or the existing underground parking garage, both of which we owned before beginning the project. 
       
  Repositionings    
    
         We often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near-term lease roll-over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to reposition the property for the optimal use and tenant mix.  The work we undertake to reposition a building typically takes months or even years, and could involve a range of improvements from a complete structural renovation to a targeted remodeling of selected spaces.  We generally select a property for repositioning at the time we purchase it, although repositioning efforts can also occur at properties that we already own.  During the repositioning, the affected property may display depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels which impacts our results and, therefore, comparisons of our performance from period to period.   
    
  In addition to our Moanalua Hillside Apartments in Honolulu, described above under "Developments", as of   September 30, 2016  , we are repositioning two properties: (i) a 661,000 square foot office property in Woodland Hills, California, which included a 35,000 square foot gym, and (ii) a   79,000   square foot office property in Honolulu, Hawaii, owned by a consolidated joint venture in which we own a two-thirds interest.  

Historical Results of Operations 

Portfolio Overview 
    
  Our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of the rental operations of   fifty-three   consolidated office properties and   ten   consolidated multifamily properties, as well as (after the respective date of acquisition):   four   additional office properties that one of our consolidated joint ventures acquired on   February 29, 2016  ,   two   additional office properties that another of our consolidated joint ventures acquired on   July 21, 2016   and   September 27, 2016  , and the rental operations of   one   property (before the date of sale) that we sold on September 16, 2016. 
    
  Our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   consisted of the rental operations of    fifty-three   consolidated office properties and   ten   consolidated multifamily properties, as well as (after the respective date of acquisition)   one   additional office property that we acquired on   March 5, 2015  .   
    
  Our share of the earnings from our unconsolidated Funds, which owned an additional   eight   office properties during the   nine   months ended   September 2016   and   2015  , is included in income, including depreciation, from unconsolidated real estate funds in our consolidated statements of operations.   
    
  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more detail regarding our acquisitions and dispositions, and see Note   5   for more detail regarding our unconsolidated Funds.

Rental Rate Trends - Total Portfolio 
    
  Office Rental Rates     
    
  The table below presents the average effective annual rental rate per leased square foot and the annualized lease transaction costs per leased square foot for leases executed in our total office portfolio during each period: 

___________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Because straight-line rent takes into account the full economic value of each lease, including accommodations and rent escalations, we believe that it may provide a better comparison than ending cash rents, which include the impact of the annual escalations over the entire term of the lease.  However, care should be taken in any comparison, as the averages are often significantly affected from period to period by factors such as the buildings, submarkets, and types of space and terms involved in the leases executed during the respective reporting period. 
              (2) 
    Reflects the weighted average straight-line annualized base rent (i.e., excludes tenant reimbursements, parking and other revenue) per leased square foot.  For our triple net leases, annualized rent is calculated by adding estimated expense reimbursements to base rent.  
              (3) 
    Reflects the weighted average leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances divided by the weighted average number of years for the leases.  
       
  Office Rent Roll Up 
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , 

Straight-line rent roll up.    The average straight-line rent of   $42.93   per square foot under new and renewal leases that we signed during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   28.0%   greater than the average straight-line rent of   $33.53   per square foot on the expiring leases for the same space.  The rent roll up reflects continuing increases in average starting rental rates and more leases containing annual rent escalations in excess of 3% per annum.  

Cash rent roll up.    The average starting cash rental rate of   $40.93   per square foot under new and renewal leases that we signed during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   26.1%   greater than the average starting cash rental rate of   $32.46   per square foot on the expiring leases for the same space, and   11.8%   greater than the average ending cash rental rate of   $36.61   per square foot on those expiring leases.  
       
  Fluctuations in submarkets, buildings and term of the expiring leases make predicting the changes in rent in any specific reporting period difficult.

Office Lease Expirations 
    
                The table below presents our expected expiring cash rents in our total office portfolio over the next four quarters:   

  ____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Reflects existing leases that are scheduled to expire, excluding leases where (i) the existing tenant has renewed the lease on or before   September 30, 2016  , (ii) a new tenant has executed a lease on or before   September 30, 2016   that will commence after   September 30, 2016  , (iii) early termination options that are exercised after   September 30, 2016  , (iv) defaults occurring after   September 30, 2016  , and (v) short term leases, such as month to month leases and other short term leases.  Short term leases are excluded because (a) they are not included in our changes in rental rate data, (b) have rental rates that may not be reflective of market conditions, and (c) can distort the data trends, particularly in the first quarter of the fiscal year. 
              (2) 
    Reflects annualized base rent before abatements (excludes tenant reimbursements, parking and other revenue) at expiration.  Annualized base rent for triple net leases is calculated by adding expense reimbursements to base rent. 
              (3) 
    Variations in these numbers from quarter to quarter primarily reflects the mix of buildings/submarkets involved as well as the varying terms and square footage of the individual leases involved.  
       
  Multifamily Rental Rates   
    
  The table below presents the average annual rental rate per leased unit for new tenants.  

_____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    2015 and 2016 include the impact of the acquisition of a property in Honolulu at the end of the 2014, so the numbers are not directly comparable with prior years.   
       
  Multifamily Rent Roll Up   
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , average rent on leases to new tenants at our residential properties were   2.5%     higher   for the same unit at the time it became vacant.

           (1) 
    Occupancy rates include the impact of property acquisitions, most of whose occupancy rates at the time of acquisition were well below that of our existing portfolio. 
              (2) 
    Average occupancy rates are calculated by averaging the occupancy rates on the first and last day of a quarter, and for periods longer than a quarter, by averaging the occupancy rates at the end of each of the quarters in the period and at the end of the quarter immediately prior to the start of the period. 

Comparison of   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   to   three months   ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  Office Rental Revenue:    Office rental revenue includes rental revenues from our office properties, percentage rent on the retail space contained within office properties and lease termination income.  Office rental revenue   increased   by   $25.3 million  , or   24.5%  , to   $128.7 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $103.4 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from properties that we acquired in 2016 of $22.8 million and an increase in rental revenues of $2.6 million from the properties that we owned throughout both periods, partially offset by a decrease in rental revenues from a property that we sold during the third quarter of $0.1 million.  The increase in rental revenue from the properties that we owned throughout both periods was primarily due to an increase in rental rates, which was partially offset by a decrease in the accretion from below-market leases of $0.8 million. 
    
  Office Tenant Recoveries:    Office tenant recoveries   increased   by   $1.8 million  , or   16.62%  , to   $12.9 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to tenant recoveries of $1.2 million from properties that we acquired and an increase in tenant recoveries of $0.7 million for the properties that we owned throughout both periods, partially offset by a decrease in tenant recoveries from a property that we sold of $0.1 million.  The increase in tenant recoveries from the properties that we owned throughout both periods was primarily due to timing in the recoveries from prior period reconciliations. 
    
  Office Parking and Other Income:    Office parking and other income   increased   by   $4.2 million  , or   19.5%  , to   $26.0 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $21.7 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to parking and other income of $3.1 million from properties that we acquired and an increase of $1.2 million in parking and other income from properties that we owned throughout both periods, partially offset by a decrease in parking and other income from a property that we sold of $0.1 million.  The increase in parking and other income from the properties that we owned throughout both periods primarily reflects increases in rates. 
    
  Multifamily Revenue:    Total multifamily revenue consists of rent, parking income and other income.  Total multifamily revenue   increased   by   $0.7 million  , or   2.8%  , to   $24.5 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $23.9 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to increases in rental rates.

The increase was due to rental expenses of $8.9 million from properties that we acquired, partially offset by a decrease in rental expenses of $1.1 million from properties that we owned throughout both periods and a decrease in rental expenses of $0.1 million from a property that we sold.  The decrease from properties that we owned throughout both periods was primarily due to a decrease in utilities expense. 
    
  Multifamily Rental Expenses  :  Multifamily rental expense    decreased   by   $0.2 million  , or   3.9%  , to   $6.0 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.2 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in utilities expense and excise taxes. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses  :  General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $1.2 million  , or   17.9%  , to   $8.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.9 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to an increase in equity compensation expense. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization  :  Depreciation and amortization expense   increased   by   $11.6 million  , or   22.2%  , to   $63.8 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $52.2 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of $11.7 million from properties that we acquired and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million from properties that we owned throughout both periods, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization from a property that we sold of $0.5 million. 
    
  Non-Operating Income and Expenses 
    
  Other Income and Other Expenses:    Other income   increased   by   $0.2 million  , or   7.8%  , to   $2.3 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , and other expenses   increased   by   $0.1 million   or   7.7%   to   $1.7 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.6 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase for other income and other expense was primarily due to an increase in revenues and the related expenses from managing our unconsolidated Funds as well as an increase in revenues and the related expenses from a gym that we own and operate in Honolulu, Hawaii.  
    
  Income, Including Depreciation, from Unconsolidated Real Estate Funds:    The income, including depreciation, from unconsolidated real estate funds represents our equity interest in the operating results, net of depreciation, of our unconsolidated Funds.  Our share of the income, including depreciation, from our unconsolidated Funds   increased   by   $1.4 million  , or   159.9%  , to   $2.3 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.9 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues and real estate tax refunds.  The increase in rental revenues  reflects an increase in rental rates.  See Note   5   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more detail regarding our unconsolidated Funds. 
    
  Interest Expense  :  Interest expense   increased   by   $3.8 million  , or   11.5%  , to   $36.5 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32.7 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due to interest expense of $4.4 million from new debt related to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $0.6 million on our remaining debt as a result of refinancing at lower interest rates during 2015 and 2016.  See Notes   7   and   9   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt and derivative contracts. 
    
  Acquisition-related Expenses:    Acquisition expenses include the costs of acquisitions that we close, as well as those that we do not close.  Acquisition expenses   increased   by   $1.0 million   to   $1.2 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.2 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase reflects the two office properties that we acquired during the third quarter.  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our completed acquisitions. 
    
  Gains on sales of investments in real estate:    During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold a   thirty-five   percent ownership interest in one of our consolidated joint ventures to a third party investor and recognized a gain of   $0.6 million  , and we sold an office property and recognized a gain of   $12.7 million  .  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more detail regarding our sales of ownership interests in our consolidated joint ventures to third party investors and property dispositions.

The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from properties that we acquired in 2015 and 2016 of $51.5 million, an increase in rental revenues of $6.8 million from the properties that we owned throughout both periods, and an increase in rental revenues from a property that we sold during the third quarter of $0.2 million.  The increase in rental revenue from the properties that we owned throughout both periods was primarily due to an increase in rental rates, which was partially offset by a decrease in the accretion from below-market leases of $2.6 million. 
    
  Office Tenant Recoveries:    Office tenant recoveries   increased   by   $1.4 million  , or   4.4%  , to   $34.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to tenant recoveries of $2.9 million from properties that we acquired, partially offset by a decrease in tenant recoveries of $1.5 million for the properties that we owned throughout both periods.  The decrease in tenant recoveries from the properties that we owned throughout both periods was primarily due to lower current period recoveries as a result of lower recoverable operating costs. 
    
  Office Parking and Other Income:    Office parking and other income   increased   by   $10.7 million  , or   16.7%  , to   $74.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $63.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The increase was primarily due to parking and other income of $7.0 million from properties that we acquired and an increase of $3.7 million in parking and other income from properties that we owned throughout both periods.  The increase in parking and other income from the properties that we owned throughout both periods primarily reflects increases in rates.

The increase was due to rental expenses of $20.1 million from properties that we acquired, partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million from properties that we owned throughout both periods. The decrease from properties that we owned throughout both periods was primarily due to a decrease in utilities expense. 
    
  Multifamily Rental Expenses  :  Multifamily rental expense    decreased   by   $0.6 million  , or   3.5%  , to   $17.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $17.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to an excise tax refund of $0.5 million. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses  :  General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $3.9 million  , or   17.8%  , to   $25.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $21.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to payroll taxes of $1.4 million related to the exercise of options as well as a $1.9 million increase in equity compensation expense. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization  :  Depreciation and amortization expense   increased   by   $28.6 million  , or   18.7%  , to   $181.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $153.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of $26.6 million from properties that we acquired and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $3.0 million from properties that we owned throughout both periods, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization from a property that we sold of $1.0 million.

The decrease in other income was primarily due to $6.6 million of accelerated accretion that we recognized related to an above market ground lease for which we acquired the underlying fee interest in the land in the first quarter of 2015.  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding the acquisition of the fee interest.

The increase was due to interest expense of $9.2 million from new debt related to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $0.9 million on our remaining debt as a result of refinancing at lower interest rates during 2015 and 2016.   See Notes   7   and   9   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt and derivative contracts.

The increase reflects six office properties that our consolidated joint ventures acquired during 2016 compared to only one office property that we acquired in 2015.  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more detail regarding our completed acquisitions.

Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: FFO 
    
  Usefulness to Investors 
    
  Many investors use FFO as one performance yardstick to compare the operating performance of REITs.  FFO represents net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, (ii) impairments of depreciable operating property, (iii) real estate depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of deferred financing costs), and (iv) the same adjustments for unconsolidated funds and consolidated joint ventures.   
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT.  Like any metric, FFO has limitations as a measure of our performance, because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations.  Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other REITs.  Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance.  FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.  FFO should not be used as a supplement to or a substitute measure for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Comparison of Results 
    
  For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , FFO   increased   by   $13.5 million  , or   19.2%  , to   $83.9 million  , compared to   $70.4 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in operating income from our office portfolio due to acquisitions and (ii) an increase in operating income from our multifamily portfolio due to higher rental rates, partially offset by increases in (a) interest expense due to new debt related to acquisitions, (b) general and administrative expenses due to an increase in equity compensation and (c) acquisition-related expenses.   
    
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , FFO   increased   by   $24.5 million  , or   11.3%  , to   $241.9 million  , compared to   $217.4 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Excluding   $6.6 million   of accelerated non cash accretion of an above-market ground lease from the acquisition of the fee under one of our Honolulu buildings in the first quarter of 2015, our FFO   increased   by   $31.1 million   or   14.7%   for the same reasons described in the previous paragraph. 
    
  Reconciliation to GAAP    
    
  The table below (in thousands) reconciles our FFO (which includes the FFO attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership but excludes the FFO attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated joint ventures) to net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP:  

_____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Adjusts for (i) the net income and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets that is attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated joint ventures and (ii) our share of our unconsolidated Funds depreciation and amortization of real estate assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General  
    
  We have typically financed our capital needs through lines of credit and long-term secured loans.  To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our cash flows from operations, some of our long-term secured loans carry fixed interest rates, and we generally enter into interest rate swap agreements with respect to our loans with floating interest rates.  These swap agreements generally expire between one to two years before the maturity date of the related loan, during which time we can refinance the loan without any interest penalty.  See Notes   7   and   9   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more detail regarding our debt and derivatives.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had consolidated debt of   $4.44 billion  , which included the debt of our consolidated joint ventures.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.60 billion   of our consolidated debt had an interest rate that was effectively fixed under the terms of the loan or a swap, with (i) a weighted average remaining life of   5.0 years  , (ii) a weighted average remaining period during which the interest rate was fixed of   3.1 years  , (iii) a weighted average annual interest rate of   3.24%   and (iv) including non-cash amortization of deferred loan costs, a weighted average annual interest rate of   3.39%  .  
     
  Financing Activity for   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    
    
  For a description of our financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , please see "Acquisitions and Dispositions, Financings, Developments and Repositionings" above. 
    
  Short term liquidity 
    
  Excluding potential acquisitions and debt refinancings, we expect to meet our short term operating liquidity requirements through cash on hand, cash generated by operations, and as necessary, our   $400 million   revolving credit facility.  See Note   7   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our revolving credit facility.  
    
  We are currently developing two multifamily projects, one in our Brentwood submarket in Los Angeles, and one in Honolulu, Hawaii, please see "Acquisitions and Dispositions, Financings, Developments and Repositionings" above.  We intend to finance the costs of these development projects through cash on hand, cash generated by operations, and as necessary, our revolving credit facility.  
    
  Long term liquidity  
    
  Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, developments and repositioning of properties, non-recurring capital expenditures and refinancing of indebtedness.  We do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of these long-term cash requirements.  The nature of our business, and the requirements imposed by REIT federal tax rules that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis, may cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over the long term.  We plan to meet our additional long-term liquidity needs through long-term secured indebtedness, the issuance of equity securities, including OP Units, property dispositions and joint venture transactions.  We have an ATM program which would allow us, subject to market conditions, to sell up to an additional   $350 million   as of the date of this Report.  
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  See Note   7   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for information regarding our minimum future principal payments due on our secured notes payable and revolving credit facility, as well as the interest rates that determine our future periodic interest payments, Note   15   for information regarding our minimum future ground lease payments, and Note   16   for information regarding our contractual obligations related to our Moanalua development.

Cash Flows 
    
  Comparison of   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities   
    
  Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants and the level of  our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs.  Net cash   provided by   operating activities   increased   by   $60.0 million   to   $265.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $205.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in cash operating income from our office portfolio due to acquisitions, (ii) an increase in cash operating income from our multifamily portfolio due to higher rental rates, partially offset by (iii) an increase in general and administrative expenses due to payroll taxes from the exercise of options, (iv) an increase in cash interest expense due to higher debt balances, and (v) an increase in acquisition-related expenses.  
    
  Cash flows from investing activities   
    
  Our net cash   used in   investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, developments and redevelopment projects, and recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures.  Net cash   used in   investing activities   increased   by   $1.19 billion   to   $1.33 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $137.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase primarily reflects the expenditure of   $1.62 billion   for acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds of   $348.2 million   from the sales of investments in real estate.  See Note   3   to our consolidated financial statements in   Item 1   of this Report for more detail regarding our acquisitions and dispositions. 
    
  Cash flows from financing activities   
    
  Our net cash related to financing activities is generally impacted by our borrowings and capital activities, as well as dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests, respectively.  Net cash   provided by   financing activities   increased   by   $1.19 billion   to   $1.12 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $76.8 million   cash used for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase primarily reflects an increase in net borrowings of  $764.5 million and equity contributed by noncontrolling interests to our consolidated joint ventures of   $459.8 million  , partially offset by taxes paid on the exercise of options of   $53.5 million  .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Description of our Unconsolidated Funds 
    
  We manage and own equity interests in   two   unconsolidated Funds, Fund X and Partnership X, through which we and investors own   eight   office properties totaling   1.8 million   square feet.  At   September 30, 2016  , we held equity interests of   68.61%   of Fund X and   24.25%   of Partnership X.  Our Funds pay us fees and reimburse us for certain expenses related to property management and other services we provide to our Funds.  We also receive distributions based on invested capital and on any profits that exceed certain specified cash returns to the investors.  See Note   5   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our unconsolidated Funds.  
    
  Debt of our Unconsolidated Funds  
    
  We do not have any debt outstanding in connection with our interest in our unconsolidated Funds, however each of our Funds has their own debt secured by the properties that they own.  The table below summarizes the debt of our Funds as of   September 30, 2016  , the amounts represent 100% (not our pro-rata share) of amounts related to our Funds: 

_____________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    We made certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non-recourse carve-outs under these loans, and also guaranteed the related swaps, although we have an indemnity from our   unconsolidated   Funds for any amounts that we would be required to pay under these agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the obligations under the loans and swap agreements have been performed by our   unconsolidated   Funds in accordance with the terms of those agreements. 
              (2) 
    Floating rate term loan, swapped to fixed, which is secured by six properties and requires monthly payments of interest only, with the outstanding principal due upon maturity.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,  assuming a zero-percent LIBOR interest rate during the remaining life of the swap, the maximum future payments under the swap agreement were   $1.2 million  . 
              (3) 
    Floating rate term loan, swapped to fixed, which is secured by two properties and requires monthly payments of interest only, with the outstanding principal due upon maturity.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,  assuming a zero-percent LIBOR interest rate during the remaining life of the swap, the maximum future payments under the swap agreement were   $4.4 million  . 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  We have not made any material changes during the period covered by this Report to our critical accounting policies disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting literature, see Note   2   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report. 
       
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates of certain items.  These estimates, which are inherently subjective and subject to change, affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. While we believe that our estimates are based upon reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time that they were made, some of our estimates will inevitably prove to be incorrect, and as a result, actual outcomes will could differ from our estimates, and those differences positive or negative could be material.  Some of our estimates are subject to adjustment as we believe appropriate, based on revised estimates, and reconciliation to actual results when available.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  We use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk related to our floating rate borrowings.  However, our use of these instruments does expose us to credit risk from the potential inability of our counterparties to perform under the terms of those agreements.  We attempt to minimize this credit risk by contracting with a variety of high-quality financial counterparties.  See Notes   7   and   9   to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt and derivatives. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   18.9%   of our debt was unhedged floating rate debt.  A fifty-basis point change in the one month USD LIBOR interest rate would result in an annual impact to our earnings (through interest expense) of approximately $4.2 million.  We calculate interest sensitivity by multiplying the amount of unhedged floating rate debt by fifty-basis points.  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) at the end of the period covered by this Report.  Based on the foregoing, our CEO and CFO concluded, as of that time, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
