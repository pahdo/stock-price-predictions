DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS    

Quinpario
Acquisition Corp. 2 ( us ,  we ,  Company  or  our ) is a blank check company
incorporated in Delaware on July 15, 2014. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities ( Business
Combination ). All activity through September 30, 2016 relates to the Company s formation, initial public offering
described below and search for a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such,
the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.  

The
registration statement for the Company s initial public offering ( Initial Public Offering ) was declared effective
on January 15, 2015. The Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 35,000,000 units ( Units ) at $10.00 per
Unit on January 22, 2015, generating gross proceeds of $350,000,000, which is described in Note 3.  

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of 18,000,000 warrants ( Private
Placement Warrants ) at a price of $0.50 per warrant to Quinpario Partners 2, LLC, the Company s sponsor ( Sponsor ),
generating gross proceeds of $9,000,000, which is described in Note 3.  

Transaction
costs amounted to $19,805,250, consisting of $7,000,000 of underwriting fees, $12,250,000 of deferred underwriting fees (which
are held in the Trust Account (defined below)), $555,250 of Initial Public Offering costs and $63,920 of other expenses incurred
through January 22, 2015. In addition, $1,380,830 of cash was available to fund operations and held outside of the Trust Account
on January 22, 2015.  

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 22, 2015, an amount of $350,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds
of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account ( Trust
Account ) and has been invested in U.S. treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in an open
ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs
(c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invests solely in U.S. treasuries, as determined
by the Company. Such proceeds will continue to be held in such investments until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business
Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.  

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public
Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward
consummating a Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully affect a
Business Combination.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   (continued)   

We
will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders
may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their
pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders
with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote)
for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable),
in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our
proposed Business Combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in
our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction
would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we engage in a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) which will contain substantially the same financial and other information
about the initial Business Combination as is required under the SEC s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial Business
Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder
approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company provides that a public stockholder, together
with any affiliate or other person with whom such public stockholder is acting in concert or as a  group  (within
the meaning of Section 13 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the  Securities Act )), will be restricted from
seeking redemption rights with respect to an aggregate of more than 15% of the public shares (but only with respect to the amount
over 15% of the public shares).  

The
Company s Units, common stock and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market ( NASDAQ ). Pursuant to the
NASDAQ listing rules, the Company s initial Business Combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective
fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and
taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such Business Combination, although this may entail
simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to affect a Business
Combination successfully.  

The
Company will have until January 22, 2017 to consummate its initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable to consummate
an initial Business Combination within such time period, it will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account and then
seek to dissolve and liquidate. In such event, the warrants will expire worthless. The Company expects the redemption price to
be $10.00 per share of common stock, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, the Company may not
be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of public stockholders.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis
of presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal accrual) considered for a fair presentation have
been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information refer to the financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with
the SEC on March 28, 2016.  

Cash
and marketable securities held in Trust Account   

The
amounts held in the Trust Account represent substantially all of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and are classified
as restricted assets since such amounts can only be used by the Company in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash and trading securities held in the Trust Account consisted of $350,807,759
and $350,154,498, respectively, in United States Treasury Bills with an original maturity of three months or less and $2,492 and
$770 in cash at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

Shares
subject to possible redemption   

The
Company accounts for its shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.  Shares subject to mandatory redemption (if
any) are classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable shares (including shares that
feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain
events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, shares are classified
as stockholders  equity. The Company s shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside
of the Company s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, 33,308,403 and 33,364,647, respectively, shares subject to possible redemption in the amount of $333,855,126 and $333,794,485,
respectively are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders  equity section of the Company s balance
sheet.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)   

Net
income (loss) per common share    

The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share.  Net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company has not considered
the effect of (i) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering to purchase 17,500,000 shares of the Company and (ii) the Private
Placement Warrants to purchase 9,000,000 shares of the Company, in the calculation of net income (loss) per share, since the exercise
of the warrants is contingent on the occurrence of future events. 33,308,403 and 33,380,894 shares subject to possible redemption
at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, were also excluded from the calculation of basic income (loss) per
ordinary share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the trust earnings. At September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company did not have any other dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially,
be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss)
per common share is the same as basic income (loss) per common share for the periods.   

Concentration
of credit risk    

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution
which, at times may exceed the federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these
accounts and since the Company maintains its cash accounts with major financial institutions, management believes the Company
is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.  

Fair
value of financial instruments    

The
fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures,  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to
their short-term nature.  

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)   

Income
taxes    

The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of FASB ASC, 740,  Income Taxes,  which requires an
asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future
taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.  

There
were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016. FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest
and penalties at September 30, 2016. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant
payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.  

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by U.S. federal and state authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential
examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions
and compliance with U.S. federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Federal and Missouri income tax returns for 2014 and 2015 are
currently open to examination although no audits are ongoing.  

Recently
issued accounting standards    

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company s financial statements.

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING   

On
January 22, 2015, the Company sold 35,000,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock and one
warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75 per half
share. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise
of the warrants. Each warrant will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of an initial Business Combination and will
expire five years after the completion of an initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption. We may redeem the outstanding
warrants (excluding the Private Placement Warrants), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant:  

upon
    a minimum of 30 days  prior written notice of redemption,   

if,
    and only if, the last sales price of our shares of common stock equals or exceeds $24.00 per share for any 20 trading days
    within a 30 trading day period (the  30-day trading period ) ending three business days before we send the notice
    of redemption, and   

if,
    and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such
    warrants commencing five business days prior to the 30-day trading period and continuing each day thereafter until the date
    of redemption.   

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to
exercise warrants to do so on a  cashless basis.   

Simultaneously
with the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 18,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $0.50
per warrant ($9,000,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement. The proceeds from the purchase of the Private Placement Warrants
were placed in the Trust Account.  

The
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except the
Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, in each
case so long as they continue to be held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The purchaser has also agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants or underlying securities (subject to certain exceptions) until 30 days after
the completion of an initial Business Combination.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

In
September 2014, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 10,062,500 shares of our common stock (the  Insider Shares ),
for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. The managing member of the Sponsor is Quinpario Partners LLC ( Quinpario Partners ),
an entity affiliated with several of our officers and directors. On November 10, 2014, the Sponsor transferred 300,000 Insider
Shares to independent directors of the Company. The Insider Shares held by our initial stockholders, which include the Sponsor,
management team and directors, included an aggregate of up to 1,312,500 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters 
over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so that our initial stockholders would collectively own 20.0% of our
issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming they did not purchase units in the Initial Public Offering).
On January 22, 2015, the underwriters informed the Company that they were waiving their right to exercise any portion of their
over-allotment option. As a result, the Sponsor forfeited an aggregate of 1,312,500 Insider Shares, leaving the initial stockholders
with an aggregate of 8,750,000 Insider Shares. The Company has recorded the forfeited shares as treasury stock and simultaneously
retired and cancelled the shares and charged additional paid-in capital.  

The
initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Insider Shares (except to certain permitted transferees)
until (1) with respect to 20% of the Insider Shares, the consummation of an initial Business Combination and (2) with respect
to the remaining 80% of the Insider Shares, the earlier of one year after the date of the consummation of an initial Business
Combination or if after 150 days after an initial Business Combination, the closing price of the Company s common stock
equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for
any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing transfer restrictions will
be removed earlier if, after an initial Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent (i) liquidation, merger, stock
exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company s stockholders having the right to exchange their
shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property or (ii) consolidation, merger or other change in the majority of
the Company s management team.  

In
order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor, officers and directors
and their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount
they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note. The notes
would either be paid upon consummation of an initial Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion,
up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of the Business Combination into additional Private Placement
Warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant. If we do not complete a Business Combination, the loans will not be repaid.  

Quinpario
Partners had loaned and advanced to us a total of $325,370 which was used to pay operating expenses and costs associated with
the Initial Public Offering. These loans and advances were non-interest bearing, unsecured and repaid at the consummation of the
Initial Public Offering out of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering.  

Quinpario
Partners and Jeffry N. Quinn, our former Chairman, have agreed that they will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust
Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for
services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but they may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations
if they are required to do so. Furthermore, they will have no liability under this indemnity as to any claimed amounts owed to
a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   (continued)   

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into on January 15, 2015 with the Company s initial stockholders, the Company
is required to register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. The holders of a majority of these securities are
entitled to make up to three demands that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain  piggy-back 
registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of an initial Business Combination.
The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.  

Quinpario
Partners has agreed that, commencing on January 15, 2015 through the earlier of our consummation of an initial Business Combination
or our liquidation, it will make available to us certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities
and administrative support, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay Quinpario Partners $10,000 per month for
these services. Total expenses paid for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $30,000 and $90,000, respectively
and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $30,000 and $80,000, respectively.  

In
November 2015, the Company reimbursed Quinpario Partners $38,522 for dues and subscriptions relating to systems that the Company
utilizes in search for a target business.

COMMITMENTS   CONTINGENCIES    

The
underwriters are entitled to an underwriting discount of five and one-half percent (5.5%), of which two percent (2.0%), or $7,000,000,
was paid in cash at the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 22, 2015, and three and one-half percent (3.5%), or
$12,250,000, has been deferred. The deferred fee will be payable in cash upon the closing of an initial Business Combination.
The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the
Company completes the Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. If an initial Business Combination
is not consummated, the deferred fees will not be paid.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

References
to the  Company,   us,   we  or  our  refer to Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2.
The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with the interim financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained
in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  

Forward-Looking
Statements    

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking
statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
 may,   should,   could,   would,   expect,   plan,   anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate,   continue,  or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions.
Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other SEC
filings.    

Overview   

We
are a blank check company formed on July 15, 2014 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities ( Business Combination ).
We are actively searching for a target business for our initial Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our initial Business
Combination using cash from the proceeds of the public offering described below and the private placement of the private placement
warrants described below, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.  

Results
of Operations    

We
have not generated any revenues to date.  Our entire activity from inception to the closing
of our initial public offering ( Initial Public Offering ) on January 22, 2015 was in preparation for that event.  Subsequent
to the Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the evaluation of Business Combination candidates, and we will
not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We have, and expect
to continue to generate small amounts of non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. Interest
income is not expected to be significant in view of current low interest rates on risk-free investments (treasury securities).
We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing
compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had net income of $52,574 and net loss of $93,945, respectively,
which consisted of operating costs, offset by interest income of $278,898 and $50,442, respectively, on the funds held in the
trust account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering ( Trust Account ). For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had net income of $60,642 and net loss of $260,587, respectively, which consisted
of operating costs, offset by interest income of $906,983 and $102,116, respectively, on the funds held in the Trust Account and
$500,000 received in the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 for the reimbursement of due diligence expenses that the Company
incurred in connection with evaluating a potential business combination that did not materialize. Our operating expenses principally
consisted of expenses related to our public filings and listing and identification and due diligence related to a potential
target business, and to general operating expenses including printing, insurance and office expenses. Until we consummate a Business
Combination, we will have no operating revenues.   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Through
September 30, 2016, our liquidity needs have been satisfied through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of shares to Quinpario Partners
2, LLC, our sponsor ( Sponsor ), loans and advances from Quinpario Partners LLC, an affiliate of our Sponsor, totaling
$325,370, and $1,380,830 of cash from the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering. As of the date of this filing, all loans
and advances have been repaid to Quinpario Partners LLC from the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering.  

On
January 22, 2015, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 35,000,000 units ( Units ) at a price of $10.00 per
Unit. Simultaneously with the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of 18,000,000
warrants ( Private Placement Warrants ) to our Sponsor for $9,000,000. We received net proceeds from our Initial Public
Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $351,380,830, net of the non-deferred portion of the underwriting commissions
of $7,000,000, offering costs of $555,250 and other expenses of $63,920. For a description of the proceeds generated in our Initial
Public Offering and a discussion of the use of such proceeds, we refer you to Part II, Item 2 of this report.  

We
will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to provide us with additional working
capital to pay any taxes that we may owe. As described elsewhere in this report, the amounts in the Trust Account may be invested
only in U.S. government treasury securities with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S.
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.  

We
believe the $339,129 in cash will be sufficient to identify one or more target businesses, conduct due diligence and complete
our initial Business Combination. However, we may need to seek additional capital to continue our operations. If additional capital
is required, we intend to borrow sufficient funds from Quinpario Partners, LLC or the management team to operate until we close
our initial Business Combination. Neither Quinpario Partners, LLC nor our management team is under any obligation to advance funds
to us. Any loan would be evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note. Up to $1,500,000 of such notes may be convertible
into additional Private Placement Warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant of the post business combination entity. Any such loans
would be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial Business
Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to
us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account.  

For
the period from January 22, 2015 (consummation of our Initial Public Offering) through September 30, 2016, we disbursed an aggregate
of $1,809,843 out of the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering not held in Trust Account and the proceeds from the sale of the
Insider Shares, for legal expenses, accounting expenses and filing fees relating to our SEC reporting obligations, general corporate
matters, and miscellaneous expenses. On June 19, 2015 the Company received a $500,000 reimbursement for expenses that it incurred
conducting due diligence on a potential business combination that did not materialize. As of September 30, 2016, there was a cash
balance of $339,129 not held in the Trust Account.   

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.
We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often
referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements.  

Contractual
obligations   

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than a monthly
fee of $10,000 payable to Quinpario Partners LLC for office space, administrative services and secretarial support.  

We
began incurring these fees on January 15, 2015, the date the Company s securities were first listed on the NASDAQ Capital
Market and will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the liquidation of the Company.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of interim financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim financial statements, and
revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified
the following as our critical accounting policies:  

Redeemable
common stock    

All
of the 35,000,000 common shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering (the  Public Shares ) contain
a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of common shares under the Company's liquidation or tender offer/stockholder
approval provisions. In accordance with ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the
security to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation
of all of the entity's equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company does not specify
a maximum redemption threshold, its amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will the Company
redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (stockholders' equity) to be less than $5,000,001.  

The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and will adjust the carrying value of the security to
equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common
stock shall be affected by charges against paid-in capital.  

Net
income (loss) per common share   

Income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental
common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants (using the treasury stock method). Diluted loss per share excludes the shares
issuable upon the exercise of warrants from the calculation of net loss per share if their effect would be antidilutive.     

Income
taxes   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which
the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements .  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company s financial statements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Market
risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates, foreign exchanges, commodity prices, equity prices and other market
driven rates or prices. We are a blank check company incorporated on July 15, 2014 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the
purpose of effecting a Business Combination with one or more businesses or entities. We are not presently engaged in and, if we
do not consummate a suitable Business Combination prior to the prescribed liquidation date of the Trust Account, we may not engage
in, any substantive commercial business. Accordingly, we are not and, until such time as we consummate a Business Combination,
we will not be, exposed to significant risks associated with foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices or other
market driven rates or prices. The net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account may be invested by the
trustee only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing
solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Given our limited risk
in our exposure to government securities and money market funds, we do not view the interest rate risk to be significant.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of June 30, 2016. Based upon his evaluation, our principal executive officer and principle financial and accounting officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.  

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

None.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

As
of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

On
January 22, 2015, the Sponsor purchased 18,000,000 Private Placement Warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our common
stock exercisable at $5.75 per half share, at a price of $0.50 per warrant ($9,000,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement
that occurred simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The purchase price of the Private Placement
Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and is being held in the Trust Account. If we do not complete
a Business Combination by January 22, 2017, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account
will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law). There will be no redemption
rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless. The sale of the
Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  

Use
of Proceeds from the Initial Public Offering   

On
January 22, 2015, the Company sold 35,000,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. Each Unit consists of one
share of the Company s common stock, $0.0001 par value, and one warrant. Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase
one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share and will become exercisable on the later of
(a) 30 days after the consummation of our Business Combination, or (b) January 22, 2016. The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m.,
New York time, on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the Trust Account. The
warrants (excluding the Private Placement Warrants so long as such warrants are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees)
will be redeemable by the Company, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant at any time the warrants are exercisable,
upon a minimum of 30 days  prior written notice of redemption, if, and only if, the last sales price of our shares of common
stock equals or exceeds $24.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending three business days before
we send the notice of redemption, and if, and only if there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the
shares of common stock underlying such warrants commencing five business days prior to the 30-day trading period and continuing
each day thereafter until the date of redemption. The Units in the Initial Public Offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00
per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $350,000,000. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. acted
as representatives and joint book-runners of the Initial Public Offering (together, the  Underwriters ). The securities
sold in the Initial Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-
198988). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on January 15, 2015.  

We
paid a total of $7,000,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, $555,250 of offering costs and $63,920 of other expenses
incurred through January 22, 2015. In addition, the Underwriters agreed to defer $12,250,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions,
which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, if consummated. We also repaid all loans and
advances outstanding to an affiliate of our Sponsor (an entity controlled by our Chairman) from the proceeds of the Initial Public
Offering.  

After
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $12,250,000 in underwriting discounts
and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the offering
expenses, the total net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants
was $351,380,830, of which $350,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. The remaining amount of $1,380,830 was being held outside
the Trust Account and is being used to fund the Company s operating expenses. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may
be invested by the trustee only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.

4  
      I
    am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
