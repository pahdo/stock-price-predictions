NOTE 1. 
    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  Background 
  CSX Corporation ( CSX ), together with its subsidiaries (the  Company ), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies.  The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers.    
    
  CSX's principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. ( CSXT ), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately   21,000   route mile rail network, which serves major population centers in   23   states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  The Company's intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals.  
    
  Other entities 
  In addition to CSXT, the Company s subsidiaries include CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. ( CSX Intermodal Terminals ), Total Distribution Services, Inc. ( TDSI ), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. ( Transflo ), CSX Technology, Inc. ( CSX Technology ) and other subsidiaries. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States and also performs drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers and trucking dispatch operations. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which include shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.  
       
  CSX s other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the Company s operating and non-operating real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. These activities are classified in either operating income or other income - net depending upon the nature of the activity.  Results of these activities fluctuate with the timing of real estate transactions. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the following:  

Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been omitted from these interim financial statements.  CSX suggests that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes included in CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed current reports on Form 8-K.

  Fiscal Year 
  CSX follows a   52  /53 week fiscal reporting calendar with the last day of each reporting period ending on a Friday:    
          
  Except as otherwise specified, references to    third   quarter(s)  or    nine   months  indicate CSX's fiscal periods ending   September 23, 2016   and   September 25, 2015  , and references to "year-end" indicate the fiscal year ended   December 25, 2015  . 
    
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on uncollectible amounts related to freight receivables, government reimbursement receivables, claims for damages and other various receivables. The allowance is based upon the creditworthiness of customers, historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions. Uncollectible amounts are charged against the allowance account.  Allowance for doubtful accounts of   $29 million   and $  37 million   is included in the consolidated balance sheets as of the end of   third   quarter   2016   and   December 25, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU"),   Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  , which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than being recorded in additional paid-in capital. The Company adopted the provisions of this rule during the second quarter of 2016 which did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires that all deferred income taxes be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet, rather than being separated into current and noncurrent amounts. The Company adopted the provisions of this rule during second quarter 2016 and applied them retrospectively. Current deferred income tax assets of   $126 million   as of December 25, 2015 have been reclassified and reported as a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities on the balance sheet. Adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU,   Leases  , which will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability, and lessors to recognize a net lease investment. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures will also be required. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. While the Company is still assessing the impact of this standard, CSX does not believe this standard will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 2.    Earnings Per Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share and earnings per share, assuming dilution: 

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.  Earnings per share, assuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock equivalents outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments.  CSX's potentially dilutive instruments are made up of equity awards, which include long-term incentive awards, and employee stock options. 
    
  The   Earnings Per Share Topic   in the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") requires CSX to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution.  The additional shares included in diluted earnings per share represent the number of shares that would be issued if all of the above potentially dilutive instruments were converted into CSX common stock.  
    
  When calculating diluted earnings per share, this rule requires CSX to include the potential shares that would be outstanding if all outstanding stock options were exercised. This number is different from outstanding stock options, which is included in Note 3, Share-Based Compensation, because it is offset by shares CSX could repurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical exercises to obtain the common stock equivalent. Approximately   2.4 million   and   3.8 million   of total average outstanding stock options for the third quarter and   nine months ended     2016  , respectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect was antidilutive. There were no stock options outstanding for third quarter 2015.

  Share Repurchases 
  In April 2015, the Company announced a new   $2 billion   share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2017.  During the third quarters     of   2016   and 2015, the Company repurchased approximately   $263 million  , or   ten million   shares, and   $262 million  , or   nine million   shares, respectively.  During the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , the Company repurchased   $778 million  , or   30 million   shares, and   $546 million  , or   17 million   shares, respectively. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase.  Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases.  Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.  In accordance with the   Equity Topic   in the ASC, the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. Generally, retained earnings is only impacted by net earnings and dividends. 

NOTE 3.     Share-Based Compensation 
    
  Under CSX's share-based compensation plans, awards consist of performance units, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock options for management and stock grants for directors.  Awards granted under the various programs are determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or, in certain circumstances, by the Chief Executive Officer for awards to management employees other than senior executives.  The Board of Directors approves awards granted to the Company's non-management directors upon recommendation of the Governance Committee.   
    
  In   February 2016  , the Company granted performance units, restricted stock units and stock options as part of the Company's long-term share-based compensation plans.    
    
  Long-term Incentive Plan 
    
    Approximately   839 thousand   performance units were granted to certain employees under a new long-term incentive plan ("2016-2018 LTIP"). The 2016-2018 LTIP was adopted under the CSX Stock and Incentive Award Plan.  Payouts of performance units for the cycle ending with fiscal year 2018 will be based on the achievement of goals related to both operating ratio and return on assets in each case excluding non-recurring items as disclosed in the Company's financial statements.  The cumulative operating ratio and average return on assets over the plan period will each comprise 50% of the payout and will be measured independently of the other.  
    
  Grants were made in performance units, with each unit representing the right to receive one share of CSX common stock, and payouts will be made in CSX common stock. The payout range for participants will be between   0%   and   200%   of the target awards depending on Company performance against predetermined goals. Payouts for certain executive officers are subject to downward adjustment by up to   30%   based upon total shareholder return relative to specified comparable groups.  
    
  Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The Company granted approximately   419 thousand   restricted stock units. The restricted stock units vest   three   years after the date of grant. Participants receive cash dividend equivalents on the unvested shares during the restriction period. These awards are time-based and are not based upon attainment of performance goals.

NOTE 3.     Share-Based Compensation,   continued 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  The Company granted approximately   2.4 million   stock options. The fair value of stock options on the date of grant was   $4.68   per share which was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  Stock options have been granted with   ten  -year terms and vest   three   years after the date of grant. The exercise price for stock options granted equals the closing market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  These awards are time-based and are not based upon attainment of performance goals.  
    
  The terms of performance units, restricted stock units and stock options all require participants to be employed through the final day of the respective performance or vesting period as applicable, except in the case of death, disability or retirement. For information related to the Company's other outstanding long-term incentive compensation, see CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Total pre-tax expense associated with all share-based compensation and the related income tax benefit are as follows:  

NOTE 4. 
    Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves 
                
  Casualty, environmental and other reserves are considered critical accounting estimates due to the need for significant management judgment. They are provided for in the consolidated balance sheets as shown in the table below: 

These liabilities are accrued when estimable and probable in accordance with the   Contingencies Topic   in the ASC.  Actual settlements and claims received could differ, and final outcomes of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Considering the legal defenses currently available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of management that none of these items individually, when finally resolved, will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, they could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.

NOTE 4.    Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves,   continued 
    
  Casualty  
   Casualty reserves of   $247 million   and   $269 million   as of   September 23, 2016   and   December 25, 2015  , respectively, represent accruals for personal injury, asbestos and occupational injury claims.  The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $  50 million   per occurrence.  Currently,   no   individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the   Contingencies Topic   in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. 
    
  Personal Injury 
            Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries.  Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers  Liability Act ( FELA ). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other current or former CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers  compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers  Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.  
           
  CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims.  An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management.  This analysis for the quarter resulted in an immaterial adjustment to the personal injury reserve. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. 
    
  Asbestos   Occupational 
  The Company is party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. Management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly.  Unasserted or incurred but not reported ("IBNR") asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party specialist and reviewed by management annually. 
       
  CSXT s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates are analyzed to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSXT s employment records and industry data.  From this analysis, the specialist estimates the IBNR claims liabilities. 
    
  Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as  irritants ) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.

NOTE 4.    Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves,   continued 
    
  Environmental 
  Environmental reserves were   $79 million   and   $82 million   as of   September 23, 2016   and   December 25, 2015  , respectively.  The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately   225   environmentally impaired sites.  Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes.  Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations.  A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal.  In addition, some of the Company's land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.  
    
  In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct.  These costs could be substantial. 
    
  In accordance with the   Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic   in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:    
             
    type of clean-up required; 
                
    nature of the Company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);  
                
    extent of the Company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and  
                
    number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.  
       
  Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable.  The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted.  The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries.  Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years.  Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement. 
    
  Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated.  Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the estimated cost of remedial actions currently required.

  Other  
  Other reserves of   $48 million   and   $49 million   as of   September 23, 2016   and   December 25, 2015  , include liabilities for various claims, such as property, automobile and general liability.  Also included in other reserves are longshoremen disability claims related to a previously owned international shipping business (these claims are in runoff) as well as claims for current port employees. 

NOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Insurance 
    The Company maintains numerous insurance programs with substantial limits for property damage (which includes business interruption) and third-party liability.  A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each of the property and liability programs.  The Company has a $  25 million   retention per occurrence for the non-catastrophic property program (such as a derailment) and a $  50 million   retention per occurrence for the liability and catastrophic property programs (such as hurricanes and floods).  While the Company believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. 
    
  Legal 
         The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters, environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or property claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges.  Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions.  While the final outcome of these matters cannot be reasonably determined, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  An unexpected adverse resolution of   one   or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. 
  The Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess of reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be   $6 million   to   $115 million   in aggregate at   September 23, 2016  .  This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions.  Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate.

  Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation 
  In May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and   three   other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws.  In November 2007, the class action lawsuits were consolidated in federal court in the District of Columbia, where they are now pending.  The suit seeks treble damages allegedly sustained by purported class members as well as attorneys' fees and other relief.  Plaintiffs are expected to allege damages at least equal to the fuel surcharges at issue.  
    
  In June 2012, the District Court certified the case as a class action. The decision was not a ruling on the merits of plaintiffs' claims, but rather a decision to allow the plaintiffs to seek to prove the case as a class. The defendant railroads petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for permission to appeal the District Court's class certification decision. In August 2013, the D.C. Circuit issued a decision vacating the class certification decision and remanded the case to the District Court to reconsider its class certification decision. The District Court remand proceedings are underway and the class certification hearing was held in September 2016. The District Court has delayed proceedings on the merits of the case pending the outcome of the class certification remand proceedings. The court has given no indication of timing on its ruling regarding class certification. 
    
  CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of this matter or an unexpected adverse decision on the merits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. 
    
  Environmental 
  CSXT is indemnifying Pharmacia LLC (formerly known as Monsanto Company) for certain liabilities associated with real estate located in Kearny, New Jersey along the Lower Passaic River (the  Property ). The Property, which was formerly owned by Pharmacia, is now owned by CSXT. CSXT's indemnification and defense duties arise with respect to several matters.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks cleanup and removal costs and other damages associated with the presence of hazardous substances in the   17  -mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the "Study Area ).  CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially responsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA.  
    
  In March 2016, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency s mandated remedial process for the lower   8   miles of the Study Area, which was based on a Focused Feasibility Study.  EPA has estimated that it will take the potentially responsible parties approximately   ten   years to complete the work.  At a later date, EPA will select a remedy for the remainder of the Study Area and is expected to again seek the participation of private parties to implement the selected remedy using EPA s CERCLA authority to compel such participation, if necessary.  
    
  CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in a cooperative natural resource damages assessment process related to the Property.  Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe any indemnification or remediation costs potentially allocable to CSXT with respect to the Property and the Study Area would be material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 6.    Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel.  For employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.   
    
  In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older (Medicare-eligible) are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Eligible retirees younger than 65 years (non-Medicare eligible) are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees.  The life insurance plan is non-contributory. 
    
  The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management. The following table describes the components of expense / (income) related to net benefit expense recorded in labor and fringe on the income statement. 

(a) Special termination benefits were charges in 2015 that resulted from a management workforce reduction program initiated in 2014.

NOTE 6.    Employee Benefit Plans,   continued 
    
    Qualified pension plan obligations are funded in accordance with regulatory requirements and with an objective of meeting or exceeding minimum funding requirements necessary to avoid restrictions on flexibility of plan operation and benefit payments. Although no contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans were required, CSX made a   $30 million   voluntary contribution during   September 2016  . The Company may make an additional voluntary contribution in   2016  .  

NOTE 7.    Debt and Credit Agreements 
    
  Total activity related to long-term debt as of the end of   third   quarter   2016   is shown in the table below. For fair value information related to the Company's long-term debt, see Note 9, Fair Value Measurements. 

(a) Long-term debt as of December 2015 includes debt issue costs of   $168 million   that were reclassified from long-term assets to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of ASU, Interest - Imputation of Interest, which became effective for CSX during first quarter 2016. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    CSX has a   $1 billion   unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in   May 2020  , and as of the date of this filing, the Company has   no   outstanding balances under this facility.  The facility allows borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based) interest rates, plus a spread, depending upon CSX's senior unsecured debt ratings. LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate which is a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds.  As of   third   quarter   2016  , CSX was in compliance with all covenant requirements under this facility.  
    
  Receivables Securitization Facility 
  Subsequent to the third quarter, on September 28, 2016, the Company renewed and modified its existing receivables securitization facility. The facility was to expire in June 2017 and is now extended with a similar   three  -year term scheduled to expire in   September 2019  . It was also modified to provide liquidity of up to   $200 million  , changed from   $250 million  , along with modifications to other terms. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. As of the date of this filing, the Company has   no   outstanding balances under this facility.

NOTE 9.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The   Financial Instruments Topic   in the ASC requires     disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in annual reports as well as in quarterly reports.  For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt.  Disclosure of the fair value of pension plan assets is only required annually.  Also, this rule clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.  
    
  Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets and long-term debt.  The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.  These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 

Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 
                
    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.); and 
                
    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of investments). 
       
  The valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 
    
  Investments 
  The Company's investment assets, valued with assistance from a third-party trustee, consist of certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government securities and auction rate securities and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet per the   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic   in the     ASC.  There are several valuation methodologies used for those assets as described below.  

Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper (Level 2)  : Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value;  
                
    Corporate Bonds and Government Securities (Level 2)  : Valued using broker quotes that utilize observable market inputs; and 
                
    Auction Rate Securities (Level 3)  : Valued using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions, because there is currently no active market for trading.  
          
  The Company's investment assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as summarized in the table below.  Additionally, the amortized cost basis of these investments was   $223 million   and   $920 million   as of   September 23, 2016   and   December 25, 2015  , respectively.

NOTE 9.    Fair Value Measurements,   continued 

These investments have the following maturities: 

Long-term Debt 
    Long-term debt is reported at carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheets and is the Company's only financial instrument with fair values significantly different from their carrying amounts. The majority of the Company's long-term debt is valued with assistance from an independent third party adviser that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market values of comparable debt.  For those instruments not valued by the independent adviser, the fair value has been estimated by applying market rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments and maturities. These market rates are provided by the same independent adviser. All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are Level 2 inputs. 
    
  The fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors.  Such factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, market conditions, credit ratings, values of similar financial instruments, size of the transaction, cash flow projections and comparable trades.  Fair value will exceed carrying value when the current market interest rate is lower than the interest rate at which the debt was originally issued.  The fair value of a company's debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions.  It does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules.   
    
  The fair value and carrying value of the Company's long-term debt is as follows:

NOTE 10.     Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  CSX reports comprehensive earnings or loss in accordance with the   Comprehensive Income Topic   in the ASC in the Consolidated Comprehensive Income Statement. Total comprehensive earnings are defined as all changes in shareholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders (e.g. issuance of equity securities and dividends). Generally, for CSX, total comprehensive earnings equal net earnings plus or minus adjustments for pension and other post-retirement liabilities. Total comprehensive earnings represent the activity for a period net of tax and were   $465 million   and   $518 million   for   third   quarters, and   $1,282 million   and   $1,523 million   for nine months      2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  While total comprehensive earnings is the activity in a period and is largely driven by net earnings in that period, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss ( AOCI ) represents the cumulative balance of other comprehensive income, net of tax, as of the balance sheet date. For CSX, AOCI is primarily the cumulative balance related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments and CSX's share of AOCI of equity method investees.   
    
  Changes in the AOCI balance by component are shown in the table below.  Amounts reclassified in pension and other post-employment benefits to net earnings relate to the amortization of actuarial losses and are included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statements.  See Note 6. Employee Benefit Plans for further information.  Other primarily represents CSX's share of AOCI of equity method investees. Amounts reclassified in other to net earnings are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. 

NOTE 11.    Summarized Consolidating Financial Data 
    
  In 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, sold secured equipment notes maturing in 2023 in a registered public offering.  CSX has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. In connection with the notes, the Company is providing the following condensed consolidating financial information in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements. Each entity in the consolidating financial information follows the same accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements, except for the use of the equity method of accounting to reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation and the allocation of certain expenses of CSX incurred for the benefit of its subsidiaries.

  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Third Quarter 2016 
  Revenue 
  Revenue was   down     $229 million   to   $2.7 billion   from the prior year's third quarter as price gains were more than offset by volume declines, lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative business mix. 
    
  Merchandise 
  Agricultural Sector 
  Agricultural and Food Products   -   Volume decline, primarily in grain products, reflected additional local truck sourcing to feed mills in lieu of longer-haul rail moves, spurred by a large southeastern crop. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar continued to support import grain as a supplement to domestic, rail-sourced grain.       
    
  Fertilizers   -   Volume increased modestly, as robust demand in Brazil drove strength in export phosphates.  This growth was partially offset as oversupply hampered nitrogen shipments leading to declines in domestic fertilizer.    
       
  Industrial Sector 
  Chemicals   -   Lower volume reflected ongoing difficulties in energy markets, specifically crude oil, in which economics are increasingly challenged for crude-by-rail to the East Coast. The continued ramp up of shipments of fly ash, a by-product of burning coal that requires environmental remediation and is now included in the realigned chemicals market, partially offset overall volume decline.    
    
  Automotive   -   Volume increased as North American light vehicle production continued at a high level and CSX experienced growth across several key customers. Movement of trucks and SUV s continued to outpace passenger cars, which was consistent with consumer buying patterns.    
    
  Metals and Equipment   -   Volume declined as CSX continued to cycle mill closures and lower production levels at remaining mills brought on by persistent, above-average import steel levels resulting from the strong U.S. dollar.    
    
  Housing and Construction Sector 
  Forest Products   -   Volume declined in paper products due to continued industry consolidation, electronic substitution and near-term losses to truck as a result of excess capacity and low prices. Further, a strong U.S. dollar challenged exports and increased imports that do not generally move by rail.    
       
  Minerals   -   Volume was down modestly, primarily as a result of reduced steel production, which hampered demand for lime, an input to steel making. However, aggregates movement continued at high levels, reflecting road and non-residential construction momentum, particularly in the south.

  CSX CORPORATION 
  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Coal 
  Domestic Utility Coal   -   Volume declines, though still significant, began to moderate as hot summer weather drove additional demand despite high coal inventories and low natural gas prices.    
    
  Domestic Coke, Iron Ore and Other   -   Volumes remained weak in the face of an oversupplied coke market driven by continued softness in domestic integrated steel production and the idling of a customer facility.    
    
  Export Coal   -   Volume was down due to oversupply in the world market and a strong U.S. dollar that continued to hinder U.S. producer competitiveness. However, both metallurgical and thermal benchmarks improved during the quarter such that the rate of volume decline became considerably less when compared to previous quarters.    
    
  Intermodal 
  Domestic   -   Volume decreased three percent driven by the competitive loss of some short-haul interchange traffic.  Despite ample over-the-road truck capacity, the balance of the domestic portfolio remained near historic highs, reflecting success with CSX s highway-to-rail conversion program and improved network service offerings and service levels.    
    
  International   -   Volume was down 12 percent, reflecting the continued cycling of a prior account loss and the weaker global freight environment.    

Expenses  
  Expenses   decreased     $137 million   to   $1.9 billion   year over year, primarily driven by efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs. Variances versus the prior year's third quarter are described below.  
    
  Labor and Fringe   expense   decreased     $25 million   due to the following: 
             
    Incentive compensation was $37 million higher reflecting the expected award payouts on existing plans. 
                
    Inflation resulted in $28 million of additional cost driven primarily by increased health and welfare costs. 
                
    Efficiency savings of $53 million were driven by lower operating support costs as a result of structural changes and reduced crew training. 
                
    Volume-related costs were $35 million lower.  
                
    Other costs decreased $2 million. 
       
  Materials, Supplies and Other   expense   decreased     $73 million   due to the following: 
             
    Inflation resulted in $9 million of additional cost. 
                
    Efficiency savings of $38 million were primarily related to lower operating support costs, driven by structural changes, and lower non-operating support costs, driven by broad cost containment. 
                
    Train accidents, casualty and freight loss were $22 million lower, primarily due to prior year train accidents costs that were higher than the current period. 
                
    Volume-related costs were $7 million lower. 
                
    Various other costs decreased $15 million. 
       
  Fuel   expense   decreased     $49 million   due to the following: 
             
    An 11 percent price decline was the primary driver for $20 million in fuel expense savings. 
                
    Efficiency savings of $15 million were primarily related to locomotive fuel reduction technology and process improvement. 
                
    Volume-related costs were $14 million lower. 
       
  Depreciation   expense   increased     $19 million   due to a larger asset base.

  CSX CORPORATION 
  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Equipment and Other Rents   expense   decreased     $9 million   due to the following: 
             
    Inflation resulted in $3 million of additional cost due to higher rates on automotive freight cars. 
                
    Volume-related costs were $3 million higher due to increases in automotive volume.    
                
    Efficiency savings of $6 million were due to improved car cycle times.    
                
    Other costs decreased $9 million primarily due to lower intermodal and other equipment rents. 
       
  Interest   expense   increased     $3 million   primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower average interest rates. 
    
  Other income - net     increased     $11 million     primarily due to a prior year environmental cleanup cost related to non-operating activities that did not repeat in the current year, as well as miscellaneous income items. 
    
  Income tax   expense   decreased     $32 million   primarily due to lower earnings. 
    
  Nine Months Results of Operations 
  Revenue     decreased     $998 million   reflecting significant volume declines, lower fuel recoveries and a $99 million year-over-year decline in other revenue related to payments received in 2015 from customers that did not meet volume commitments.  These impacts more than offset any pricing gains. 
  Expenses   were   lower   by   $590 million   driven by efficiency savings of $341 million and lower volume-related costs of $202 million as a result of structural changes and broad cost containment in the face of the dynamic market environment. In addition, the reduction in the price of fuel resulted in an expense decline of $154 million year-to-date. 
  Operating income     decreased     $408 million   primarily due to volume declines, partially offset by efficiency savings. 
  Interest expense     increased     $19 million   primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower average interest rates associated with newer debt. 
  Other income - net     increased     $20 million   due to several non-operating items, none of which were individually significant. 
  Income tax expense     decreased     $161 million   primarily due to lower earnings.

Operating Statistics   (Estimated)         

  Certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle. 
    
  Key Performance Measures Definitions 
  FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index   - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. 
  FRA Train Accident Rate   - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles. 
  On-Time Originations   - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule. 
  On-Time Arrivals   - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains). 
  Train Velocity   - Average train speed between terminals in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). 
  Dwell   - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard.  It does not include cars moving through the yard on the same train.  
  Cars-On-Line   - An average count of all cars on the network (does not include locomotives, cabooses, trailers, containers or maintenance equipment).  
    
    The Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, innovation and investment. CSX's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on the latest tools, programs and employee participation that are designed to continuously strengthen the safety culture. Increased investment in training and technology  also is designed to allow CSX employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents.  The Company's safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. 
    
  Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. CSX has established formal relationships with industry groups, leading universities and suppliers to develop, implement and deploy the latest technology that can detect infrastructure problems before they happen. To illustrate, through a waiver granted by the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), CSX is using advanced continuous rail testing methods that are being adopted by other railroads as the system s value is proven.  
       
  The Company constantly collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on safety innovations and initiatives. For example, CSX and other freight railroads have actively worked with the U.S. Department of Transportation and other key stakeholders to evaluate and implement far-reaching safety enhancements for transportation of certain flammable materials, including essential energy products, on the nation s freight railroad network.

  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

CSX s FRA reportable personal injury frequency index of 1.23 for the quarter was 16 percent unfavorable as a reduction in the number of injuries was more than offset by a significant decline in man-hours due to fewer employees. The FRA train accident frequency rate of 2.22 for the quarter improved 23 percent from the prior year.  The Company remains committed to ongoing improvement, with a focus on avoiding catastrophic events. 
    
    CSX s operating performance in the third quarter was improved versus last year and stable sequentially. On-time originations were 84 percent, an 11 percent improvement year-over-year, and on-time arrivals increased 19 percent, to 64 percent. Average train velocity of 20.8 miles per hour and terminal dwell of 25.6 hours remained stable when compared to the prior year.  The Company expects to sustain or improve this level of performance while continuing to drive productivity and resource efficiency.       

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
  The following are material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and sources of liquidity and capital, which provide an update to the discussion included in CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Material Changes in Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows 
  Consolidated Balance Sheets  
  Total assets   decreased     $64 million   from prior year due to net cash outflows, including short-term investment activity, of $683 million partially offset by the increase in net properties of $608 million. Total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined decreased $64 million from year end due to $307 million repayment of seller-financed assets and lower pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities of $36 million, offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $326 million. 
    
  Significant Cash Flows  
  The following chart highlights net cash activity of $25 million as compared to $128 million for operating, investing and financing activities for   nine   months ended   2016   and   2015  .  

Cash provided by operating activities   decreased     $24 million   driven by voluntary contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans and working capital activities, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. 

Cash used in investing activities declined   $1,058 million   primarily driven by lower purchases of short-term investments and lower property additions. 

Cash used in financing activities increased   $931 million   due to lower net debt issued, the repayment of seller-financed assets and higher share repurchases.

  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Projected capital investments for 2016 are expected to be $2.7 billion, including approximately $300 million for Positive Train Control ("PTC").  This $2.7 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in the year the reimbursement obligation arises. Of the 2016 investment, approximately 40 percent will be used to sustain the core infrastructure.  The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return projects supporting long-term profitable growth, productivity initiatives and service improvements.  CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. 
    
  The Company has incurred significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC and has substantial work ahead.  CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately   $2.2 billion  . This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies.  Total PTC spending through   September 2016   was   $1.7 billion  .  
    
  Liquidity and Working Capital 
  As of the end of   third   quarter   2016  , CSX had   $755 million   of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  CSX has a   $1 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks.  This facility expires in   May 2020   and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock and dividends to shareholders.  See Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements. 
    
  Subsequent to the third quarter, on September 28, 2016, the Company renewed and modified its existing receivables securitization facility. The facility was to expire in June 2017 and is now extended with a similar   three  -year term scheduled to expire in   September 2019  . It was also modified to provide liquidity of up to   $200 million  , changed from $250 million, along with modifications to other terms. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. As of the date of this filing, the Company has   no   outstanding balances under this facility. 
    
  Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital   deficit   of $  100 million   and surplus of $  888 million   as of   September 23, 2016   and   December 25, 2015  , respectively.  This large change since year-end in working capital of $988 million relates to cash used for property additions of   $1,590 million  , share repurchases of   $778 million   and dividends of   $513 million   more than offsetting cash generated from operations of   $2,488 million  .  Also, debt due in the next 12 months increased $611 million.  
    
  The Company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above.  The Company continues to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due.  Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations.  The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis.  Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the areas below.  For further discussion of CSX's critical accounting estimates, see the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.   

casualty, environmental and legal reserves; 
                
    pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;  
                
    depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and 
                
    income taxes.

    expectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives; 
                
    expectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; 
                
    management's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, safety and service performance, proposed new services and other matters that are not historical facts, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; and

    natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property or equipment; 
                
    competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking and competition and consolidation or financial distress within the transportation industry generally;  
                
    the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations (including those associated with PTC implementation), as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations; 
                
    the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes; 
                
    unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases;  
                
    changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;

    changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and 
                
    the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions. 
     Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at   www.sec.gov   and the Company's website at   www.csx.com  .

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided under Part II, Item 7A (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk) of CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  As of   September 23, 2016  , under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of   September 23, 2016  , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in CSX's periodic SEC reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

  Environmental Proceedings That Could Result in Fines Above $100,000 
  In connection with a CSXT train derailment in Mount Carbon, West Virginia in February 2015, the Company has entered into discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concerning a regulatory penalty related to a release of product into the environment. Although final resolution of this matter is subject to further discussions and potential litigation, the Company does not believe that the outcome will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

  PART II 

Item 2.  CSX Purchases of Equity Securities 
   CSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: (1) to further its goals under its share repurchase program and (2) to fund the Company s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees.   
    
  In April 2015, the Company announced a new   $2 billion   share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2017.  During the   third   quarter of   2016   , the Company repurchased approximately   $263 million  , or   ten million   shares. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.  In accordance with the   Equity Topic   in the ASC, the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. Generally, retained earnings are only impacted by net earnings and dividends.     
       
  Share repurchase activity for the   third   quarter   2016   was as follows: 

(a) Third quarter 2016 consisted of the following fiscal periods: July (June 25, 2016 - July 22, 2016), August (July 23, 2016 - August 19, 2016), September (August 20, 2016 - September 23, 2016). 
  (b) The difference of   107,395   shares between the "Total Number of Shares Purchased" and the "Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs" for the quarter represents shares purchased to fund the Company's contribution to a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees.

INTRODUCTION 
  The CSX Executives  Deferred Compensation Plan is originally effective January 1, 2005.  The Plan provides certain executives with an opportunity to defer the receipt of a portion of their salary, award(s) under various incentive compensation plans and programs of CSX Corporation and its Affiliated Companies and/or other qualifying compensation that may be offered from time to time. 
  The Plan is unfunded and is maintained by CSX Corporation and its Affiliated Companies primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly-compensated employees.  The Plan is intended to be fully compliant with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the final regulations promulgated thereunder, taking into account any and all transition rules and relief promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding compliance therewith.  
  The Plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2017 to provide for the following: (i) to incorporate the previously executed Amendments #1-3 into the Plan document; (ii) to amend the definition of Eligible Executive to provide the Corporation additional flexibility in determining eligibility standards from year to year; (iii) to add Disability as an electable distribution event as permitted under Code Section 409A; (iv) to incorporate a Benefit Appeals Officer to oversee the claims appeal process under the Plan; (v) to add the ability to permit additional sources of compensation to be deferrable under the Plan; (vi) to add the ability to grant discretionary company contributions at the sole discretion of the Corporation and attach a vesting schedule with respect thereto; and (vii) make additional clarifications of existing provisions.

  8.07.        Status of Account Pending Distribution. 
  (a)        Pending distribution, a Member s Cash Account shall continue to be credited with earnings and losses as provided in Section 7.02.

  8.08.        Re-deferral Elections.

   Affected Members  will receive distributions of any undistributed benefits of his/her entire Cash and Stock Account balance in a lump sum within thirty days (30) days of a Change of Control.   
  For purposes of this Section 8.09, an Affected Member is any service provider or former service provider as to which there is a Change of Control relating to:  (i) the corporation for which such Member is providing services at the time of a Change of Control; (ii) a corporation which is liable for such payments to the extent of the services provided to such corporation or corporations by the Member or there is a bona fide business purpose for such corporation or corporations to be liable for such payments other than avoidance of Federal income tax; or (iii) a corporation which is a majority shareholder of a corporation identified in (i) or (ii) above or any corporation in a chain of corporations in which each corporation is a majority shareholder of another corporation in the chain, ending in a corporation identified in (i) or (ii) above.

   23 

9.03.        Installments and Withdrawals Pro-Rata.

ARTICLE X      CLAIMS PROCEDURES 
  10.01.        Filing Claims. 
  Any Member or beneficiary entitled to benefits under the Plan may file a claim for benefits with the Administrator in accordance with Sections 10.02, 10.03 and 10.04.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims relating to Disability-related benefits shall be subject to Sections 10.05, 10.06 and 10.07 and supersede the provisions in Sections 10.02, 10.03 and 10.04.  
  10.02.        Notification to Claimant (General). 
  If a claim is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator will furnish written or electronic (in accordance with DOL Regs.   2520.104b-1(c)) notification of the decision to the claimant within ninety (90) days of receipt of the claim in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.  Such notification shall contain the following information:  
  (a)        the specific reason or reasons for the denial; 
  (b)        specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based;

  (d)        a description of the Plan s claims review procedures describing the steps to be taken and the applicable time limits to submit claims for review, including a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA section 502(a) following an adverse benefit determination on review. 
  If special circumstances require an extension of time for the Administrator to process the claim, the 90-day period may be extended for an additional 90 days.  Prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period, the claimant shall be furnished with a written or electronic notice setting forth the reason for the extension.  The notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Administrator expects to render the benefit determination. 
  10.03.        Review Procedure (General). 
  A claimant or his authorized representative may, with respect to any denied claim:  
  (a)        request a full and fair review upon a written application filed within sixty (60) days after receipt by the claimant of written or electronic notification of the denial of his claim; 
  (b)        submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits; and 
  (c)        upon request, and free of charge, be provided reasonable access to and copies of documents and records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits. 
  
   25 

The Benefit Appeals Officer shall provide claimant a review taking into account all comments, documents, records, and information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.  If the claimant (or his duly authorized representative) fails to appeal such action to the Benefit Appeals Officer in writing within the prescribed period of time, the Administrator s adverse determination shall be final, binding, and conclusive. 
  Any request or submission must be in writing and directed to the Benefit Appeals Officer.  The Benefit Appeals Officer will have the sole responsibility for the review of any denied claim and will take all steps appropriate in the light of the findings.  
  10.04.        Decision on Review (General). 
  The Benefit Appeals Officer will render a decision upon review no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the request for a claim review.  If special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing on any matter pertaining to the denied claim) warrant additional time, the decision will be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review.  Written notice specifying the circumstances requiring an extension will be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension.  The decision on review will be in writing and will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based.  If the decision on review is not furnished to the claimant within the time limits prescribed above, the claim will be deemed denied on review. 
  10.05.        Notification to Claimant (Disability Benefits). 
  If a claim relating to a Disability benefit is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator will furnish written or electronic (in accordance with DOL Regs.   2520.104b-1(c)) notification of the decision to the claimant within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the claim in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.   A notification of denial of Disability benefits shall contain the following information:  
    
  (a)        the specific reason or reasons for the denial; 
  (b)        specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based; 
  (c)        a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and  
  (d)        a description of the Plan s claims review procedures describing the steps to be taken and the applicable time limits to submit claims for review, including a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA section 502(a) following an adverse benefit determination on review. 
  If the Administrator determines that it needs additional time to review the Disability claim, the Administrator will provide the claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 45-day period. If the Administrator determines that a decision cannot be made within the first extension period due to matters beyond the control of the Administrator, the time period for making a determination may be further extended for an additional 30 days. If such an additional extension is necessary, the Administrator shall notify the claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day extension. Any notice  
  
   26 

of extension shall indicate the circumstances necessitating the extension of time, the date by which the Administrator expects to furnish a notice of decision, the specific standards on which such entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim and any additional information needed to resolve those issues. A claimant will be provided a minimum of 45 days to submit any necessary additional information to the Administrator. In the event that a 30-day extension is necessary due to a claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for furnishing a notice of decision shall be tolled from the date on which the notice of the extension is sent to the claimant until the earlier of the date the claimant responds to the request for additional information or the response deadline. 
  10.06.        Review Procedure (Disability Benefits). 
  A claimant or his authorized representative may, with respect to any denied claim:  
  (a)        request a full and fair review upon a written application filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after receipt by the claimant of written or electronic notification of the denial of his claim; 
  (b)        submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits; and 
  (c)        upon request, and free of charge, be provided reasonable access to and copies of documents and records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits. 
  The Benefit Appeals Officer shall provide claimant a review taking into account all comments, documents, records, and information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.  If the claimant (or his duly authorized representative) fails to appeal such action to the Benefit Appeals Officer in writing within the prescribed period of time, the Administrator s adverse determination shall be final, binding, and conclusive. 
  Any request or submission must be in writing and directed to the Benefit Appeals Officer.  The Benefit Appeals Officer will have the sole responsibility for the review of any denied claim and will take all steps appropriate in the light of its findings.  
  10.07.        Decision on Review (Disability Benefits). 
  The review shall be conducted by the Benefit Appeals Officer. In reviewing the appeal, the Benefit Appeals Officer shall: (i) not afford deference to the initial denial of the claim, (ii) consult a medical professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine relating to the claimant s disability and who was neither consulted as part of the initial denial nor is the subordinate of such individual, and (iii) identify the medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained with respect to the initial benefit denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the decision. The Benefit Appeals Officer shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 45 days following receipt of the appeal (or within 90 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Benefit Appeals Officer expects to render the determination on review. Following its review of any additional information submitted by the claimant, the Benefit Appeals Officer shall render a decision  
  
   27 

on its review of the denied claim.  The decision on review will be in writing and will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based.

29 

ARTICLE VII      GENERAL PROVISIONS 
  12.01.        No Funding. 
  Nothing contained in this Plan or in a Deferral Agreement shall cause this Plan to be a funded retirement plan.

Neither the Member, his or her beneficiary, contingent beneficiaries, heirs or personal representatives shall have any right, title or interest in or to any funds of any Trust or the Affiliated Companies on account of this Plan or on account of having completed a Deferral Agreement.  The assets held in any Trust shall be subject to the claims of creditors of the applicable Affiliated Companies, and the Trust s assets shall be used to discharge said claims in the event of the applicable Affiliated Companies  insolvency.  Each Member shall have the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Affiliated Companies and this Plan constitutes a mere promise by the applicable Affiliated Companies to make benefit payments in the future.

  To the extent reflected by resolutions of the applicable boards of directors, obligations for benefits payable by the applicable Affiliated Companies under this Plan shall be joint and several. 
  12.03.        No Contract of Employment. 
  The existence of this Plan or a Deferral Agreement does not constitute a contract for continued employment between an Eligible Executive or a Member and an Affiliated Company.  The Affiliated Companies reserve the right to modify an Eligible Executive s or Member s remuneration and to terminate an Eligible Executive or a Member for any reason and at any time, notwithstanding the existence of this Plan or a Deferral Agreement. 
  12.04.        Taxes. 
  All applicable FICA, RRTA or other employment taxes due on deferrals under this Plan shall be withheld from non-deferred salary, Awards, Alternative Compensation or other earnings.

  Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the right to receive any benefit under this Plan may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or encumbered by a Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary in any manner and any attempt to do so shall be void.  No such benefit shall be subject to garnishment, attachment or other legal or equitable process without the prior written consent of the Affiliated Companies.

  (b)        The Administrator shall have sole and absolute discretion to interpret the Plan, determine eligibility for and benefits due hereunder.  Decisions of the Administrator regarding benefits under the Plan shall at all times be binding and conclusive on Members, their beneficiaries, heirs and assigns. 
  (c)        Prior to paying any benefit under this Plan, the Administrator may require the Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary to provide such information or material as the Administrator, in the Administrator s sole discretion, shall deem necessary for the Administrator to make any determination it may be required to make under this Plan.  The Administrator may withhold payment of any benefit under this Plan until the Administrator receives all such information and material and is reasonably satisfied of its correctness and genuineness.  The Administrator shall provide adequate notice in writing to any Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary whose claim for benefits under this Plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial.  A reasonable opportunity shall be afforded to any such Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary for a full and fair review by the Administrator of the Administrator s decision denying the claim.  The Administrator s decision on any such review shall be final and binding on the Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary and all other interested persons.  All acts and decisions of the Administrator shall be final and binding upon all Members, beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries and employees of the Affiliated Companies. 
  (d)        The  Administrator in its sole discretion and upon such terms as it may prescribe, may permit any company or corporation directly or indirectly controlled by the Corporation to participate in the Plan. 
  (e)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the following decisions and actions by the Corporation or the Administrator under the Plan shall be made and carried out only with prior notice to the Compensation Committee: 
  (i)        designation of any compensation as a new Award type eligible for deferral under Section 10.7 or as Alternative Compensation under Section 1.04 or the establishment or change of the maximum amount of such Award types or Alternative Compensation that may be deferred under the Plan, in each case for a Section 16 person, as determined by the Corporation; and

   31 

12.07.        Impact of Future Legislation or Regulation. 
  (a)        This Section 12.07 shall become operative upon the enactment of any change in applicable statutory law or the promulgation by the Internal Revenue Service of a final regulation or other pronouncement having the force of law, which statutory law, as changed, or final regulation or pronouncement, as promulgated, would cause any Member to include in his or her federal gross income amounts accrued by the Member under the Plan on a date (an  Early Taxation Event ) prior to the date on which such amounts are made available to him or her hereunder. 
  (b)        Notwithstanding any other Section of this Plan to the contrary (but subject to subsection (c) below, as of an Early Taxation Event, the feature or features of this Plan, or the election by a Member that would cause the Early Taxation Event shall be null and void, to the extent, and only to the extent, required to prevent the Member from being required to include in his or her federal gross income amounts accrued by the Member under the Plan prior to the date on which such amounts are made available to him hereunder.  If only a portion of a Member s Cash or Stock Account is impacted by the change in the law, then only such portion shall be subject to this Section, with the remainder of the Cash or Stock Account not so affected being subject to such rights and features as if the law were not changed.  If the law only impacts Members who have a certain status with respect to a Participating Company, then only such Members shall be subject to this Section. 
  (c)        Notwithstanding Section 12.07(b) above, if an Early Termination Event occurs, the amount that is required to be included in income, as a result of a compliance failure under Code   409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder, shall be distributed to the affected Member as soon as practicable following such Early Taxation Event. 
  (d)        Notwithstanding Sections 12.04 and 12.07(b) above, if an Early Taxation Event occurs, to the extent an amount is includable in income as a result of a compliance failure under Code   409A or otherwise before such amount is distributable under the Plan, an amount equal to the total employment taxes on the Early Taxation Event and any applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax withholding attributable to the payment of such amounts required to be withheld or paid and the income taxes required to be withheld thereon, shall be distributed to the affected Member or paid to the appropriate taxing authority as soon as practicable following such Early Taxation Event in accordance with Code   409A 
  12.08.        Construction. 
  (a)        The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded deferred compensation arrangement for a select group of management or highly compensated employees and all rights hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida to the extent not preempted by federal law. 
  (b)        The masculine pronoun means the feminine wherever appropriate. 
  (c)        The captions inserted herein are inserted as a matter of convenience and shall not affect the construction of the Plan.

  I, Michael J. Ward, certify that:  
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of CSX Corporation;  
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

           b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

           5.
