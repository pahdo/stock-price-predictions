iShares   Silver   Trust   
    Notes to Financial      Statements   (Unaudited)   
   September 30, 2016   
     
   1   - Organization   
     
  The iShares Silver Trust (the  Trust ) was organized on April 21, 2006 as a New York trust. The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon (the  Trustee ), which is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust. The Trust s sponsor is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Sponsor ). The Trust is governed by the First Amended and Restated Depositary Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) executed by the Trustee and the Sponsor as of February 28, 2013. The Trust issues units of beneficial interest (or  Shares ) representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets.  
     
  The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide a vehicle for investors to make an investment similar to an investment in silver.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Trust s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.  
     
  The Trust qualifies as an investment company solely for accounting purposes and not for any other purpose and follows the accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies , but is not registered, and is not required to be registered, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  
     
   2 - Significant Accounting Policies   

A.    
 
     Basis of Accounting        
     
  The following significant accounting policies are consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
     
  Certain statements and captions in the financial statements for the prior year have been changed to conform to the current financial statement presentation.  

B.    
 
         Silver Bullion        
     
  JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London branch (the  Custodian ), is responsible for the safekeeping of silver bullion owned by the Trust.  
     
  Fair value of the silver bullion is based on the price per ounce of silver determined by the CME Group Inc. at approximately 12:00 p.m. (London time) and announced by Thomson Reuters shortly thereafter on each day that the London silver market is open for business ( LBMA Silver Price ).    
     
  Gain or loss on sales of silver bullion is calculated on a trade date basis using the average cost method.

The following tables summarize activity in silver bullion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (all balances in 000 s):  

The following tables summarize activity in silver bullion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (all balances in 000 s):  

C.    
 
     Calculation of Net Asset Value        
     
  On each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the net asset value of the Trust is obtained by subtracting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the fair value of the silver and other assets held by the Trust. The Trustee computes the net asset value per Share by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made.

Table of Contents 

D.    
 
     Offering of the Shares        
     
  Trust Shares are issued and redeemed continuously in aggregations of 50,000 Shares in exchange for silver bullion rather than cash. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. The Trust only transacts with registered broker-dealers that are eligible to settle securities transactions through the book-entry facilities of the Depository Trust Company and that have entered into a contractual arrangement with the Trust and the Sponsor governing, among other matters, the creation and redemption of Shares (such broker-dealers, the  Authorized Participants ). Holders of Shares of the Trust may redeem their Shares at any time acting through an Authorized Participant and in the prescribed aggregations of 50,000 Shares   provided , that redemptions of Shares may be suspended during any period while regular trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca ) is suspended or restricted, or in which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of silver is not reasonably practicable.  
     
  The per Share amount of silver exchanged for a purchase or redemption represents the per Share amount of silver held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities. The Trustee calculates the silver amount in respect of any liabilities of the Trust daily using the LBMA Silver Price.   
     
  When silver bullion is exchanged in settlement of a redemption, it is considered a sale of silver bullion for accounting purposes.  

E.    
 
         Federal Income Taxes        
     
  The Trust is treated as a  grantor trust  for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. Any interest, expenses, gains and losses are  passed through  to the holders of Shares of the Trust.  
     
  The Sponsor has reviewed the tax positions as of September 30, 2016 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust s financial statements.  
     
   3   - Trust Expenses   
     
  The Trust pays to the Sponsor a Sponsor s fee that accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.50% of the net asset value of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s fee, the Custodian s fee, NYSE Arca listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses, and up to $100,000 per annum in legal fees and expenses.  
     
   4 - Related Parties   
     
  The Sponsor and the Trustee are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee s fee is paid by the Sponsor and is not a separate expense of the Trust.  
     
   5 - Indemnification   
     
  The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, or expense arising out of or in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Trust Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement.  
     
  The Trust has agreed to indemnify the Custodian for any loss incurred in connection with the custodian agreement, other than losses due to the Custodian s negligence, fraud or willful default.  
     
   6 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities   
     
  In the normal course of business, the Trust may enter into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.  
     
   7 - Concentration Risk   
     
  Substantially all of the Trust s assets are holdings of silver bullion, which creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of silver. Accordingly, a decline in the price of silver will have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares of the Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of silver include a change in economic conditions (such as a recession), an increase in the hedging activities of silver producers, and changes in the attitude of speculators, investors and other market participants towards silver.

(c)   
 
  Based on the change in net asset value of a Share during the period.     

(d)   
 
  Percentage is not annualized.     

(e)   
 
  Percentage is annualized.     
          
   9 - Investment Valuation   
     
  U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trust s policy is to value its investment at fair value.  
     
  Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities. Inputs may be based on independent market data ( observable inputs ) or they may be internally developed ( unobservable inputs ). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  
     
  Level 1    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
     
  Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and  
     
  Level 3    Unobservable inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the value of the silver bullion held by the Trust is categorized as Level 1.

   Introduction   
     
  The iShares Silver Trust (the  Trust ) is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the  Trustee ) acting as trustee pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Depositary Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) between the Trustee and iShares   Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, the sponsor of the Trust (the  Sponsor ). The Trust issues units of beneficial interest (or  Shares ) representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of silver bullion held by a custodian as an agent of the Trust responsible only to the Trustee.  
     
  The Trust is a passive investment vehicle and seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of silver.  
     
  The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for silver, only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares or integral multiples thereof (each, a  Basket ), and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers that have previously entered into an agreement with the Trust governing the terms and conditions of such issuance (such broker-dealers, the  Authorized Participants ). A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee.  
     
  Shares of the Trust trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. under the symbol  SLV.   
     
   Valuation of   Silver; Computation of Net Asset Value   
     
  On each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the silver held by the Trust and determines the net asset value of the Trust and the net asset value per Share. The Trustee values the silver held by the Trust using the price per ounce of silver determined by the CME Group Inc. at approximately 12:00 p.m. (London time) and announced by Thomson Reuters shortly thereafter on each day that the London silver market is open for business ( LBMA Silver Price ). Having valued the silver held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the fair value of the silver and other assets held by the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes the net asset value per Share by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made.   
     
   Liquidity   
     
  The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its sales of silver.   
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. Below, the Trust describes the valuation of silver bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding its results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies.  
     
   Valuation of   Silver Bullion   
     
  There are other indicators of the value of silver bullion that are available that could be different than that chosen by the Trust. The LBMA Silver Price is used by the Trust because it is commonly used by the U.S. silver market as an indicator of the value of silver, and is permitted to be used under the Trust Agreement. The use of an indicator of the value of silver bullion other than the LBMA Silver Price could result in materially different fair value pricing of the silver held by the Trust.

Results of Operations   
     
   The Quarter Ended   September 30, 2016   
     
  The Trust s net asset value grew from $6,121,522,719 at June 30, 2016 to $7,008,425,684 at September 30, 2016, a 14.49% increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 350,800,000 Shares at June 30, 2016 to 381,550,000 Shares at September 30, 2016, a consequence of 36,750,000 Shares (735 Baskets) being created and 6,000,000 Shares (120 Baskets) being redeemed during the quarter. The Trust s net asset value also benefited from an increase in the LBMA Silver Price, which rose 5.39% from $18.36 at June 30, 2016 to $19.35 at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The 5.27% increase in the Trust s net asset value per Share from $17.45 at June 30, 2016 to $18.37 at September 30, 2016 is directly related to the 5.39% increase in the LBMA Silver Price.  
     
  The Trust s net asset value per Share increased slightly less than the price of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fees, which were $8,678,646 for the quarter, or 0.13% of the Trust s average weighted assets of $6,914,798,284 during the quarter. The net asset value per Share of $19.68 on August 2, 2016 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low during the quarter of $17.57 on August 25, 2016.   
     
  Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $311,697,420, resulting primarily from an unrealized gain on investment in silver bullion of $315,993,046, a net realized gain of $3,976,078 on silver bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares and a net realized gain of $406,942 from silver bullion sold to pay expenses. These were offset by a net investment loss of $8,678,646. Other than the Sponsor s fees of $8,678,646, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter.  
     
   The   Nine Months September 30, 2016   
     
  The Trust s net asset value grew from $4,391,943,604 at December 31, 2015 to $7,008,425,684 at September 30, 2016, a 59.57% increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the LBMA Silver Price, which rose 40.01% from $13.82 at December 31, 2015 to $19.35 at September 30, 2016. The Trust's net asset value also benefited from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 333,550,000 Shares at December 31, 2015 to 381,550,000 Shares at September 30, 2016, a consequence of 87,150,000 Shares (1,743 Baskets) being created and 39,150,000 Shares (783 Baskets) being redeemed during the period.  
     
  The 39.48% increase in the Trust s net asset value per Share from $13.17 at December 31, 2015 to $18.37 at September 30, 2016 is directly related to the 40.01% increase in the LBMA Silver Price.  
     
  The Trust s net asset value per Share increased slightly less than the price of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fees, which were $21,513,052 for the period, or 0.37% of the Trust s average weighted assets of $5,756,920,959 during the period. The net asset value per Share of $19.68 on August 2, 2016 was the highest during the period, compared with a low during the period of $12.93 on January 28, 2016.   
     
  Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,789,311,103, resulting primarily from an unrealized gain on investment in silver bullion of $1,884,475,494, offset by a net investment loss of $21,513,052, a net realized loss of $2,227,967 from silver bullion sold to pay expenses and a net realized loss of $71,423,372 on silver bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares. Other than the Sponsor s fees of $21,513,052, the Trust had no expenses during the period.

  The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  
     
  There were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
