1.   
       Nature
    of Operations and Continuance of Business    

The
accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Pacific Green Technologies Inc. (the  Company )
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. In the opinion
of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a recurring nature considered
necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
periods shown.  

The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. The results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year.  

These
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the ability of the Company to
obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. As at September
30, 2016, the Company has not generated any revenues, has a working capital deficit of $10,717,376, and has an accumulated deficit
of $61,626,219 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.

    Accounting Policies    

(a)    Principles
                                         of Consolidation    

These
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. These condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and the following entities:  

Pacific
    Green Technologies Marine Limited (PGTML)  
         
      Wholly-owned
    subsidiary

    Green Technologies International Limited ( PGTIL )

(b)    Financial
                                         Instruments    

ASC
820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the
fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes
the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1   

Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2   

Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.  

Level
3   

Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

2.   
       Significant
    Accounting Policies  (continued)   

(b)  
      Financial
    Instruments (continued)   

The
Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, VAT receivable, amounts due from and to related parties, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, loan payable, convertible debentures, and note payable. With the exception of long-term note
payable, the recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature
and respective maturity dates or durations.  

The
following table represents assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value as of September 30, 2016, on
a recurring basis:  

During
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $333,308
(2015 - loss of $1,057,818).  

(c)  
      Reclassifications   

Certain
of the figures presented for comparative purposes have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current
period.  

(d)  
      Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements   

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation
of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which resulted in the reclassification
of debt issuance costs from  Other Assets  to inclusion as a reduction of the debt balance. The Company adopted ASU
2015-03 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, with full retrospective application as required by the guidance. The application
of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet or operations for any period presented.  

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements
and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.  

3.   
       Intangible
    Assets    

On
May 17, 2013, the Company entered into an Assignment of Assets agreement with EnviroTechnologies, Inc. ( Enviro ),
whereby the Company acquired various patents and technical information related to the manufacture of a wet scrubber for removing
sulphur, other pollutants, and the particulate matter from diesel engine exhaust. In exchange for these assets, the Company waived
all obligations owing to the Company as well as agreed to return a total of 88,876,443 of Enviro s shares back to Enviro.
The obligations waived consisted of $237,156 owing to the Company as well as $93,721 of debt owing to Pacific Green Group Limited
( PGG ), which was assigned to the Company. The Company entered into share exchange agreements with Enviro shareholders
in which it issued shares of its common stock in exchange for shares of Enviro on a one-for-ten basis. The intangible assets acquired
were recorded at cost and is being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 17 years.

       Loan
    Payable    

As
at September 30, 2016, PGTIL, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, owes $546,153 ( 419,586) (March 31, 2016 - $625,574
( 435,000)) to a director of the Company, which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.  

5.   
       Convertible
    Debentures    

(a)    On
                                         May 27, 2014, the Company entered into a $200,000 convertible debenture with a non-related
                                         party. Under the terms of the debenture, the amount is unsecured, bears interest at 10%
                                         per annum, and is due on May 27, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, should any portion
                                         of the loan remain outstanding past maturity, the interest rate will increase to 15%
                                         per annum. The note is convertible into shares of common stock 180 days after the date
                                         of issuance (November 27, 2014) until maturity at a conversion rate of 75% of the average
                                         closing bid prices of the Company s common stock for the 45 days ending one trading
                                         day prior to the date the conversion notice is sent by the holder to the Company.    

The
Company analyzed the conversion option under ASC 815,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
( ASC 815 ), and determined that the conversion feature should be classified as a liability and recorded at fair value
due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the conversion option. In accordance
with ASC 815, the Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $33,922. On November
27, 2014, the note became convertible resulting in the Company recording a derivative liability of $33,922 with a corresponding
adjustment to loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
had accreted $nil (2015 - $12,820) of the debt discount to interest expense. On May 4, 2015, the Company issued 1,058,317 shares
of common stock for the conversion of $200,000 of this debenture and $18,888 of accrued interest.  

(b)    On
                                         June 12, 2014, the Company entered into a $100,000 convertible debenture with a non-related
                                         party. Under the terms of the debenture, the amount is unsecured, bears interest at 10%
                                         per annum, and is due on June 12, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, should any portion
                                         of the loan remain outstanding past maturity, the interest rate will increase to 15%
                                         per annum. The note is convertible into shares of common stock 180 days after the date
                                         of issuance (December 12, 2014) until maturity at a conversion rate of 75% of the average
                                         closing bid prices of the Company s common stock for the 45 days ending one trading
                                         day prior to the date the conversion notice is sent by the holder to the Company.    

The
Company analyzed the conversion option under ASC 815, and determined that the conversion feature should be classified as a liability
and recorded at fair value due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the
conversion option. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion
feature of $9,793. On December 12, 2014, the note became convertible resulting in the Company recording a derivative liability
of $9,793 with a corresponding adjustment to loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities. During the six months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company had accreted $nil (2015 - $1,637) of the debt discount to interest expense. On May 13, 2015, the
Company issued 459,418 shares of common stock for the conversion of $100,000 of this debenture and $7,796 of accrued interest.  

(c)    On
                                         November 10, 2015, the Company entered into a $110,000 convertible debenture with a non-related
                                         party, in exchange for $100,000, net of $10,000 for legal fees which have been deferred
                                         and will be amortized over the term of the debenture. Under the terms of the debenture,
                                         the amount is unsecured, bears one-time guaranteed interest at 10%, and is due on November
                                         10, 2016. The note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company equal to
                                         the lower of: (a) $0.40 or (b) 60% of the lowest trading price of the Company s
                                         common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the date of conversion.
                                         As at September 30, 2016, the Company recorded accrued interest of $11,000 (March 31,
                                         2016 - $11,000), which has been included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Company analyzed the conversion option under ASC 815, and determined that the conversion feature should be classified as a liability
and recorded at fair value due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the
conversion option. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion
feature of $110,000. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had accreted $56,491 (2015 - $nil) of the debt
discount to interest expense. As at September 30, 2016, the carrying value of the debenture was $61,473 (March 31, 2016 - $4,982)
and the fair value of the derivative liability was $482,908 (March 31, 2016 - $816,216).

    Liabilities    

The
Company records the fair value of the conversion price of the convertible debentures disclosed in Note 5 in accordance with ASC
815. The fair value of the derivative liabilities was calculated using a binomial option pricing model. The fair value of the
derivative liabilities is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value
of derivative liabilities of $333,308 (2015 - loss of $1,057,818). As at September 30, 2016, the Company recorded derivative liabilities
of $482,908 (March 31, 2016 - $816,216).  

The
following inputs and assumptions were used to fair value the convertible debenture outstanding during the six months ended September

The
note payable will be repaid in instalments of $1,000,000 on the anniversary of the agreement beginning on June 12, 2013 with the
income earned under the terms of the Representation Agreement. If the Company is unable to meet the repayment schedule, PGG will
have the option to either roll over any unpaid portion to the following payment date or to convert the outstanding amount into
shares of the Company s stock. The note had been discounted at a market rate of 18% to arrive at the net present value of
$3,127,171 as at June 12, 2012. The note is unsecured and cannot itself be used by PGG to cause the Company to become insolvent.

                                         of the Company who has a significant influence in the Company's operations. The amount
                                         owing is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.    

(d)    As
                                         at September 30, 2016, the Company owed $4,383,768 (March 31, 2016   $4,862,555)
                                         to a company controlled by a shareholder of the Company who has a significant influence
                                         on the Company's operations. The amounts owing are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and
                                         due on demand. On July 20, 2015, the Company entered into a conversion agreement with
                                         this company, whereby up to $1,000,000 in outstanding amounts may be converted at a rate
                                         of $0.70 per share for a 12 month period between July 20, 2016 and July 20, 2017. The
                                         Company determined that the convertible debt contained no embedded beneficial conversion
                                         feature as the conversion price was the same as the fair market value of the Company s
                                         common stock on the date of issuance.

Corporate
History   

Our
company was incorporated in Delaware on March 10, 1994, under the name of Beta Acquisition Corp. In September 1995, we changed
our name to In-Sports International, Inc. In August 2002, we changed our name from In-Sports International, Inc. to ECash, Inc.
In 2007, due to limited financial resources, we discontinued our operations. Over the course of the last five years, we have sought
new business opportunities.  

On
June 13, 2012, we changed our name to Pacific Green Technologies Inc. and effected a reverse split of our common stock following
which we had 27,002 shares of common stock outstanding with $0.001 par value.  

Effective
December 4, 2012, we filed with the Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation, wherein
we increased our authorized share capital to 510,000,000 shares of stock as follows:  

The
increase of authorized capital was approved by our board of directors on July 1, 2012 and by a majority of our stockholders by
a resolution dated July 1, 2012.  

Effective
November 1, 2016, Mr. Jordan Starkman resigned as a Director and, if any, from all offices of our company. Mr. Starkman s
resignation was not the result of any disagreements with our company regarding our operations, policies, practices or otherwise.
Our board of directors now consists of Andrew Jolly, Alexander Shead and Neil Carmichael.

Historical
Business Overview   

On
May 1, 2010 we entered into a consulting agreement with Sichel Limited. Sichel has investigated new opportunities for us and has
subscribed for new shares of our company s common stock. The consulting agreement entitles Sichel to $20,000 per calendar
month. With an effective date of March 31, 2013, the consulting agreement, along with all amounts owed to Sichel, were assigned
to Pacific Green Group Limited (  PGG  ). As at December 31, 2014, we owed Sichel $nil and we owed PGG $5,223,110.
Pursuant to the terms of the consulting agreement, if we are unable to pay the monthly consulting fee, PGG may elect to be paid
in shares of stock, and if we are unable to make payments for more than six months in any 12 month period, PGG has the right to
appoint an officer or director to the board, which right has not been exercised at this time.  

New
Strategy   

Management,
assisted by PGG, has identified an opportunity to build a business focused on marketing, developing and acquiring technologies
designed to improve the environment by reducing pollution. To this end we entered into and closed an assignment and share transfer
agreement, on June 14, 2012, for the assignment of a representation agreement and the acquisition of a company involved in the
environmental technology industry.  

The
assignment and share transfer agreement provided for the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Pacific Green
Technologies Limited, formerly PGG s subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Additionally, PGG assigned to our company a ten year
exclusive worldwide representation agreement with EnviroTechnologies Inc., (formerly EnviroResolutions, Inc.), a Delaware corporation,
to market and sell EnviroTechnologies  current and future environmental technologies. The representation agreement entitles
PGG to a commission of 20% of all sales (net of taxes) generated by EnviroTechnologies. Pursuant to the terms of the assignment
and share transfer agreement, all rights and obligations under the representation agreement have been transferred to our company.
We currently anticipate that sales under the representation agreement will be our sole source of revenue for the foreseeable future.
We had intended to complete an acquisition of EnviroTechnologies, as this would have been a logical step in our development. However,
as discussed herein, we have settled with EnviroTechnologies as an alternative.  

Both
Sichel and PGG are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Hookipia Trust. PGG s wholly owned subsidiary was Pacific Green Technologies
Limited. As a result, we acquired Pacific Green Technologies Limited from PGG. Sichel is a significant shareholder of our company
and also provides us with consulting services. The sole director of Sichel is also the sole director of PGG. Further, PGG is a
significant shareholder of EnviroTechnologies.  

The
assignment and share transfer agreement closed on June 14, 2012 via the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock as well
as a $5,000,000 promissory note to PGG. We have consequently undertaken the operations of Pacific Green Technologies Limited and
PGG s obligations under the representation agreement.  

Full
consideration contemplated by the assignment and share transfer agreement was $25,000,000 satisfied through the issue of 5,000,000
new shares of our common stock at a price of $4 per share with the balance of $5,000,000 structured as a promissory note over
the next five years as follows:  

4  

Under
the terms of the promissory note, the loan repayments specified above shall not exceed the amount we earn under the terms of the
representation agreement. If we are unable to meet the repayment schedule set out above, PGG will have the option to either roll
over any unpaid portion to the following payment date or to convert the outstanding amount into new shares of our common stock.
However, the entire amount of the promissory note is due upon the maturity date on the fifth anniversary. The promissory note
is unsecured.  

The
total consideration of $25,000,000 was a purchase price not determined under U.S. GAAP, and both the $25,000,000 total price and
the deemed price of $4 per share does not represent the fair value of the stock issued or a value used in accounting for the acquisition.
The number of shares issued and the terms of the promissory note were negotiated between the parties and are intended to represent
full consideration for the acquisition of Pacific Green Technologies Limited and the representation agreement.  

Other
Business Matters   

Effective
December 18, 2012, we entered into a non-executive director agreement with Dr. Neil Carmichael, wherein Dr. Carmichael will receive
compensation of $1,000 per year for the term of the agreement and was granted options to purchase up to 62,500 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share of common stock. The options will terminate the earlier of 24 months, or upon the
termination of the agreement and Dr. Carmichael s engagement with our company. The director agreement and related options
are in the process of being renewed. As of the date of this quarterly report, the options issued to Dr. Carmichael have not been
exercised.

    per share of our capital stock in the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that PGEP secures sufficient financing
    for the construction of the facility, which has not yet occurred.

the respective number of shares of PGEP sold by each respective shareholder. On May 15, 2013, pursuant to the stock purchase agreement,
we issued an aggregate of 3,500,000 common shares, at an agreed upon deemed price of $4 per share, to the five shareholders.

On
May 17, 2013, we entered into a debt settlement agreement with EnviroTechnologies and EnviroResolutions (collectively, the   Debtors  ).
Pursuant to the terms of the debt settlement agreement, we agreed to release and waive all obligations of the Debtors to repay
debts, in the aggregate of $293,406 and CAD$38,079, to us and agreed to return an aggregate of 88,876,443 common shares of EnviroTechnologies
to EnviroResolutions. The 88,876,443 common shares of EnviroTechnologies were returned as of June 30, 2016. As consideration for
this release and waiver and return of shares, the Debtors agreed to transfer all rights, interests and title to certain intellectual
property, the physical embodiments of such intellectual property, and to the supplemental agreement dated March 5, 2013 among
EnviroResolutions, PREL and Green Energy Parks Limited (  GEPL  ) (collectively, the   Debtors 
Assets  ).  

The
Debtors  Assets include the intellectual property rights throughout most of the world for the  ENVI-Clean 
system, the ENVI-Pure  system and the ENVI-SEA  scrubber.  The ENVI-Clean  system removes most of
the sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the
combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels. The ENVI-Pure  emission system combines the
ENVI-Clean  highly effective patent-pending wet scrubbing technology with an innovative wet electrostatic precipitator and
a granular activated carbon adsorber to remove particulate matter, acid gases, regulated metals, dioxins and VOCs from the flue
gas to levels significantly below those required by strictest international regulations. The ENVI-SEA  scrubber can be applied
to diesel exhaust emissions that require sulphur and particulate matter abatement. Using seawater on a single-pass basis as the
scrubbing fluid in combination with its patent pending scrubbing head will provide a highly interactive zone of turbulent mixing
for absorption of SO 2 , particulate matter and other pollutants from the engine s exhaust.  

The
following is a brief description of further terms and conditions of the debt settlement agreement that are material to our company:

Results
of Operations   

The
following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Our
net loss for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:  

9  

Operating
expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were $527,654 as compared to $577,880 for the three month period
ended September 30, 2015. Consulting fees were comprised of fees paid to the director of our subsidiary, Pacific Green Technologies
Limited; professional fees were comprised of legal, audit and accounting costs. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily
attributed to decreases in consulting fees, stock-based compensation, and transfer agent and filing fees.   

Operating
expenses for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 were $1,218,740 as compared to $1,082,421 for the six month period
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributed to increases in consulting fees, engineering
fees, office and miscellaneous, and professional fees.  

For
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, our company had a net loss of $757,020 ($0.03 per share) compared to a net loss
of $871,318 ($0.05per share) for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. In addition to the operating expenses noted

expense of $293,438 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.

of $2,752,415 ($0.15 per share) for the six month period ended September 30, 2015. For the six month period ended September 30,

liabilities of $333,308 compared to a loss of $1,057,818 in the comparative period.     

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Working
Capital   

Cash
Flows   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $397,277 in cash, $484,540 in total current assets, $11,201,916 in total current liabilities and
a working capital deficit of $10,717,376. As of March 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $11,164,685.  

We
are dependent on funds raised through debt/equity financing and proceeds from shareholder loans.  

10  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we spent $1,080,514 on operating activities, whereas $334,187 was spent on operating
activities for the six month period ended September 30, 2015.  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we used $25,784 on investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment, whereas
we received $50,064 in investing activities for the six month period ended September 30, 2015.  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we received $1,561,569 from financing activities, which consisted of $1,880,500 in proceeds
from share subscriptions received offset by $298,931 in repayments to related parties and $20,000 of loan payable, whereas we
received $525,429 from financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2015 which consisted of $650,000 in proceeds
from share subscriptions received and $15,573 from related parties offset by $140,144 in repayments to related parties.  

Anticipated
Cash Requirements   

We
will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through, equity
financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.  

We
anticipate that our cash expenses over the next 12 months (beginning July 2016) will be approximately $825,000 as described in
the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to
raise capital from our shareholders or other sources.  

Our
general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of transfer agent fees, bank and interest charges and
general office expenses. The professional fees are related to our regulatory filings throughout the year and include legal, accounting
and auditing fees.  

Based
on our planned expenditures, we will require approximately $825,000 to proceed with our business plan over the next 12 months.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $150,668 cash on hand. If we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require, we will
not be able to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on
our available financial resources.  

We
intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months from private placements, shareholder loans or possibly
a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer). If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money
through such efforts, we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. At this time we do not have a commitment
from any broker-dealer to provide us with financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available,
on terms that will be acceptable to us.  

Even
though we plan to raise capital through equity or debt financing, we believe that the latter may not be a viable alternative for
funding our operations as we do not have sufficient tangible assets to secure any such financing. We anticipate that any additional
funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any financing arranged
and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds from the sale of our common stock to finance
our operations. In the absence of such financing, we may be forced to abandon our business plan.  

11  

Going
Concern   

Our
consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis and
contain an additional explanatory paragraph which identifies issues that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The
continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and note
holders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately the attainment
of profitable operations. As at September 30, 2016, our company has not generated any revenues, has a working capital deficit
of $10,717,376, and has an accumulated deficit of $61,626,219 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding
our company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern.    

If
our operations and cash flow improve, management believes that we can continue to operate. However, no assurance can be given
that management s actions will result in profitable operations or an improvement in our liquidity situation. The threat
of our ability to continue as a going concern will cease to exist only when our revenues have reached a level able to sustain
our business operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to stockholders.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Our company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of intangible
assets, valuation of note payable, fair value of convertible debentures, fair value of derivative liabilities, fair value of stock-based
compensation, impairment of goodwill, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our company bases its estimates and
assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of
costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ
materially and adversely from our company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates
and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.  

Intangible
Assets   

Intangible
assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of patents. The patents are amortized straight-line
over the estimated useful life of 17 years.  

12  

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets   

Our
company reviews long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected
undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of the asset.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Our
company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , using
the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments
are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable.  

Our
company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected
by our company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables
include, but are not limited to our company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest
is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation
of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which resulted in the reclassification
of debt issuance costs from  Other Assets  to inclusion as a reduction of the debt balance. The Company adopted ASU
2015-03 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, with full retrospective application as required by the guidance. The application
of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet or operations for any period presented.  

Our
company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements
and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.
