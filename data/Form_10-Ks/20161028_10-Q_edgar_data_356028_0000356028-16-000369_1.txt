PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  CA, Inc.: 
  We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of CA, Inc. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three-month and six-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These condensed consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
  We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
  Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of CA, Inc. and subsidiaries as of   March 31, 2016  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated May 12, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   March 31, 2016  , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE A   ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation:   The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of CA, Inc. (Company) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 270, for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   (  2016   Form 10-K). 
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. 
  Operating results for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   March 31, 2017  . 
  Divestitures:   In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company sold its CA ERwin Data Modeling solution assets (ERwin). The results of operations associated with this business have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2015   and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents:   The Company s cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with approximately   83%   being held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries outside the United States at   September 30, 2016  . 
  New Accounting Pronouncements:   In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which creates new ASC Topic 606 (Topic 606) that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. In March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued additional amendments to     the technical guidance of Topic 606. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new standard will be effective for the Company s first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early application for fiscal year 2018 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Topic 606 is expected to have a significant effect on the Company s revenue recognition policies and disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect the standard will have on its ongoing financial reporting. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02),   Leases   (Topic 842), which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 will replace most existing lease accounting guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or     operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and requires the modified retrospective method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Although the Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09),   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (Topic 718), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company s first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine the adoption methods and the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

     Table of Contents  
  CA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 (ASU 2016-15),   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (Topic 230), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the Company s first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and requires a retrospective transition method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16 (ASU 2016-16),   Intra-Equity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   (Topic 740), which is intended to eliminate diversity in practice and provide a more accurate depiction of the tax consequences on intercompany asset transfers (excluding inventory). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to immediately recognize the tax consequences on intercompany asset transfers (excluding inventory) at the transaction date, rather than deferring the tax consequences under current GAAP. ASU 2016-16 will be effective for the Company s first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and requires a modified retrospective method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted, but only in the first quarter of an entity s annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-16 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

NOTE B   ACQUISITIONS 
  On July 8, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Rally Software Development Corp. (Rally), a provider of Agile development software and services. The acquisition of Rally broadens the Company s solution set and capabilities to better serve customers in the application economy. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement and related tender offer, the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding shares of Rally common stock for approximately   $519 million  . The purchase price allocation for Rally is provided in the table below. 
  The purchase price allocation for the Company s other acquisitions during fiscal year 2016, including the second quarter acquisition of Xceedium, Inc. (Xceedium), is included within the  Other Fiscal Year 2016 Acquisitions  column below. The acquisition of Xceedium and the Company s other acquisitions during fiscal year 2016 were immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate.   

           (1) 
    Includes customer relationships and trade names. 
              (2) 
    Includes approximately   $13 million   of cash acquired and approximately   $48 million   of short-term investments acquired relating to Rally. 
     The allocation of purchase price to acquired identifiable assets, including intangible assets, for Rally was finalized during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The excess purchase price over the estimated value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded to goodwill. The allocation of purchase price to goodwill was predominantly due to synergies the Company expects to achieve through integration of the acquired technology with the Company s existing product portfolio and the intangible assets that are not separable, such as assembled workforce and going concern. The goodwill relating to the Company s fiscal year 2016 acquisitions was not deductible for tax purposes and was allocated to the Enterprise Solutions segment. The pro forma effects of the Company s fiscal year 2016 acquisitions on the Company s revenues and results of operations during fiscal year 2016 were considered immaterial. 
  Transaction costs for the Company s fiscal year 2016 acquisitions, which were primarily included in  General and administrative  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, were   $17 million   and   $20 million   for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  Since Rally and Xceedium were acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six months ended September 30, 2015 included three months of activity for revenue and expenses associated with these acquisitions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations included total revenue of   $35 million   and net loss of   $5 million   for the Company s fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium.

Based on the capitalized software and other intangible assets recorded through   September 30, 2016  , the projected annual amortization expense for fiscal year   2017   and the next four fiscal years is expected to be as follows:   

  The Company evaluates the useful lives and recoverability of capitalized software and other intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. These evaluations require complex assumptions about key factors such as future customer demand, technology trends and the impact of those factors on the technology the Company acquires and develops for its products. Impairments or revisions to useful lives could result from the use of alternative assumptions that reflect reasonably possible outcomes related to future customer demand or technology trends for assets within the Enterprise Solutions segment. 
  Goodwill activity by segment for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was as follows:

NOTE F   DERIVATIVES 
  The Company is exposed to financial market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Changes in interest rates could affect the Company s monetary assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange rate changes could affect the Company s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions. The Company enters into derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating a portion of these risks. 
  Foreign Currency Contracts:   The Company enters into foreign currency option and forward contracts to manage foreign currency risks. The Company has not designated its foreign exchange derivatives as hedges. Accordingly, changes in fair value from these contracts are recorded as  Other expenses, net  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency contracts outstanding consisted of purchase and sale contracts with a total gross notional value of approximately   $900 million   and durations of   less than six months  . The net fair value of these contracts at   September 30, 2016   was a net asset of approximately   $4 million  , of which approximately   $8 million   is included in  Other current assets  and approximately   $4 million   is included in  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  At   March 31, 2016  , foreign currency contracts outstanding consisted of purchase and sale contracts with a total gross notional value of approximately   $332 million   and durations of   less than three months  . The net fair value of these contracts at   March 31, 2016   was a net liability of approximately   $1 million  , of which approximately   $2 million   is included in  Other current assets  and approximately   $3 million   is included in  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  A summary of the effect of the foreign exchange derivatives on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:   

  The Company is subject to collateral security arrangements with most of its major counterparties. These arrangements require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements were either in a net asset position or under the established threshold at   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  . The Company posted no collateral at   September 30, 2016   or   March 31, 2016  . Under these agreements, if the Company s credit ratings had been downgraded one rating level, the Company would still not have been required to post collateral.

NOTE G   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  :   

           (1) 
    The Company s investments in money market funds are classified as  Cash and cash equivalents  in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
              (2) 
    Refer to Note F,  Derivatives  for additional information. 
     At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
  The carrying values of financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings, approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. 
  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s other financial instruments that were not measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Estimated fair value of total debt is based on quoted prices for similar liabilities for which significant inputs are observable except for certain long-term lease obligations, for which fair value approximates carrying value (Level 2). 
              (2) 
    Estimated fair value for the facility exit reserve is determined using the Company s incremental borrowing rate at   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the facility exit reserve included carrying values of approximately   $4 million   and   $4 million  , respectively, in  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and approximately   $9 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, in  Other noncurrent liabilities  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Level 3).

NOTE H   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company, various subsidiaries, and certain current and former officers have been or, from time to time, may be named as defendants in various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. The Company may also become involved with contract issues and disputes with customers, including government customers. 
  On March 24, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed under seal in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a complaint against the Company in partial intervention under the qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims Act (FCA). The underlying complaint was filed under seal by an individual plaintiff on August 24, 2009. On May 29, 2014, the case was unsealed. Both the DOJ and the individual plaintiff have filed amended complaints. The current complaints relate to government sales transactions under the Company s General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contract, entered into in 2002 and extended until present through subsequent amendments. In sum and substance, the current complaints allege that the Company provided inaccurate commercial discounting information to the GSA during contract negotiations and that, as a result, the GSA s contract discount was lower than it otherwise would have been. In addition, the complaints allege that the Company failed to apply the full negotiated discount in some instances and to pay sufficient rebates pursuant to the contract s price reduction clause. In addition to FCA claims, the current complaints also assert common law causes of action. The DOJ complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, including treble damages and civil penalties. The complaint by the individual plaintiff alleges that the U.S. government has suffered damages in   excess of $100 million   and seeks an unspecified amount of damages, including treble damages and civil penalties. The Company filed motions to dismiss the current complaints. On March 31, 2015, the court issued decisions denying the Company's motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint, and granting in part and denying in part the Company's motion to dismiss the individual plaintiff's complaint. The discovery phase of the case is proceeding pursuant to the court s scheduling orders. On October 30, 2014, the GSA Suspension and Debarment Division issued a Show Cause Letter to the Company in response to the complaints summarized above. In sum, the letter called on the Company to demonstrate why the U.S. government should continue to contract with the Company, given the litigation allegations made in these complaints. On December 19, 2014, the Company provided a detailed response to the Show Cause Letter. In July 2015, after the Company agreed to assume certain additional reporting requirements during the pendency of the litigation, the GSA Suspension and Debarment Division advised the Company that it had concluded its review and determined that the Company is a responsible contractor with which government agencies could continue to contract. The parties have periodically been engaged in settlement negotiations and, on October 24, 2016, the parties filed a joint motion advising the court that they have reached an agreement-in-principle to resolve the litigation and requesting a 45-day extension of the current court schedule to permit the parties to draft and execute a formal settlement agreement. Also on October 24, 2016, the court granted the joint motion. The agreement-in-principle reached by the parties calls for settlement of the litigation for a payment of   $45 million   without admitting any wrongdoing. This agreement-in-principle is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement, concurrence of the GSA and approval by the United States District Court. As a result of this agreement-in-principle, the legal accrual for this litigation has increased in the current quarter and is recorded in  Other expenses, net  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As the legal accrual for this litigation has increased, there has been a reduction to the estimated range of reasonably possible loss reflected below. There can be no assurance that the settlement of this litigation will be finalized and approved by the United States District Court. In the event that the settlement of this litigation is not ultimately finalized and approved, this litigation would continue. In that event, the Company cannot predict the amount of damages likely to result from the litigation summarized above. Although the timing and ultimate outcome of this litigation cannot be determined, the Company believes that the material aspects of the liability theories set forth in the litigation complaints are unfounded. The Company also believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously contest the lawsuit should a settlement agreement not be executed. 
  With respect to litigation in general, based on the Company s experience, management believes that the damages amounts claimed in a case are not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of cases. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses in connection with its current lawsuits and material claims and disputes, and intends to vigorously contest each of them. 
  In the opinion of the Company s management based upon information currently available to the Company, while the outcome of these lawsuits, claims and disputes is uncertain, the likely results of these lawsuits, claims and disputes are not expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although the effect could be material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows for any interim reporting period. The agreement-in-principle of the litigation detailed above, if finalized and approved by the United States District Court, would also have a negative effect on quarterly and full fiscal year cash flows. For some of these matters, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss due to the stage of the matter and/or other particular circumstances of the matter. For others, a range of reasonably possible loss can be estimated. For those matters for which such a range can be estimated, the Company estimates that, in the aggregate, the range of reasonably possible loss is from   zero   to   $25 million  . This is in addition to amounts, if any, that have been accrued for those matters.

NOTE I   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  Stock Repurchases:   On November 13, 2015, the Board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the Company to acquire up to   $750 million   of its common stock. During the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased approximately   3.1 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $100 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company remained authorized to purchase approximately   $650 million   of its common stock under its current stock repurchase program. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss:   Foreign currency translation losses included in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016   were approximately   $435 million   and   $416 million  , respectively.

NOTE J   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER COMMON SHARE 
  Basic net income per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net income allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards. 
  The following table presents basic and diluted income from continuing operations per common share information for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, approximately   1 million   and   2 million   shares of Company common stock underlying restricted stock awards (RSAs) and options to purchase common stock were excluded from the calculation because their effect on income per share was anti-dilutive during the respective periods. Weighted average restricted stock awards of approximately   5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were considered participating securities in the calculation of net income allocable to common stockholders. 
  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, approximately   1 million   and   2 million   shares of Company common stock underlying RSAs and options to purchase common stock were excluded from the calculation because their effect on income per share was anti-dilutive during the respective periods. Weighted average restricted stock awards of approximately   5 million   and   4 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were considered participating securities in the calculation of net income allocable to common stockholders.

There were no capitalized share-based compensation costs for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The value of performance share units (PSUs) is determined using the closing price of the Company s common stock on the last trading day of the quarter until the awards are granted. Compensation costs for the PSUs are amortized over the requisite service periods based on the expected level of achievement of the performance targets. At the conclusion of the performance periods for the PSUs, the applicable number of shares of common stock, RSAs or restricted stock units (RSUs) granted may vary based upon the level of achievement of the performance targets and the approval of the Company s Compensation and Human Resources Committee (which may reduce any award for any reason in its discretion).

For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company issued stock options for approximately   1.1 million   shares and   0.9 million   shares, respectively. The weighted average fair values and assumptions used for the options granted were as follows:   

           (1) 
    Expected volatility is measured using historical daily price changes of the Company s common stock over the respective expected term of the options and the implied volatility derived from the market prices of the Company s traded options. 
              (2) 
    The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
              (3) 
    The expected life is the number of years the Company estimates that options will be outstanding prior to exercise.   The Company s computation of expected life was determined based on the simplified method (the average of the vesting period and option term).  
     The table below summarizes the RSAs and RSUs granted under the 1-year PSUs for the Company s fiscal year 2016 and 2015 incentive plan years. The RSAs and RSUs were granted in the first quarter of fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively. The RSAs and RSUs vest 34% on the date of grant and 33% on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date.   

  The table below summarizes the shares of common stock issued under the 3-year PSUs for the Company s fiscal year 2014 and 2013 incentive plan years in the first quarter of fiscal years   2017   and   2016  , respectively. 

The table below summarizes the RSAs and RSUs granted under the 1-year PSUs for the Company s fiscal year 2016 and 2015 sales retention equity programs.

           (1) 
    The fair value is based on the quoted market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date. 
              (2) 
    The fair value is based on the quoted market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company s common stock prior to vesting of the RSUs, which is calculated using a risk-free interest rate. 
      Employee Stock Purchase Plan:   The Company maintains the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for all eligible employees. The ESPP offer period is semi-annual and allows participants to purchase the Company s common stock at   95%   of the closing price of the stock on the last day of the offer period. The ESPP is non-compensatory. For the six-month offer period ended   June 30, 2016  , the Company issued approximately   0.1 million   shares under the ESPP at   $31.19   per share. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   29.1 million   shares are available for future issuances under the ESPP. 

NOTE L   INCOME TAXES 
  Income tax expense for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $94 million   and   $173 million  , respectively, compared with income tax expense for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2015   of approximately   $75 million   and   $163 million  , respectively. 
  The Company s estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of discrete items, for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   29.0%   and   29.6%  , respectively. Changes in tax laws, the outcome of tax audits and any other changes in potential tax liabilities may result in additional tax expense or benefit in fiscal year   2017  , which are not considered in the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate. While the Company does not currently view any such items as individually material to the results of the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations, the impact of certain items may yield additional tax expense or benefit in the remaining quarters of fiscal year   2017  . The Company is anticipating a fiscal year   2017   effective tax rate between   28%   and   29%  . 

NOTE M   SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INFORMATION 
  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest payments were approximately   $43 million   and   $32 million  , respectively, and income taxes paid, net from continuing operations were approximately   $202 million   and   $131 million  , respectively. For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the excess tax benefits from share-based incentive awards included in financing activities from continuing operations were approximately   $4 million   and   $3 million  , respectively. 
  Non-cash financing activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   consisted of treasury common shares issued in connection with the following: share-based incentive awards issued under the Company s equity compensation plans of approximately   $43 million   (net of approximately   $33 million   of income taxes withheld) and   $41 million   (net of approximately   $27 million   of income taxes withheld), respectively; discretionary stock contributions to the CA, Inc. Savings Harvest Plan of approximately   $24 million   for each period; and treasury common shares issued in connection with the Company s ESPP of approximately   $2 million   for each period.

The Company uses a notional pooling arrangement with an international bank to help manage global liquidity. Under this pooling arrangement, the Company and its participating subsidiaries may maintain either cash deposit or borrowing positions through local currency accounts with the bank, so long as the aggregate position of the global pool is a notionally calculated net cash deposit. Because it maintains a security interest in the cash deposits and has the right to offset the cash deposits against the borrowings, the bank provides the Company and its participating subsidiaries favorable interest terms on both. The activity under this notional pooling arrangement for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  A summary of key results for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   is as follows: 
  Revenue 
             
    Total revenue   increased     $13 million   primarily due to an increase in software fees and other revenue, partially offset by decreases in professional services revenue and subscription and maintenance revenue. 
                
    We expect revenue for fiscal 2017 to be consistent or increase slightly compared with fiscal 2016. We currently expect foreign exchange not to have a significant effect on revenue for fiscal 2017. 
     Bookings 
             
    Total bookings   decreased   primarily due to the renewal with a large system integrator in excess of $500 million for a term greater than five years that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe renewals. 
                
    Renewal bookings decreased by a percentage in the mid-50s primarily due to the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe renewals due to the timing of our renewal portfolio. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, renewal bookings decreased by a percentage in the high single digits primarily due to a decrease in mainframe renewals as set forth above. 
                
    Total new product sales decreased by a percentage in the mid-20s primarily due to new product sales in connection with the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe capacity sales that were not associated with this transaction. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, total new product sales decreased by a percentage in the low teens primarily due to a decrease in mainframe capacity sales. 
                
    Mainframe solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the mid-40s primarily due to new product sales in connection with the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe capacity sales. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, mainframe solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the mid-20s primarily due to a decrease in mainframe capacity sales. 
                
    Enterprise solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the high teens primarily due to new product sales in connection with the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, enterprise solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the high single digits due to the decline in the overall renewal portfolio. 
                
    We expect fiscal 2017 renewals to increase by a percentage in the high teens compared with fiscal 2016. 
     Expenses 
             
    Operating expenses   decreased   primarily due to the overall decreases in personnel-related costs of $18 million as a result of lower headcount, a decrease in amortization expense related to capitalized software and other intangible assets of $18 million and transaction costs of $17 million associated with our acquisitions of Rally Software Development Corp. (Rally) and Xceedium, Inc. (Xceedium) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by an increase in legal settlement expense included in other expenses, net of $25 million.

Income taxes 
   Diluted income per common share from continuing operations 
             
    Diluted income per common share from continuing operations   increased   to   $0.50   from   $0.39   primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses. 
     Segment results 
             
    Mainframe Solutions revenue   decreased   primarily due to insufficient revenue from prior period new sales to offset the decline in revenue contribution from renewals. Mainframe Solutions operating margin was consistent compared with the year-ago period. 
                
    Enterprise Solutions revenue   increased   primarily due to an increase in sales of our enterprise solutions products recognized on an upfront basis and an increase in SaaS revenue, primarily from our CA Agile Central products (acquired from Rally). Enterprise Solutions operating margin increased primarily due to the transaction costs associated with our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
                
    Services revenue   decreased   primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements from prior periods. This decline in professional services engagements is a result of several factors including our products being easier to install and manage, an increase in the use of partners for services engagements and the completion of non-strategic projects during previous periods. Operating margin for Services decreased primarily due to the overall decline in professional services revenue. 
     Cash flows from continuing operations 
             
    Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   was   $58 million  , representing a   decrease   of   $101 million   compared with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of   $43 million   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . The   decrease   in cash from operating activities was due to a decrease in cash collections from billings of   $86 million   primarily from lower single installment collections of $70 million and an increase in income tax payments, net of   $26 million  , partially offset by a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll of   $29 million  . 

QUARTERLY UPDATE 
             
    Effective July 26, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors appointed Kieran J. McGrath as Senior Vice President and interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. McGrath was previously the Company s Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. 

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
  Management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Following is a summary of the principal quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review performance:   

25 

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    Total debt at September 30, 2015 has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   (Topic 835). Refer to Note 1,  Significant Accounting Policies  of our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information. 
              (2) 
    Refer to the discussion in the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of this MD A for additional information on expected future cash collections from committed contracts and revenue backlog. 
     Analyses of our performance indicators shown above and our segment performance can be found in the  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  sections of this MD A. 
  Total Revenue:   Total revenue is the amount of revenue recognized during the reporting period from the sale of license, maintenance, SaaS and professional services agreements. Amounts recognized as subscription and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Professional services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed or recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the related software arrangement. Software fees and other revenue generally represents license fee revenue recognized at the inception of a license agreement (upfront basis) and also includes our SaaS revenue, which is recognized as services are provided. 
  Subscription and Maintenance Revenue:     Subscription and maintenance revenue is the amount of revenue recognized ratably during the reporting period from: (i) subscription license agreements that were in effect during the period, generally including maintenance that is bundled with and not separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, (ii) maintenance agreements associated with providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades that are separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, and (iii) license agreements bundled with additional products, maintenance or professional services for which vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) has not been established. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us, as well as by distributors and volume partners, value-added resellers and exclusive representatives to end-users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end-users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. The vast majority of our subscription and maintenance revenue in any particular reporting period comes from contracts signed in prior periods, generally ranging in duration from three to five years. 
  Total Bookings:   Total bookings, or sales, includes the incremental value of all subscription, maintenance and professional services contracts and software fees and other contracts entered into during the reporting period and is generally reflective of the amount of products and services during the period that our customers have agreed to purchase from us. License fees for bookings attributed to sales of software products for which revenue is recognized on an upfront basis is reflected in  Software fees and other  in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, while the maintenance portion is reflected in  Subscription and maintenance  in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our SaaS bookings are recognized as revenue in  Software fees and other,  generally ratably over the term of the SaaS arrangement, rather than upfront. 
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

Our management looks within total bookings at renewal bookings, which we define as bookings attributable to the renewable value of a prior contract (  i.e.,   the maintenance value and, in the case of non-perpetual licenses, the license value), and at total new product sales, which we define as sales of mainframe and enterprise solutions products and mainframe solutions capacity that are new or in addition to sales of products or mainframe solutions capacity previously contracted for by a customer. Renewal bookings, as we report them, do not include new product or capacity sales or professional services arrangements and are reflected as subscription and maintenance bookings in the period (for which revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the contract). Renewals can close before their scheduled renewal date for a number of reasons, including customer preference, customer needs for additional products or capacity, or our preference. The level of renewals closed prior to scheduled expiration dates and the reasons for such closings can vary from quarter to quarter. Generally, quarters with smaller renewal inventories result in a lower level of bookings because renewal bookings will be lower and, to a lesser extent, because renewals remain an important opportunity for new product sales. 
  Mainframe solutions new product sales and capacity growth can be inconsistent on both a quarterly and annual basis. We believe the period-over-period change in mainframe solutions new product sales and capacity combined is a more appropriate measure of performance and, therefore, we provide only total mainframe solutions new sales information, which includes mainframe solutions capacity. The amount of new product sales for a period, as currently tracked by us, requires estimation by management and has been historically reported by providing only growth rate comparisons. Within a given period, the amount of new product sales may not be material to the change in our total bookings or revenue compared with prior periods. New product sales can be reflected as subscription and maintenance bookings in the period (for which revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the contract) or in software fees and other bookings (which are recognized as software fees and other revenue in the current period). 
  Subscription and Maintenance Bookings:     Subscription and maintenance bookings is the aggregate incremental amount we expect to collect from our customers over the terms of the underlying subscription and maintenance agreements entered into during a reporting period. These amounts include the sale of products either directly by us or through distributors and volume partners, value-added resellers and exclusive representatives to end-users and may include the right for the customer to receive unspecified future software products and/or additional products, services or other fees for which we have not established VSOE for all undelivered elements. These amounts are expected to be recognized ratably as subscription and maintenance revenue over the applicable term of the agreements. Subscription and maintenance bookings excludes the value associated with perpetual licenses for which revenue is recognized on an upfront basis, SaaS offerings and professional services arrangements. 
  Within bookings, we also consider the yield on our renewals. We define  renewal yield  as the percentage of the renewable value of a prior contract (  i.e.,   the maintenance value and, in the case of non-perpetual licenses, the license value) realized in current period bookings. The renewable value of a prior contract is an estimate affected by various factors including contractual renewal terms, price increases and other conditions. Price increases are not considered as part of the renewable value of the prior period contract. We estimate the aggregate renewal yield for a quarter based on a review of material transactions representing a majority of the dollar value of renewals during the current period. There may be no correlation between year-over-year changes in bookings and year-over-year changes in renewal yield, since renewal yield is based on the renewable value of contracts of various durations, most of which are longer than one year. 
  The license and maintenance agreements that contribute to subscription and maintenance bookings represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods that range generally from three to five years, although in certain cases customer commitments can be for longer or shorter periods. These current period bookings are often renewals of prior contracts that also had various durations, usually from three to five years. The amount of new subscription and maintenance bookings recorded in a period is affected by the volume, duration and value of contracts renewed during that period. Subscription and maintenance bookings typically increases in each consecutive quarter during a fiscal year, with the first quarter having the least bookings and the fourth quarter having the most bookings. However, subscription and maintenance bookings may not always follow the pattern of increasing in consecutive quarters during a fiscal year, and the quarter-to-quarter differences in subscription and maintenance bookings may vary. Given the varying durations and dollar amounts of the contracts being renewed, year-over-year comparisons of bookings are not always indicative of the overall bookings trend. 
  Additionally, period-to-period changes in subscription and maintenance bookings do not necessarily correlate to changes in cash receipts. The contribution to current period revenue from subscription and maintenance bookings from any single license or maintenance agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term for these agreements. 
  Weighted Average Subscription and Maintenance License Agreement Duration in Years:   The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all subscription and maintenance agreements executed during a period, weighted by the total contract value of each individual agreement. Weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of license agreements entered into during a period. Weighted average duration information is disclosed in order to provide additional understanding of the volume of our bookings. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Annualized Subscription and Maintenance Bookings:   Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings is an indicator that normalizes the bookings recorded in the current period to account for contract length. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all new subscription and maintenance license agreements entered into during a period by the weighted average subscription and license agreement duration in years for all such subscription and maintenance license agreements recorded during the same period. 
  Total Revenue Backlog:   Total revenue backlog represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future as either subscription and maintenance revenue, professional services revenue or software fees and other revenue associated with contractually committed amounts billed or to be billed as of the balance sheet date. Total revenue backlog is composed of amounts recognized as liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue (billed or collected) as well as unearned amounts yet to be billed under subscription and maintenance and software fees and other agreements. Classification of amounts as current and noncurrent depends on when such amounts are expected to be earned and, therefore, recognized as revenue. Amounts that are expected to be earned and, therefore, recognized as revenue in 12 months or less are classified as current, while amounts expected to be earned in greater than 12 months are classified as noncurrent. The portion of the total revenue backlog that relates to subscription and maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the underlying agreements and is reported as subscription and maintenance revenue in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Generally, we believe that an increase or decrease in the current portion of revenue backlog on a year-over-year basis is a favorable or unfavorable indicator of future subscription and maintenance revenue performance, respectively, due to the high percentage of our revenue that is recognized from license agreements that are already committed and being recognized ratably. The value of backlog can fluctuate based upon the timing of contract expirations. 
   Deferred revenue (billed or collected)  is composed of: (i) amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition and (ii) amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been earned.

  Revenue 
  Total Revenue 
  Total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017   increased   compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in software fees and other revenue, partially offset by decreases in professional services revenue and subscription and maintenance revenue as described below. There was an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  Total revenue in the first half of fiscal 2017   increased   compared with the first half of fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in software fees and other revenue, partially offset by decreases in subscription and maintenance revenue and professional services revenue as described below. There was an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $8 million for the first half of fiscal 2017. 
  In general, we treat acquired technologies as organic in the quarter of their one year anniversary date. Rally and Xceedium were acquired during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, as such, were treated as organic in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue included revenue of $35 million from our Rally and Xceedium acquisitions. 
  We expect revenue for fiscal 2017 to be consistent or increase slightly compared with fiscal 2016. We currently expect foreign exchange not to have a significant effect on revenue for fiscal 2017.  We currently expect a slight percentage decrease in revenue during our third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the year-ago period as a result of the composition of the renewal portfolio, which had a greater level of up-front transactions that closed in the year-ago period. In addition, we expect a lower level of services revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the year-ago period.

Subscription and Maintenance 
  Subscription and maintenance revenue for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, due to a decrease in Mainframe Solutions revenue (refer to  Performance of Segments  below) as well as Enterprise Solutions revenue recognized on a ratable basis. There was an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $3 million and $6 million for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017  , respectively. 
  Professional Services 
  Professional services revenue primarily includes revenue derived from product implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services. Professional services revenue for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements from prior periods. This decline in professional services engagements is a result of several factors including our products being easier to install and manage, an increase in the use of partners for services engagements and the completion of non-strategic projects during previous periods. For the long term, we expect new versions of our on-premise software to be easier to implement and a higher percentage of our business to shift to a SaaS-based model, which could potentially reduce the demand for our professional services engagements. 
  Software Fees and Other 
  Software fees and other revenue consists of revenue that is recognized on an upfront basis and also includes our SaaS revenue. Upfront revenue includes revenue associated with enterprise solutions products sold on an upfront basis directly by our sales force or through transactions with distributors and volume partners, value-added resellers and exclusive representatives (sometimes referred to as our  indirect  or  channel  revenue). Our SaaS revenue is recognized as the services are provided, generally ratably over the term of the SaaS arrangement, rather than upfront. 
  Software fees and other revenue for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     increased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to an increase in sales of our enterprise solutions products recognized on an upfront basis and an increase in SaaS revenue, primarily from our CA Agile Central products (acquired from Rally). The increase in sales of our enterprise solutions products recognized on an upfront basis was partially attributable to an increase in both free-standing new sales and sales into our Named and Growth customer accounts. 
  Software fees and other revenue for the   first half   of fiscal   2017     increased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   primarily due to an increase in SaaS revenue, primarily from our CA Agile Central products (acquired from Rally), and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of our enterprise solutions products recognized on an upfront basis. 
  Total Revenue by Geography 
  The following tables present the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Revenue in the United States for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     increased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to an increase in sales of our enterprise solutions products recognized on an upfront basis and an increase in SaaS revenue. International revenue for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   was generally consistent compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . There was an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  Revenue in the United States for the   first half   of fiscal   2017     increased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   primarily due to revenue during our first quarter of fiscal 2017 from our Rally and Xceedium acquisitions. International revenue for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   was generally consistent compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . There was an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $8 million for the first half of fiscal 2017. 
  Price changes do not have a material effect on revenue in the period they become effective as a result of our ratable subscription model. 
  Expenses 
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to the overall decreases in personnel-related costs of $18 million as a result of lower headcount, a decrease in amortization expense related to capitalized software and other intangible assets of $18 million and transaction costs of $17 million associated with our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by an increase in legal settlement expense included in other expenses, net of $25 million. 
  Operating expenses for the   first half   of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   due to transaction costs of $20 million associated with our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and a decrease in amortization expense related to other intangible assets of $16 million. In addition, the decrease in expenses were also driven by decreases in various operating expenses of $44 million attributable to such items as lower personnel-related costs as a result of lower headcount and lower external consulting costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other expenses, net of $26 million mainly from higher legal settlements expense and operating expenses of $40 million from our Rally and Xceedium acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  In general, we treat acquired technologies as organic in the quarter of their one year anniversary date. Rally and Xceedium were acquired during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, as such, were treated as organic in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total operating expenses included expenses of $40 million from our Rally and Xceedium acquisitions. 
  Costs of Licensing and Maintenance 
  Costs of licensing and maintenance include technical support, royalties, SaaS, hosting, and other manufacturing and distribution costs. Costs of licensing and maintenance for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   were generally consistent compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively. 
  Cost of Professional Services 
  Cost of professional services consists primarily of our personnel-related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in external consulting costs. 
  Operating margin for professional services   decreased   to   3%   for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with   6%   for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . Operating margin for professional services   decreased   to   3%   for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with   8%   for the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . The decrease in operating margin for professional services was primarily attributable to the overall decline in professional services revenue. 
  Operating margin for professional services does not include certain additional direct costs that are included within the Services segment (refer to  Performance of Segments  below). Expenses for the Services segment consist of cost of professional services and other direct costs included within selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses. 
  Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs 
  Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs relate to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. 
  We evaluate the useful lives and recoverability of capitalized software and other intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. These evaluations require complex assumptions about key factors such as future customer demand, technology trends and the impact of those factors on the technology we acquire and develop for our products. Impairments or revisions to useful lives could result from the use of alternative assumptions that reflect reasonably possible outcomes related to future customer demand or technology trends for assets within the Enterprise Solutions segment.

     Table of Contents  

Amortization of capitalized software costs for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   as a result of a decrease in amortization of our internally developed software products. 
  Amortization of capitalized software costs for the   first half   of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   as a result of a decrease in amortization of our internally developed software products, partially offset by an increase in amortization of capitalized software costs related to our Rally and Xceedium acquisitions. 
  We have continued to leverage Agile development methodologies, which are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent revisions to a product release s features and functions as the software is being developed. As a result, capitalization is commenced much later in the development life cycle. As such, we have not capitalized a significant amount of internally developed software costs since fiscal 2014, resulting in a decrease in amortization expense year-over-year. 
  Selling and Marketing 
  Selling and marketing expenses include the costs relating to our sales force, channel partners, corporate and business marketing and customer training programs. Selling and marketing expenses for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to a decrease in other personnel-related costs of $9 million. 
  Selling and marketing expenses for the   first half   of fiscal   2017     increased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   primarily due to $16 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, which were mainly personnel-related. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in other personnel-related costs of $9 million. 
  General and Administrative 
  General and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate functions, including our executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources, corporate communications and other costs such as provisions for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to $15 million of transaction costs associated with our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
  General and administrative expenses for the   first half   of fiscal   2017     decreased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   primarily due to $18 million of transaction costs associated with our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
  Product Development and Enhancements 
  For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , product development and enhancements expense represented   13%   and   15%  , respectively, of total revenue. For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , product development and enhancements expense   decreased   compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs of $12 million as a result of lower headcount. 
  For the   first half   of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , product development and enhancements expense represented 14% of total revenue. For the   first half   of fiscal   2017  , product development and enhancements expense   decreased   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs as a result of lower headcount, partially offset by costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, which were mainly personnel-related. 
  Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets 
  For the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017  , depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets expense decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense associated with other intangible assets that became fully amortized in recent periods. 
  Other Expenses, Net

During the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017  , other expenses, net included a $27 million increase in legal settlements. This expense related to an agreement-in-principle for $45 million to settle the litigation referred to in Note H,  Commitments and Contingencies,  in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect full payment for the agreement-in-principle to be made in the second half of fiscal 2017. 
  During the   first half   of fiscal   2016  , we recognized a gain from various favorable adjustments associated with our legal accruals and a legal settlement. 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   increased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, as a result of interest associated with the issuance of our 3.600% Senior Notes due August 2020 during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and a new term loan agreement entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income tax expense for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   was   $94 million   and   $173 million  , respectively, compared with income tax expense for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016   of   $75 million   and   $163 million  , respectively. 
  Our estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of discrete items, for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016   was   29.0%   and   29.6%  , respectively. Changes in tax laws, the outcome of tax audits and any other changes in potential tax liabilities may result in additional tax expense or benefit in fiscal   2017  , which are not considered in our estimated annual effective tax rate. While we do not currently view any such items as individually material to the results of our consolidated financial position or results of operations, the impact of certain items may yield additional tax expense or benefit in the remaining quarters of fiscal   2017  . We are anticipating a fiscal   2017   effective tax rate between   28%   and   29%  . 
  Performance of Segments  
  Our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments comprise our software business organized by the nature of our software offerings and the platforms on which the products operate. The Services segment comprises product implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services, including those directly related to the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions software that we sell to our customers. 
  Segment expenses do not include amortization of purchased software; amortization of other intangible assets; amortization of internally developed software products; share-based compensation expense; certain foreign exchange derivative hedging gains and losses; approved severance and facility actions by the Board; and other miscellaneous costs. 
  Segment financial information for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016   was as follows:

Mainframe Solutions revenue for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, primarily due to insufficient revenue from prior period new sales to offset the decline in revenue contribution from renewals. Mainframe Solutions operating margin for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   was consistent compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively.   

Enterprise Solutions revenue for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017     increased   compared with the year-ago period primarily due to an increase in software fees and other revenue as described above. Enterprise Solutions operating margin for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   increased compared with the year-ago period primarily due to the transaction costs associated with our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Services revenue for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements from prior periods. This decline in professional services engagements is a result of several factors including our products being easier to install and manage, an increase in the use of partners for services engagements and the completion of non-strategic projects during previous periods. For the long term, we expect new versions of our on-premise software to be easier to implement and a higher percentage of our business to shift to a SaaS-based model, which could potentially reduce the demand for our professional services engagements. Operating margin for Services for the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2017   decreased compared with the   second   quarter and   first half   of fiscal   2016  , respectively, primarily due to the overall decline in professional services revenue.

  Bookings 
  Second Quarter Comparison Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016 
  Total Bookings:   For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , total bookings were   $729 million   and   $1,383 million  , respectively. The   decrease   in total bookings was primarily due to the renewal with a large system integrator in excess of $500 million for a term greater than five years that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe renewals. 
  Subscription and Maintenance Bookings:   For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , subscription and maintenance bookings were   $531 million   and   $1,192 million  , respectively. The   decrease   in subscription and maintenance bookings was primarily attributable to the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe renewals. 
  Renewal Bookings  : For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , renewal bookings decreased by a percentage in the mid-50s compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe renewals due to the timing of our renewal portfolio. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, renewal bookings decreased by a percentage in the high single digits compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   primarily due to a decrease in mainframe renewals as set forth above. 
             
    Renewal Yield:   For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , our percentage renewal yield was in the low 90% range. 
                
    License Agreements over $10 million:   During the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , we executed a total of   11   license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of   $209 million  . During the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  , we executed a total of   11   license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of   $887 million  . The decrease in value was primarily due to the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
                
    Annualized Subscription and Maintenance Bookings and Weighted Average Subscription and Maintenance License Agreement Duration in Years:   Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings   decreased   from   $267 million   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   to   $178 million   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  . The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years   decreased   from   4.46   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   to   2.99   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  . These decreases were due to the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 with a term greater than five years. Although each contract is subject to terms negotiated by the respective parties, we do not expect the weighted average subscription and maintenance agreement duration in years to change materially from historical levels for end-user contracts. 
     Total New Product Sales:   Within total bookings, total new product sales decreased by a percentage in the mid-20s for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the year-ago period primarily due to new product sales in connection with the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe capacity sales that were not associated with this transaction. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, total new product sales decreased by a percentage in the low teens for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the year-ago period primarily due to a decrease in mainframe capacity sales.

Within Total New Product Sales: 
                
    Mainframe Solutions New Product Sales:   For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  ,   mainframe solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the mid-40s compared with the year-ago period primarily due to new product sales in connection with the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in mainframe capacity sales due to a decrease in mainframe renewals not associated with the large system integrator transaction. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, mainframe solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the mid-20s for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the year-ago period primarily due to a decrease in mainframe capacity sales. Overall, we expect our Mainframe Solutions revenue to decline by a percentage in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
                
    Enterprise Solutions New Product Sales:   For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  ,   enterprise solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the high teens compared with the year-ago period primarily due to new product sales in connection with the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, enterprise solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the high single digits for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by the decline in the renewal portfolio, partially offset by a higher than historical average attach rate of new product sales to renewals. Enterprise Solutions new product sales performance was negatively affected by certain products that are more mature and not growing, but which positively affected segment operating margin and cash flow from operations. 
     Total Bookings by Geography:   Total bookings in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   decreased in the United States, slightly offset by an increase in total bookings in all other regions compared with the year-ago period. The decrease in the United States was primarily due to a decrease in renewals, including the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
  New Product Sales by Geography:   Total new product sales in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   decreased primarily in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the Latin America region compared with the year-ago period. The decrease in the United States was primarily due to new product sales associated with renewals including the aforementioned renewal with a large system integrator that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in the Latin America region was primarily due to the continued macro-economic challenges in the region. Total new product sales in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   increased in the Asia Pacific Japan and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions compared with the year-ago primarily due to an increase in sales into our Named and Growth customer accounts. 
  First Half Comparison Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016 
  Total Bookings:   For the   first half   of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , total bookings were   $2,082 million   and   $2,045 million  , respectively. The   increase   in total bookings was primarily due to slight increases in renewals and total new product sales. 
  Total bookings for the first half of fiscal 2017 included the replacement and extension of a large system integrator transaction that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018 that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The large system integrator transaction provided an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million and extended the term of the replaced agreement for an additional five years. Total bookings for the first half of fiscal 2016 included a renewal with a large system integrator in excess of $500 million for a term greater than five years that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
  Subscription and Maintenance Bookings:   For the   first half   of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  , subscription and maintenance bookings were   $1,704 million   and   $1,717 million  , respectively. The   decrease   in subscription and maintenance bookings was primarily attributable to a decrease in enterprise solutions renewals, largely offset by an increase in mainframe solutions renewals. This decrease in enterprise solutions renewals was due to the composition of the renewal portfolio being more heavily weighted towards mainframe solutions in the first half of fiscal 2017. 
  Renewal Bookings  : For the   first half   of fiscal   2017  , renewal bookings increased by a percentage in the low single digits compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016   primarily due to an increase in mainframe solutions renewals, largely offset by a decrease in enterprise solutions renewals. This decrease in enterprise solutions renewals was due to the composition of the renewal portfolio being more heavily weighted towards mainframe solutions in the first half of fiscal 2017. 
             
    License Agreements over $10 million:   During the   first half   of fiscal   2017  , we executed a total of   25   license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of   $1,119 million  . During the   first half   of fiscal   2016  , we executed a total of   17   license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of   $1,101 million  .

Annualized Subscription and Maintenance Bookings and Weighted Average Subscription and Maintenance License Agreement Duration in Years:   Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings   decreased   from   $428 million   in the   first half   of fiscal   2016   to   $408 million   in the   first half   of fiscal   2017  . The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years   increased   from   4.01   in the   first half   of fiscal   2016   to   4.18   in the   first half   of fiscal   2017  . 
      Total New Product Sales:   Within total bookings, total new product sales increased by a percentage in the low single digits for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   compared with the year-ago period primarily due to an increase in mainframe solutions new product sales.

    Mainframe Solutions New Product Sales:   For the   first half   of fiscal   2017  ,   mainframe solutions new product sales (which includes sales of mainframe products and mainframe capacity) increased by a percentage in the mid-teens compared with the year-ago period primarily due to an increase in sales of mainframe products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of mainframe capacity. 
                
    Enterprise Solutions New Product Sales:   For the   first half   of fiscal   2017  ,   enterprise solutions new product sales decreased by a percentage in the low single digits compared with the year-ago period, partially offset by the increase in new product sales from Rally and Xceedium in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Enterprise Solutions new product sales performance was negatively affected by certain products that are more mature and not growing, but which positively affected segment operating margin and cash flow from operations. 
     Total Bookings by Geography:   Total bookings in the   first half   of fiscal   2017   increased in all international regions, partially offset by a decrease in the United States, compared with the year-ago period. These year-over-year changes were primarily due to the timing of our renewal portfolio. 
  New Product Sales by Geography:   Total new product sales in the   first half   of fiscal   2017   increased primarily in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in all international regions, except for the Latin America region, compared with the year-ago period. The increase in the United States was primarily due to the aforementioned large system integrator transaction that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the Latin America region was primarily due to the continued macro-economic challenges in the region. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with   83%   held in our subsidiaries outside the United States at   September 30, 2016  . Cash and cash equivalents totaled   $2,585 million   at   September 30, 2016  , representing a   decrease   of   $227 million   from the   March 31, 2016   balance of   $2,812 million  . During the   first half   of fiscal   2017  , there was a   $32 million     unfavorable   translation effect from foreign exchange rates on cash held outside the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
  Although   83%   of our cash and cash equivalents is held by foreign subsidiaries, we currently neither intend nor expect a need to repatriate these funds to the United States in the foreseeable future. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and our investing and financing activities, including, among other things, the payment of regular quarterly dividends, compliance with our debt repayment schedules, repurchases of our common stock and the funding for capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from foreign operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and investing activities, including, among other things, the funding for capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Under our subscription and maintenance agreements, customers generally make installment payments over the term of the agreement, often with at least one payment due at contract execution, for the right to use our software products and receive product support, software fixes and new products when available. The timing and actual amounts of cash received from committed customer installment payments under any specific agreement can be affected by several factors, including the time value of money and the customer s credit rating. Often, the amount received is the result of direct negotiations with the customer when establishing pricing and payment terms. In certain instances, the customer negotiates a price for a single upfront installment payment and seeks its own internal or external financing sources. In other instances, we may assist the customer by arranging financing on the customer s behalf through a third-party financial institution. Alternatively, we may decide to transfer our rights to the future committed installment payments due under the license agreement to a third-party financial institution in exchange for a cash payment. Once transferred, the future committed installments are payable by the customer to the third-party financial institution. Whether the future committed installments have been financed directly by the customer with our assistance or by the transfer of our rights to future committed installments to a third party, these financing agreements may contain limited recourse provisions with respect to our continued performance under the license agreements. Based on our historical experience, we believe that any liability that we may incur as a result of these limited recourse provisions will be immaterial. 
  Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement, are reflected in the liability section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as  Deferred revenue (billed or collected).  Amounts received from either a customer or a third-party financial institution that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact on billings and cash provided by operating activities in the current period. Accordingly, to the extent these collections are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, billings and cash provided by operating activities during the license s later years will be lower than if the payments were received over the license term. We are unable to predict with certainty the amount of cash to be collected from single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, under new or renewed license agreements to be executed in future periods. 
  For the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were   $59 million   compared with   $129 million   for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . For the   first half   of fiscal   2017  , gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were   $82 million   compared with   $166 million   for the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . 
  In any quarter, we may receive payments in advance of the contractually committed date on which the payments were otherwise due. In limited circumstances, we may offer discounts to customers to ensure payment in the current period of invoices that have been billed, but might not otherwise be paid until a subsequent period because of payment terms. Historically, any such discounts have not been material. 
  Amounts due from customers from our subscription licenses are offset by deferred revenue related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for those amounts. The fair value of these amounts may exceed or be less than this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payment under a fixed schedule, to the extent amounts are not yet due and payable by the customer, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to our ongoing commitment to provide maintenance and unspecified future software products as part of the agreement terms. 
  We can estimate the total amounts to be billed from committed contracts, referred to as our  billings backlog,  and the total amount to be recognized as revenue from committed contracts, referred to as our  revenue backlog.  The aggregate amounts of our billings backlog and trade receivables already reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the amounts we expect to collect in the future from committed contracts.

Note:   Revenue backlog includes deferred subscription and maintenance, professional services and software fees and other revenue. 
  We can also estimate the total cash to be collected in the future from committed contracts, referred to as our  Expected future cash collections,  by adding the total billings backlog to the trade accounts receivable, which represent amounts already billed but not collected, from our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  The increase of   15%   in billings backlog at   September 30, 2016   compared with   March 31, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in bookings during the first half of fiscal 2017 largely attributable to the aforementioned large system integrator transaction that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, billings backlog increased 16% at   September 30, 2016   compared with   March 31, 2016  . The increase of   10%   in billings backlog at   September 30, 2016   compared with   September 30, 2015   was primarily a result of an increase in bookings largely attributable to the aforementioned large system integrator transaction that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  The increase in expected future cash collections at   September 30, 2016   compared with   March 31, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was primarily driven by the increase in billings backlog, as described above. 
  Total revenue backlog at   September 30, 2016   compared with   March 31, 2016   was generally consistent. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, total revenue backlog increased 1% at   September 30, 2016   compared with   March 31, 2016  . The increase in total revenue backlog of   4%   at   September 30, 2016   compared with   September 30, 2015   was primarily a result of an increase in bookings largely attributable to the aforementioned large system integrator transaction that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  Current revenue backlog, which is our revenue to be recognized within the next 12 months,   decreased     5%   at   September 30, 2016   compared with   March 31, 2016  . Current revenue backlog   decreased     2%   at   September 30, 2016   compared with   September 30, 2015  . Current revenue backlog declines as contracts move closer to their renewal dates. We expect revenue backlog will fluctuate through the year. 
  Generally, we believe that a change in the current portion of revenue backlog on a year-over-year basis is an indicator of future subscription and maintenance revenue performance due to the high percentage of our revenue that is recognized from license agreements that are already committed and being recognized ratably. We also believe that we would need to demonstrate multiple quarters of total new product and capacity sales growth while maintaining a renewal yield in the low 90% range before growth in the current portion of revenue backlog would be likely to occur.

     Second Quarter Comparison Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016 
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   was   $58 million  , representing a   decrease   of   $101 million   compared with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of   $43 million   in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . The   decrease   in cash from operating activities compared with the year-ago period was due to a decrease in cash collections from billings of   $86 million   primarily from lower single installment collections of $70 million and an increase in income tax payments, net of   $26 million  , partially offset by a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll of   $29 million  . Lower single installment collections were a result of the mix of renewals within the quarter, which had fewer renewals from financial institutions. Historically, a higher volume of single installment payments are received from renewals by financial institutions. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   was   $8 million   compared with   $572 million   for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . The   decrease   in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and purchased software of $610 million compared with the year-ago period, partially offset by proceeds of $48 million from the sale of short-term investments during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, which were received from our acquisition of Rally. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   was   $137 million   compared with net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of   $239 million   for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016  . The change in financing activities was primarily due to our $400 million issuance of the 3.600% Senior Notes due August 2020 during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. In July 2015 and in connection with our acquisition of Rally, we borrowed $400 million under our revolving credit facility, which we repaid using the proceeds from our $400 million issuance of the 3.600% Senior Notes.

First Half Comparison Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016    
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   was   $103 million  , representing a   decrease   of   $128 million   compared with the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . Net cash provided by operating activities   decreased   compared with the year-ago period mainly due to a decrease in cash collections from billings of   $96 million   primarily from lower single installment collections of $84 million and an increase in income tax payments, net of   $71 million  , partially offset by a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll of   $48 million  . 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   was   $17 million   compared with   $622 million   for the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . The   decrease   in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and purchased software of $646 million compared with the year-ago period, partially offset by proceeds received of $48 million from the sale of short-term investments during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, which were received from our acquisition of Rally. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the   first half   of fiscal   2017   was   $281 million   compared with net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of   $39 million   for the   first half   of fiscal   2016  . The change in financing activities was primarily due to our $400 million issuance of the 3.600% Senior Notes due August 2020 during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by an increase in cash received from exercises of stock options of $22 million, a decrease in other financing activities of $18 million primarily for payments associated with a prior period acquisition and a decrease in common stock repurchases of $15 million. In July 2015 and in connection with our acquisition of Rally, we borrowed $400 million under our revolving credit facility, which we repaid using the proceeds from our $400 million issuance of the 3.600% Senior Notes. 
  Debt Obligations 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , our debt obligations consisted of the following:   

  Other Indebtedness 
  We have an unsecured and uncommitted multi-currency line of credit available to meet short-term working capital needs for our subsidiaries, and use guarantees and letters of credit issued by financial institutions to guarantee performance on certain contracts and other items. At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  ,   $52 million   and   $55 million  , respectively, of this line of credit was pledged in support of bank guarantees and other local credit lines. At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , none of these arrangements were drawn down by third parties.

We use a notional pooling arrangement with an international bank to help manage global liquidity. Under this pooling arrangement, we and our participating subsidiaries may maintain either cash deposit or borrowing positions through local currency accounts with the bank, so long as the aggregate position of the global pool is a notionally calculated net cash deposit. Because it maintains a security interest in the cash deposits and has the right to offset the cash deposits against the borrowings, the bank provides us and our participating subsidiaries favorable interest terms on both. The activity under this notional pooling arrangement for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:

  Effect of Exchange Rate Changes 
  There was a   $32 million     unfavorable   effect on our cash balances in the   first half   of fiscal   2017   predominantly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling (10%) and the euro (1%), partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real (10%). 
  There was a   $1 million     unfavorable   effect on our cash balances in the   first half   of fiscal   2016   predominantly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real (19%), the Australian dollar (8%), the Norwegian krone (5%), the Indian rupee (5%) and the New Zealand dollar (14%), partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro (4%) and the Israeli shekel (1%). 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS PRACTICES 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and the estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in our   2016   Form 10-K under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. At   September 30, 2016  , there was no material change to this information. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which creates new ASC Topic 606 (Topic 606) that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. In March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued additional amendments to the technical guidance of Topic 606. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new standard will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and early application for fiscal 2018 is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Topic 606 is expected to have a significant effect on our revenue recognition policies and disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect the standard will have on our ongoing financial reporting.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02),   Leases   (Topic 842), which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 will replace most existing lease accounting guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and requires the modified retrospective method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Although we are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09),   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (Topic 718), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the guidance to determine the adoption methods and the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 (ASU 2016-15),   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (Topic 230), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and requires a retrospective transition method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16 (ASU 2016-16),   Intra-Equity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   (Topic 740), which is intended to eliminate diversity in practice and provide a more accurate depiction of the tax consequences on intercompany asset transfers (excluding inventory). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to immediately recognize the tax consequences on intercompany asset transfers (excluding inventory) at the transaction date, rather than deferring the tax consequences under current GAAP. ASU 2016-16 will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and requires a modified retrospective method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted, but only in the first quarter of an entity s annual fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Item 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes and changes in the market value of our investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. There have been no material changes in our financial risk management strategy or our portfolio management strategy, which is described in our   2016   Form 10-K, subsequent to   March 31, 2016  . 

Item 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the interim Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described in more detail in our   2016   Form 10-K. We believe that as of   September 30, 2016  , there has been no material change to this information. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price.

  ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES   

  On November 13, 2015, the Board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to acquire up to   $750 million   of our common stock. We expect to repurchase shares on the open market, through solicited or unsolicited privately negotiated transactions or otherwise from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. 
  During the   first half   of fiscal   2017  , we repurchased   3.1 million   shares of our common stock for   $100 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , we remained authorized to purchase   $650 million   of our common stock under our current stock repurchase program.

Exhibit 10.2 

July 22, 2016 
    
  Dear Kieran: 
    
  We are pleased that you have agreed to serve as interim Chief Financial Officer during this transitional period.  We consider your continued service and dedication the Company essential to our future success.   
    
  To induce your continued employment and in recognition of your agreement to serve in the interim Chief Financial Role, effectively as of July 26, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), the Company offers you the following: 
    
  (a)    Cash Payments.  The Company will pay you a total cash bonus of   $500,000   as follows: $250,000 on or around the 6-month anniversary of the Effective Date and $250,000 to be paid on around the first anniversary of the Effective date, subject to continued employment on each of the payment dates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company terminates your employment without  cause  (as defined in your offer letter with the Company, dated July 13, 2014, the  Offer Letter ), any installments of these cash payments not already paid to you as of your termination date will be made to you pursuant to the schedule set forth above.  If your employment terminates for any other reason, including if you resign, you will forfeit any installments that have not been paid as of your termination date. 
    
  (b)    Equity grant: You will receive restricted stock units to be granted as of August 15, 2016 pursuant to the 2011 Incentive Plan with a grant date fair value for accounting purposes under FASB ASC Topic 718 of approximately   $500,000  , as determined by the Company based on its valuation methodology as of August 15, 2016 (the  RSUs ). The RSUs will vest and be settled in Company common shares as follows: 34% on the first anniversary of the grant date and 33% on each of the second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued service through each such date, and shall otherwise be governed by the terms set forth in the grant agreement provided by the Company. 
    
  All other terms around your employment and current compensation arrangements remain unchanged and will continue to be governed by your Offer Letter.  As an interim officer, you will not be eligible for participation in the Executive Severance Policy or the Change in Control Severance Policy.  Your employment continues to be at-will, meaning either you or the Company can end your employment at any time, subject to the terms of your Offer Letter and this retention letter.   

For the avoidance of doubt, as stated in your Offer Letter, in the event that the Company terminates your employment for any reason other than for  Cause  (as defined in Appendix A), you remain eligible to receive a severance payment in an amount equal to 12 (twelve) months of your annual base salary in effect at the time of your employment termination (the  Severance Payment ), subject to your execution and non-revocation of a release of claims as described in your Offer Letter.  
    
  The amounts and benefits provided pursuant to this letter are intended to comply with the short term deferral exception to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ), set forth in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4), and shall be interpreted accordingly. 
    
  This Letter Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral and written agreements and understandings between you and the Company with respect to any related subject matter, provided however, the Offer Letter remains in full force and effect.     
    
  We hope that this arrangement encourages your continued effective commitment to the Company.

Appendix A  
  For purposes of this letter, termination for  Cause" will mean employment termination for any of the following reasons:  

The Employee's engagement in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company and its affiliates from time to time (the  Group ), or that materially harms the reputation or financial position of the Group, unless the conduct in question was undertaken in good faith on an informed basis with due care and with a rational business purpose and based upon the honest belief that such conduct was in the best interest of the Group.  

The Employee's indictment or conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any other crime involving dishonesty or fraud.  

The Employee's being found liable in any SEC or other civil or criminal securities law action or entering any cease and desist order with respect to such action (regardless of whether or not he admits or denies liability).  

The Employee's (i) obstructing or impeding, (ii) endeavoring to influence, obstruct or impede or (iii) failing to materially cooperate with, any investigation authorized by the Board or any governmental or self-regulatory entity (an "Investigation"). However, the Employee's failure to waive attorney-client privilege relating to communications with his own attorney in connection with an Investigation shall not constitute "Cause".  

The Employee's withholding, removing, concealing, destroying, altering or by any other means falsifying any material which is requested in connection with an Investigation.  

The Employee's disqualification or bar by any governmental or self-regulatory authority from serving in the capacity in which he was hired or his loss of any governmental or self-regulatory license that is reasonably necessary for him to perform his responsibilities to the Group under the terms of his employment, if (a) the disqualification, bar or loss continues for more than 30 days and (b) during that period the Group uses its good faith efforts to cause the disqualification or bar to be lifted or the license replaced.  

The Employee's unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, or related materials, or the violation of any of the terms of the Employment and Confidentiality Agreement executed by the Employee or any  

Company standard confidentiality policies and procedures, which may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Group and that, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is delivered to the Employee by the Company, which notice specifies in reasonable detail the alleged unauthorized use or disclosure or violation.  

For this definition, no act or omission by the Employee will be "willful" unless it is made by the Employee in bad faith or without a reasonable belief that his act or omission was in the best interests of the Group.
