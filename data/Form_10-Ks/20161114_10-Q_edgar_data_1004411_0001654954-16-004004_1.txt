1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Gilla
Inc. ( Gilla , the  Company  or the
 Registrant ) was incorporated under the laws of the
state of Nevada on March 28, 1995 under the name of Truco,
Inc. 

On July
1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and
outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs Inc. (formerly, E Liquid
Wholesale, Inc.) ( E Vapor Labs ), a Florida based
E-liquid manufacturer. Pursuant to the share purchase agreement,
dated June 25, 2015, the Company paid a total purchase price of
$1,125,000 payable as (i) $225,000 in cash on closing and (ii)
$900,000 in unsecured promissory notes issued on closing, such
promissory notes issued in three equal tranches of $300,000 due
four, nine and eighteen months respectfully from the closing
date. 

On July
14, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and
outstanding shares of E-Liq World, LLC ( VaporLiq ), an
E-liquid subscription based online retailer. Pursuant to the share
purchase agreement, dated July 14, 2015, the Company issued 500,000
Common Shares and warrants for the purchase of 500,000 Common
Shares of the Company exercisable over eighteen months with an
exercise price of $0.20 per Common Share. 

On
November 2, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all of the
assets of 901 Vaping Company LLC ( 901 Vaping ), an
E-liquid manufacturer, including all of the rights and title to own
and operate the Craft Vapes, Craft Clouds and Miss
Pennysworth s Elixirs E-liquid brands (the  CV
Brands ). Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, dated
October 21, 2015, the Company (i) issued to the vendor 1,000,000
Common Shares of the Company valued at $0.15 per share for a total
value of $150,000; (ii) paid cash consideration equal to 901
Vaping s inventory and equipment of $23,207; and (iii) agreed
to a quarterly-earn out based on the gross profit stream derived
from product sales of the CV Brands commencing on the closing date
up to a maximum of 25% of the gross profit stream. 

On December 2, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all of
the assets of The Mad Alchemist, LLC (  TMA ), an
E-liquid manufacturer, including the assets, rights and title to
own and operate The Mad Alchemist and Replicant E-liquid brands
(the  TMA Brands ), pursuant to an asset purchase
agreement dated November 30, 2015. The total purchase price for the
assets was $500,000 including the issuance of (i) 819,672 Common
Shares valued at $0.122 per share for a total value of $100,000;
(ii) $400,000 in cash payable in 10 equal payments of $20,000 in
cash and $20,000 in Common Shares every 3 months following the
closing date; and (iii) agreed to a quarterly-earn out based on the
gross profit stream derived from product sales of the TMA Brands
commencing on the closing date up to a maximum of 25% of the gross
profit stream. 

The
current business of the Company consists of the manufacturing,
marketing and distribution of generic and premium branded E-liquid,
which is the liquid used in vaporizers, E-cigarettes, and other
vaping hardware and accessories. E-liquid is heated by the atomizer
to deliver the sensation of smoking. Gilla s product
portfolio includes Coil Glaze, The Drip Factory, Surf Sauce, Siren,
VaporLiq, Vapor s Dozen, Craft Vapes, Craft Clouds, Vape
Warriors, Miss Pennysworth s Elixirs, The Mad Alchemist,
Replicant and Crown E-liquid brands. 

2. GOING CONCERN 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. As shown in these unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements, at September 30, 2016,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $12,192,015 and a working
capital deficiency of $5,578,070 as well as negative cash flows
from operating activities of $1,804,933 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016. These conditions represent material
uncertainty that cast significant doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving a
profitable level of operations or on the ability of the Company to
obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Management
believes that the Company will not be able to continue as a going
concern for the next twelve months without additional financing or
increased revenues. 

To meet
these objectives, the Company continues to seek other sources of
financing in order to support existing operations and expand the
range and scope of its business. However, there are no assurances
that any such financing can be obtained on acceptable terms and in
a timely manner, if at all. Failure to obtain the necessary working
capital would have a material adverse effect on the business
prospects and, depending upon the shortfall, the Company may have
to curtail or cease its operations. 

7 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do
not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company have to curtail
operations or be unable to continue in existence. 

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for complete consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a
full year. These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

The accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Outlined below are those policies considered particularly
significant: 

(a) 

  Basis of
Consolidation 

These
condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Gilla
Operations, LLC ( Gilla Operations ); E Vapor Labs
Inc.; E-Liq World, LLC; Charlie s Club, Inc.
( Charlie s Club ); Gilla Enterprises Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiary Gilla Europe Kft.; Gilla Operations
Worldwide Limited ( Gilla Worldwide ); Gilla
Franchises, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary Legion of Vape,
LLC.; and Snoke Distribution Canada Ltd. and its wholly owned
subsidiary Snoke Distribution USA, LLC. All inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in preparing these condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. 

(b) 

  Advertising
Costs 

In
accordance with ASC 720, the Company expenses the production costs
of advertising the first time the advertising takes place. The
Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. During the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed
$223,597 (September 30, 2015: $159,236) as corporate promotions,
these amounts have been recorded as administrative
expense. 

(c) 

  Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting pronouncements and other than the below, does not expect
the future adoption of any such pronouncements to have a
significant impact on its results of operations, financial
condition or cash flow. 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ),
requiring an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in
exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will supersede
nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP
when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers , deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09
by one year, and thus, the new standard will be effective for us
beginning on February 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted on or
after February 1, 2017. This standard may be adopted using either
the full or modified retrospective methods. Management of the
Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of
this standard on the consolidated financial
statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU
2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of
deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of
deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and
noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of
financial position. The amendments in the update require that all
deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in
the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or
retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is
permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating
adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the
consolidated financial statements. 

8 

On
February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2016-02 ,
Leases (Topic 842).  This update will require organizations
that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and
liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The new guidance will also require additional disclosures about the
amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have
on the Company s financial position and results of
operations. 

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation 
 (Topic 718).  This update
requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising
from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax
expense or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also
states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with
other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition,
an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to
either estimate the number of awards expected to vest or account
for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial
statements. 

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 (Topic 606),   Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies
the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance
obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while
retaining the related principles for those areas. The provisions of
this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this
standard will have on its financial statements. 

In May
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) ,  Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU
2016-12 ). The core principal of ASU 2016-12 is the
recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services.  The provisions of this update are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this
standard will have on its financial statements. 

In June
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses
(Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ), which requires
financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net
amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is
a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis.
The measurement of expected losses is based upon historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are
evaluating the guidance and have not yet determined the impact on
our consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No.
2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) 
( ASU 2016-15 ), which clarifies how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. Among other clarifications, the guidance
requires that cash proceeds received from the settlement of
corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies be classified as
cash inflows from investing activities and that cash payments for
premiums on COLI policies may be classified as cash outflows for
investing activities, operating activities or a combination of
both. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
Retrospective application is required. We are evaluating the
guidance and do not expect it to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

(a) On
July 1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued
and outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs, a Florida based E-liquid
manufacturer. The Company purchased E Vapor Labs in order to
procure an E-liquid manufacturing platform allowing the Company to
secure large private label contracts as well as manufacture its own
brands going forward. The following summarizes the fair value of
the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the consideration
transferred at the acquisition date: 

In
consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the vendors,
$225,000 in cash on closing and $900,000 in unsecured promissory
notes issued on the closing (collectively, the  Promissory
Notes ). The Promissory Notes were issued in three equal
tranches of $300,000 due four (4), nine (9) and eighteen (18)
months respectfully from the closing (individually,
 Promissory Notes A ,  Promissory Notes B ,
and  Promissory Notes C  respectively). The Promissory
Notes are all unsecured, non-interest bearing, and on the maturity
date, at the option of the vendors, up to one third (1/3) of each
tranche of the Promissory Notes can be repaid in Common Shares of
the Company, calculated using the 5 day weighted average closing
market price of the Company prior to the maturity of the Promissory
Notes. The Promissory Notes, are all and each subject to
adjustments as outlined in the share purchase agreement (the
 SPA ), dated June 25, 2015. 

At
December 31, 2015, the Company adjusted the Promissory Notes A for
$116,683 which is the known difference in the working capital
balance at closing of the acquisition from the amount specified in
the SPA. Further, a 12% discount rate has been used to calculate
the present value of the Promissory Notes based on the
Company s estimate of cost of financing for comparable notes
with similar term and risk profiles. Over the term of the
respective Promissory Notes, interest will be accrued at 12% per
annum to accrete the Promissory Notes to their respective principal
amounts. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the
Company recorded $23,246 in interest expense related to the
accretion of the Promissory Notes. The present value of the
Promissory Notes was $774,937 (December 31, 2015: $763,050) at
September 30, 2016. 

The
Promissory Notes A were due on November 1, 2015. The Company
provided notice to the Promissory Note holders on October 30, 2015
indicating its intention to repay such Promissory Notes, however,
such inability to accurately determine the required adjustments
pursuant to the SPA has forced the Company to defer repayment of
such Promissory Notes until such time where the principal amount of
the Promissory Notes can be accurately determined (note
17). 

10 

Intangible assets
consist primarily of customer relationships and brands. Brand
intangibles represents the estimated fair value of the trade names
acquired. Customer relationship intangibles relates to the ability
to sell existing and future products to E Vapor Lab s
existing and potential customers. The estimated useful life and
fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are as
follows: 

The
results of operations of E Vapor Labs have been included in the
interim condensed consolidated statements of operations from the
acquisition date. The following table presents pro forma results of
operations of the Company and E Vapor Labs as if the companies had
been combined as of January 1, 2015. The pro forma condensed
combined financial information is presented for informational
purposes only. The unaudited pro forma results of operations are
not necessarily indicative of results that would have occurred had
the acquisition taken place at the beginning of the earliest period
presented, or of future results. 

(b) On
July 14, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued

debenture units (the  Convertible Debenture Units
No.2 ) for proceeds of $375,000. Each Convertible Debenture
Unit No.2 consisted of an unsecured subordinated convertible
debenture having a principal amount of $1,000 (the
 Convertible Debentures No.3 ) and warrants exercisable
for the purchase of 10,000 Common Shares of the Company (note
14(n)). The Convertible Debentures No.3 mature on January 31, 2018
and bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum, which is payable
quarterly in arrears. The Convertible Debentures No.3 are
convertible into Common Shares of the Company at a fixed conversion
rate of $0.10 per share at any time prior to the maturity date. The
Company will have the option to force conversion of the Convertible
Debentures No.3 at any time after six months from issuance and
prior to the maturity date of January 31, 2018. For Canadian
purchasers, the Company may only force conversion of the
Convertible Debentures No.3 at such time that the Company is a
reporting issuer within the jurisdiction of Canada. Of the $375,000
Convertible Debentures No.3 issued, $55,000 were issued in
settlement of amounts owing to related parties (note 16), and
$10,000 were issued in settlement of amounts owing to an employee.
The Company incurred costs of $22,725 as a result of the
Convertible Debentures No.3. 

The
Company evaluated the terms and conditions of the Convertible
Debentures, Convertible Debentures No.2 and Convertible Debentures
No. 3 under the guidance of ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging . The conversion
feature met the definition of conventional convertible for purposes
of applying the conventional convertible exemption. The definition
of conventional contemplates a limitation on the number of shares
issuable under the arrangement. The instrument was convertible into
a fixed number of shares and there were no down round protection
features contained in the contracts. 

18 

Since a
portion of the Convertible Debentures, Convertible Debentures No.2
and Convertible Debentures No. 3 were issued as an exchange of
nonconvertible instruments at the nonconvertible instruments
maturity date, the guidance of ASC 470-20-30-19   20 was
applied. The fair value of the newly issued Convertible Debentures
was equal to the redemption amounts owed at the maturity date of
the original instruments. Therefore there was no gain or loss on
extinguishment of debt recorded. After the exchange occurred, the
Company was required to consider whether the new hybrid contracts
embodied a beneficial conversion feature
( BCF ). 

For the
face value $425,000 Convertible Debentures that were issued on
September 3, 2013, the calculation of the effective conversion
amount did not result in a BCF because the effective conversion
price was greater than the Company s stock price on the date
of issuance, therefore no BCF was recorded. However, for the face
value $797,000 Convertible Debentures that were issued on December
23, 2013 and the face value $178,000 Convertible Debentures that
were issued on February 11, 2014, the calculation of the effective
conversion amount did result in a BCF because the effective
conversion price was less than the Company s stock price on
the date of issuance and a BCF in the amounts of $797,000 and
$178,000, respectively, were recorded in additional paid-in
capital. The BCF results in a debt discount which is accreted over
the life of the loan using the effective interest rate. For the
three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded interest expense in the amount of $17,342 (September 30,
2015: $109,558 and $197,167) related to debt discount. 

For the
face value $650,000 Convertible Debenture Units, the relative fair
value of the warrants included in the Convertible Debenture Units
of $287,757 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The resulting fair value of the Convertible Debentures No.2
was calculated to be $362,243. The calculation of the effective
conversion resulted in a BCF because the effective conversion price
was less than the Company s stock price on the date of
issuance and a BCF in the amount of $133,657 was recorded in
additional paid-in capital. The BCF and the fair value of the
warrants, which represents debt discount, is accreted over the life
of the loan using the effective interest rate. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded interest
expense in the amount of $14,483 and $27,613 (September 30, 2015:
nil) related to debt discount. 

For the
face value $375,000 Debenture Units No.2, the relative fair value
of the warrants included in the Convertible Debenture Units No.2 of
$234,737 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The resulting fair value of the Convertible Debentures No.3
was calculated to be $140,263. The calculation of the effective
conversion resulted in a BCF because the effective conversion price
was less than the Company s stock price on the date of
issuance and a BCF in the amount of $117,538, which is net of
transaction costs, was recorded in additional paid-in capital. The
BCF and the fair value of the warrants, which represents debt
discount, is accreted over the life of the loan using the effective
interest rate. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded interest expense in the amount of $5,411
and $11,225 (September 30, 2015: nil) related to debt
discount. 

Since
issuance of the Convertible Debenture Units and Convertible
Debenture Units No.2, the Company has accreted $34,113 and $11,225,
respectively, related to discount for a total amount of $45,338
which has been recorded as a long term liability on the balance
sheet. 

The
Company received forms of election whereby holders of the
Convertible Debentures elected to convert into Common Shares of the
Company at $0.07 per share pursuant to the terms of the Convertible
Debentures. As at September 30, 2016, the Company received the
following forms of elections from holders of the Convertible
Debentures: 

On
January 25, 2016, the Company received a form of election to
convert $23,000 of Convertible Debentures, such Common Shares
remain unissued. On March 10, 2016, the Company settled $25,000 in
principal of the outstanding Convertible Debentures with a cash
payment. On September 30, 2016, the Company was in default on the
remaining $50,000 of the Convertible Debentures that matured as of
January 31, 2016. On July 6, 2016, the Company settled the
remaining $50,000 in principal of the Convertible Debentures and
agreed to pay to the holders such principal in monthly payments
ending on November 1, 2016.

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

(i)
Credit Risk 

Credit
risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or
counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations. The Company s credit risk is
primarily attributable to fluctuations in the realizable values of
its cash and trade receivable. Cash accounts are maintained with
major international financial institutions of reputable credit and
therefore bear minimal credit risk. In the normal course of
business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers
and the related accounts receivable are subject to normal
commercial credit risks. A substantial portion of the
Company s accounts receivable are concentrated with a limited
number of large customers all of which the Company believes are
subject to normal industry credit risks. At September 30, 2016, the
Company booked an allowance of bad debt of $20,615 (December 31,
2015: $20,370) in regards customers with past due
amounts.   For
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, 73% (December 31,
2015: 38%) of the Company s trade receivables are due from
one customer and 81% of the trade receivables are due from two
customers. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016,
27% of the Company s sales were to one customer and 54% of
the Company s sales were from three customers. 

(ii)
Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its
financial obligations as they fall due. The Company s
approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as
possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions,
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the
Company s reputation. The Company manages liquidity risk by
closely monitoring changing conditions in its investees,
participating in the day to day management and by forecasting cash
flows from operations and anticipated investing and financing
activities. At September 30, 2016, the Company had liabilities due
to unrelated parties through its financial obligations over the
next five years in the aggregate principal amount of $5,875,194
(December 31, 2015: $1,987,967). Of such amount, the Company has
obligations to repay $4,698,032 over the next twelve months with
the remaining $1,177,162 becoming due within the following four
year period. 

28 

(iii) Foreign
Currency Risk 

Currency
risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a
financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign
exchange rates.  The risks and
fluctuations are related to cash and accounts payable and accrued
liabilities that are denominated in CAD and
HUF.  

Analysis by currency in Canadian and Hungarian equivalents is as
follows: 

The
effect of a 10% strengthening of the United States dollar against
the Canadian dollar and Hungarian Forint at the reporting date on
the CAD and HUF-denominated trade receivables and payables carried
at that date would, had all other variables held constant, have
resulted in an increase in profit for the year and increase of net
assets of $17,114 and $19,952, respectively. A 10% weakening in the
exchange rate would, on the same basis, have decreased profit and
decreased net assets by $17,114 and $19,952, respectively. During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, amounts denominated
in Euros were minimal and did not subject the Company to
significant currency risk. 

The
Company purchases inventory in a foreign currency, at September 30,
2016, the Company included $191,495 (December 31, 2015: $146) in
inventory purchased in a foreign currency on its condensed
consolidated interim balance sheet. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to this
risk. 

(iv)
Interest Rate Risk 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a
financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its
fixed interest rate financial instruments. These fixed-rate
instruments subject the Company to a fair value risk. The interest
rates on all of the Company s existing interest bearing debt
are fixed. Sensitivity to a plus or minus 25 basis points change in
rates would not significantly affect the fair value of this
debt.

Acquisition of E Vapor Labs 

On July
1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and
outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs Inc. ( E Vapor
Labs ), a Florida based E-liquid manufacturer. The Company
purchased E Vapor Labs in order to procure an E-liquid
manufacturing platform allowing the Company to secure large private
label contracts as well as manufacture its own brands going
forward. The following summarizes the fair value of the assets
acquired, liabilities assumed and the consideration transferred at
the acquisition date: 

In
consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the vendors,
$225,000 in cash on closing and $900,000 in unsecured promissory
notes issued on the closing (collectively, the  Promissory
Notes ). The Promissory Notes were issued in three equal
tranches of $300,000 due four (4), nine (9) and eighteen (18)
months respectfully from the closing (individually,
 Promissory Notes A ,  Promissory Notes B ,
and  Promissory Notes C  respectively). The Promissory
Notes are all unsecured, non-interest bearing, and on the maturity
date, at the option of the vendors, up to one third (1/3) of each
tranche of the Promissory Notes can be repaid in Common Shares of
the Company, calculated using the 5 day weighted average closing
market price of the Company prior to the maturity of the Promissory
Notes. The Promissory Notes, are all and each subject to
adjustments as outlined in the share purchase agreement (the
 SPA ), dated June 25, 2015. 

At
December 31, 2015, the Company adjusted the Promissory Notes A for
$116,683 which is the known difference in the working capital
balance at closing of the acquisition from the amount specified in
the SPA. Further, a 12% discount rate has been used to calculate
the present value of the Promissory Notes based on the
Company s estimate of cost of financing for comparable notes
with similar term and risk profiles. Over the term of the
respective Promissory Notes, interest will be accrued at 12% per
annum to accrete the Promissory Notes to their respective principal
amounts. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the
Company recorded $23,246 in interest expense related to the
accretion of the Promissory Notes. The present value of the
Promissory Notes was $774,937 (December 31, 2015: $763,050) at
September 30, 2016. 

The
Promissory Notes A were due on November 1, 2015. The Company
provided notice to the Promissory Note holders on October 30, 2015
indicating its intention to repay such Promissory Notes, however,
such inability to accurately determine the required adjustments
pursuant to the SPA has forced the Company to defer repayment of
such Promissory Notes until such time where the principal amount of
the Promissory Notes can be accurately determined.

principal together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
shall be due and payable. The Company shall also repay 5% of the
initial principal amount of Loan Tranche A and 5% of Loan Tranche
B, monthly in arrears, with the first principal repayment beginning
on June 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $408,646 of the amounts
owing on the Loan Agreement have been recorded as current
liabilities to reflect the monthly principal payments due over the
next year. The Company may elect to repay the outstanding principal
of the Shareholder Loan together with all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon prior to maturity without premium or penalty. The
Company also agreed to service the Shareholder Loan during the term
prior to making any payments to the Company s Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Board of Directors. The
Shareholder Loan is secured by a general security agreement over
the assets of the Company. 

39 

The
Company accrued interest of $7,759 and $15,894 during the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 (September 30, 2015:
nil), respectively, on the Shareholder Loan. Accrued interest owing
on the Shareholder Loan at September 30, 2016 is $16,044 (December
31, 2015: nil) which is included in accrued liabilities. At
September 30, 2016, the Company owes the lender $102,162 in
principal payments. 

Convertible Debentures 

On May
20, 2016, the Company issued 375 unsecured subordinated convertible
debenture units (the  Convertible Debenture Units
No.2 ) for proceeds of $375,000. Each Convertible Debenture
Unit No.2 consisted of an unsecured subordinated convertible
debenture having a principal amount of $1,000 (the
 Convertible Debentures No.3 ) and warrants exercisable
for the purchase of 10,000 Common Shares of the Company. The
Convertible Debentures No.3 mature on January 31, 2018 and bear
interest at a rate of 8% per annum, which is payable quarterly in
arrears. The Convertible Debentures No.3 are convertible into
Common Shares of the Company at a fixed conversion rate of $0.10
per share at any time prior to the maturity date. The Company will
have the option to force conversion of the Convertible Debentures
No.3 at any time after six months from issuance and prior to the
maturity date of January 31, 2018. For Canadian purchasers, the
Company may only force conversion of the Convertible Debentures
No.3 at such time that the Company is a reporting issuer within the
jurisdiction of Canada. Of the $375,000 Convertible Debentures No.3
issued, $55,000 were issued in settlement of amounts owing to
related parties, and $10,000 were issued in settlement of amounts
owing to an employee. The Company incurred costs of $22,725 as a
result of the Convertible Debentures No.3. 

Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12
Months 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. As shown in these unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements, at September 30, 2016,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $12,192,015 and a working
capital deficiency of $5,578,070 as well as negative cash flows
from operating activities of $1,804,933 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016. These conditions represent material
uncertainty that cast significant doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving a
profitable level of operations or on the ability of the Company to
obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Management
believes that the Company will not be able to continue as a going
concern for the next twelve months without additional financing or
increased revenues. 

To meet
these objectives, the Company continues to seek other sources of
financing in order to support existing operations and expand the
range and scope of its business. However, there are no assurances
that any such financing can be obtained on acceptable terms and in
a timely manner, if at all. Failure to obtain the necessary working
capital would have a material adverse effect on the business
prospects and, depending upon the shortfall, the Company may have
to curtail or cease its operations. 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do
not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company have to curtail
operations or be unable to continue in existence. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting pronouncements and other than the below, does not expect
the future adoption of any such pronouncements to have a
significant impact on its results of operations, financial
condition or cash flow.

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), requiring an entity
to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services. ASU 2014-09 will supersede nearly all existing revenue
recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers ,
deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year, and thus,
the new standard will be effective for us beginning on February 1,
2018 with early adoption permitted on or after February 1, 2017.
This standard may be adopted using either the full or modified
retrospective methods. Management of the Company is currently
evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the
consolidated financial statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU
2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of
deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of
deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and
noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of
financial position. The amendments in the update require that all
deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in
the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or
retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is
permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating
adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the
consolidated financial statements. 

On
February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This update will
require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance
sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations
created by those leases. The new guidance will also require
additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of
cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of this ASU will have on the Company s financial
position and results of operations. 

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic
718) . This update requires that all excess tax benefits and
tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be
recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income
statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits
should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an
operating activity. In addition, an entity can make an entity-wide
accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards
expectedto vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The
provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on
its financial statements. 

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) ,  Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU
2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of
Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for
those areas. The provisions of this update are effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial
statements. 

In May
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) ,  Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU
2016-12 ). The core principal of ASU 2016-12 is the
recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. The provisions of this update are effective for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with
early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial
statements. 

In June
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses
(Topic 326) ,  Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU
2016-13 ), which requires financial assets measured at
amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be
collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account
that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The measurement of
expected losses is based upon historical experience, current
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect
the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with
early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the guidance and have
not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No.
2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230) ,  Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the
Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ),
which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are
presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. Among
other clarifications, the guidance requires that cash proceeds
received from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance
(COLI) policies be classified as cash inflows from investing
activities and that cash payments for premiums on COLI policies may
be classified as cash outflows for investing activities, operating
activities or a combination of both. The guidance is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. Retrospective application is required. We are evaluating
the guidance and do not expect it to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for complete consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a
full year. These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

The
accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Outlined below are those policies considered particularly
significant: 

Basis of Consolidation 

These
condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Gilla
Operations, LLC ( Gilla Operations ); E Vapor Labs
Inc.; E-Liq World, LLC; Charlie s Club, Inc.
( Charlie s Club ); Gilla Enterprises Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiary Gilla Europe Kft.; Gilla Operations
Worldwide Limited ( Gilla Worldwide ); Gilla
Franchises, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary Legion of Vape,
LLC.; and Snoke Distribution Canada Ltd. and its wholly owned
subsidiary Snoke Distribution USA, LLC. All inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in preparing these condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. 

Advertising Costs 

In
accordance with ASC 720, the Company expenses the production costs
of advertising the first time the advertising takes place. The
Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. During the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed
$223,597 (September 30, 2015: $159,236) as corporate promotions,
these amounts have been recorded as administrative
expense. 

ITEM 3.   
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

This
item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4.    DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the
definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ). 

As of
the end of the period covered by this Report, and under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this
evaluation, we believe that disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of June 30, 2016, due to our limited resources and
staff. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial
Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion
of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
January 5, 2016, Yaron Elkayam, Pinchas Mamane and Levent Dikmen
filed a three count complaint against the Company in the Circuit
Court of Hillsborough County, Florida alleging (i) breach of
contract, (ii) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and (iii) fraud in the inducement seeking damages in the
amount of approximately $900,000 of Promissory Notes issued on July
1, 2015 as a result of the acquisition of E Vapor Labs. On February
23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on
the basis of failure to allege sufficient jurisdictional facts and
failure to satisfy constitutional due process requirements to
exercise jurisdiction. There can be no assurance that the outcome
of this complaint would not have a material adverse effect on the
business, results of operations and financial condition. The legal
proceeding has been brought in Circuit Court of the Thirteenth
Judicial Circuit in and for Hillsborough County, State of Florida,
Civil Division under the following caption: Yaron Elkayam, Pinchas
Mamane, Levent Dikmen, Plaintiffs, v. Gilla, Inc., Case No.

from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

ITEM
2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND
USE OF PROCEEDS
