EARTH GEN-BIOFUEL, INC.  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

Note 1 Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation  

Earth Gen-Biofuel, Inc. (the  Company  or  Earth
Gen ) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 28, 2012 to pursue the business of becoming an international agricultural
company focused on growing plants that are the basis for providing renewable sources for manufacturing processes and energy. 

On September 25, 2012, Earth Gen entered into an Agreement of
Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization (the  Exchange Agreement ) with EarthBlock Technologies, Inc. ( EarthBlock ),
a Nevada publicly traded corporation, pursuant to which EarthBlock acquired 100% of the ownership of the Company in exchange for
63,666,400 shares of EarthBlock s common stock (the  Exchange ) on the basis of four shares of EarthBlock for
one share of Earth Gen outstanding as of October 14, 2012. 

Upon the completion of the Exchange, Earth Gen operated as a
wholly owned subsidiary of EarthBlock and focused its efforts to begin its international agricultural operations. In October of
2012, Earth Gen began to organize farmers and government related agencies in Laos and Vietnam to control land for growing castor
beans. Prior to Earth Gen becoming a subsidiary of EarthBlock, Earth Gen s management had spent over two years creating the
relationships and working with local farmers to build an organization and obtain the knowledge and expertise to become a major
grower of castor beans in these countries. 

The common stock of EarthBlock was registered with the SEC under
the Exchange Act and was quoted on OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. EarthBlock failed to comply with Exchange Act Section
13(a) because it had not filed any periodic reports with the SEC since the period ended December 31, 2007. EarthBlock consented
to a deregistration order of the SEC, and pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, registration of EarthBlock s common
stock was revoked and trading in EarthBlock s common stock was suspended. 

Additionally, the shareholders of Earth Gen were not made aware
of the full extent of a material liability of EarthBlock that resulted from the operations of EarthBlock s non-operational
subsidiary EarthBlock Texas Homes, Inc. As a result of the liability not being included in proper detail and information regarding
its effect on EarthBlock s financial statements, EarthBlock s previously disclosed financial condition was inaccurate. 

On September 25, 2013, the Board of Directors of EarthBlock
and of Earth Gen voted to rescind the acquisition of Earth Gen by EarthBlock and authorized the officers of the Corporation to
take the steps required to complete the rescission of the Exchange. 

A rescission agreement dated October 28, 2013 (the  Rescission
Agreement ) was entered into by and among EarthBlock, Earth Gen and the shareholders. A majority of Earth Gen shareholders
approved the Rescission Agreement on October 28, 2013. The Rescission Agreement sets forth the terms and provisions where the parties
agreed to take all steps necessary and proper to unwind the Exchange including the surrender of the Exchange Shares for cancellation
and Earth Gen to issue to each Exchange Share shareholder his respective original equity interests in Earth Gen. The Additional
Shares will remain outstanding and will ratably dilute the Exchange Share shareholders pre-Exchange, original equity ownership
in Earth Gen as a result. 

The Rescission Agreement offer terminated on October 10, 2014.
Pursuant to the terms of the Rescission Agreement, Earth Gen issued a total of 50,645,600 Earth Gen common stock shares to participating
holders of Exchange Shares commensurate with the holders  respective original equity interests in Earth Gen. Earth Gen also
issued a total of 7,030,400 Additional Shares. No additional Earth Gen common stock shares will be issued as a result of the rescission
of the Reverse Merger. One Shareholder owning 7,560,000 Exchange Shares did not become a party to the Rescission Agreement and
will retain his EarthBlock common stock shares and with no equity interest in Earth Gen. 

In March 2014, Earth Gen-Biofuel Lao Sole Co Ltd ( Earth
Gen Laos ) was formed under the laws of Laos to meet Laos s regulatory and legal requirements to do business in Laos.
This company is 100% controlled by Earth Gen. Earth Gen Laos has its own in-country bank accounts denominated in US dollars through
which it pays all local operating expenses of the business activities of Earth Gen in Laos. 

In March of 2016, Earth-Eco Agriculture Inc. ( Earth-Eco )
was formed as a Nevada corporation and 100% owned subsidiary of Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. There were no operation of Earth-Eco Agriculture
since June 30, 2016. Earth-Eco Agriculture Inc. was formed for the management of Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc s non-castor bean
operations. 

Note 2 Going Concern  

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit since inception. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify future investment opportunities
and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company s future operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information  

These unaudited interim financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The balance sheets and certain comparative
information as of December 31, 2015 are derived from the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December
31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual Financial Statements ), included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These
unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 Annual Financial Statements. 

Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share  

Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company s
net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted loss per
share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number
of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted loss per share excludes all dilutive potential shares if
their effect is anti-dilutive. 

The Company has issued common stock purchase warrants and entered
into convertible note; however, they are anti-dilutive given the net loss incurred for the periods presented. As a result, 4,902,500
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (presented post-dividend and post-split) were excluded from the calculation of diluted
loss per common share as of June 30, 2016. Therefore, dilutive and basic losses per common share are equal. 

Inventory  

Inventory consists of raw materials consisting of castor bean
seeds. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost is determined at the
actual cost for raw materials. 

Expenditures on growing crops are valued at the lower of cost
or market and are deferred and charged to cost of sales when the related crops are harvested and sold. The deferred growing costs
included in inventories in the balance sheets consist primarily of land rental cost and service costs. 

In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, the management
makes judgments as to future demand requirements compared to current or committed inventory levels. The Company s reserve
requirements generally increase or decrease with its projected demand requirements and market conditions. The Company estimates
the demand requirements based on market conditions, forecasts prepared by its customers, sales contracts and orders in hand. 

In addition, the Company estimates net realizable value based
on intended use, current market value and inventory aging analyses. The Company writes down the inventories for estimated obsolescence
or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. 

Based on the above assessment,
the Company recorded an inventory reserve of $56,931 and $115,963   as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Timber Rights  

Timber rights represent the exclusive rights acquired by the
Company to extract and purchase all commercial timber logs extractable from a designated timber concession area. 

Timber rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization
and impairment loss, if any. 

The timber harvested are depleted on the basis of the volume
of timber logs extracted during the year as a proportion of the total estimated timber logs extractable over the remaining period
of timber extraction. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue from sales of the Company s products is recognized
upon customer acceptance, which occurs at the time of delivery to the customer, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, such as signed sales contract, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer at the
time when the products are delivered to its customers with no significant post-delivery obligation on our part, the sales price
is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company does not provide its customers with contractual rights
of return and post-delivery discount for any of its products. When there is any significant post-delivery performance obligations
exists, revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled. The Company evaluates the terms of sales agreement with
its customers in order to determine whether any significant post-delivery performance obligations exist. 

Note 4 Inventory  

Inventory consists of: 

Note 5  Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment consist of: 

For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, depreciation
expenses were $1,924 and $1,924, respectively. 

Note 6  Timber Rights  

On March 16, 2016, Earth-Eco purchased the rights to all products
derived from Phonehong Tree Farms, a farm located in the Laos People s Democratic Republic. The farm covers nearly 27 acres
and has approximately 9,000 Aguilaria trees, which are cultivated to produce Agarwood. According to the purchase agreement, Phonehong
Tree Farms assigned the rights to all Agarwood trees on the land and the future rights to all products grown on the land for a
period of 40 years to Earth-Eco. In exchange for the rights, Earth Gen issued 2,500,000 shares of its restricted common stock to
the owner of Phonehong Tree Farms. The shares were valued at $625,000 which was the fair value of the stock at the time of entering
the purchasing agreement. 

Note 7  Due from/to Related Parties  

The Company and EarthBlock advanced each other monies in the
normal course of business. The advances do not have written note, do not accrued interest and are due on demand. There have been
no new advances. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a full reserve of $58,058. 

On June 22, 2016, amount owed to George Shen of $43,566 was
converted to 622,373 shares of the Company s common stocks. The accrued salary was converted to  Restricted 
Common stock at a price of $0.07 per share. At the time of the exchange of stock for the accrued salary the stock was trading in
the open market at $0.10 per share. The agreement with Mr. Shen to issue of shares to eliminate the accrued salary owed to him
set the price of the debt exchange at a 30% discount to the market. The $0.07 price was equivalent to shares issued to funds received
at that time in a private placement from third parties. Because the shares were issued at a discount to market to eliminate the
accrued salary it added to the reported losses recorded in the period ended June 30, 2016. As a result, as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company owed $0 and $19,444 to George Shen, CEO and shareholder of the Company for accrued service fees
and monies advanced to and repaid by the Company in the normal course of business. The advances do not have written note, do not
accrue interest and are due on demand. 

Prior to September 30, 2013, the Company was provided office
space at no charge by George Shen. Starting July 1, 2013, the Company has been paying office rent at $3,360 under a month-to-month
lease agreement and is now paying $3,495 per month. Starting in February 2016, the Company has sub-leased part of the office space
to a company in which George Shen is also a shareholder. 

The Company obtained short-term loans from
a company in which George Shen is also an officer and from certain shareholders for working capital purposes. 

Promissory note from related parties consists of: 

For the over-due promissory notes, there has
been no demand for repayment. 

On June 24, 2016, a related party promissory
note of $33,475 was converted to 478,214 shares of the Company s common stocks. The $33,475 promissory note was converted
to  Restricted  Common stock at a price of $0.07 per share. At the time of the debt exchange for stock, the stock was
trading in the open market at $0.10 per share. The exchange agreement called for shares to eliminate the debt to be issued at a
30% discount to the quoted market. The $0.07 price was equivalent to shares issued to funds received at that time in a private
placement from third parties. Because the shares were issued at a discount to market to eliminate the accrued salary it added to
the reported losses recorded in the period ended June 30, 2016 

Note 8  Notes Payable  

The Company obtained short-term loans from an unrelated party
for working capital purposes. 

Note payable consists of: 

On June 22, 2016, the promissory note of $3,500 and accrued
interest on the note were converted to 51,449 shares of the Company s common stocks.

note. The convertible note bears interest at 2% per annum, due July 30, 2015, convertible into common stock of the Company anytime

from and including such due date, on a cumulative, compounding basis. On June 27, 2016, the Company s board of directors
authorized the conversion of the convertible note along with accrued interest on the note to 107,154 shares of its common stocks. 

On October 29, 2014, the Company issued a $36,000 convertible
note. The convertible note bears interest at 5% per annum, due December 15, 2015, convertible into common stock of the Company
anytime after May 15, 2015 at a conversion price of $0.07 per share. If the outstanding balance of the convertible note is not

The Company calculated $63,000 for the intrinsic value of the
beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ) of the convertible notes (based on the last sale price of $0.15 per share) and
recorded the $63,000 BCF as a debt discount and as an addition to additional paid-in capital on effective date of the notes. The
debt discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the note. The BCF has been fully amortized since December
31, 2015.

At June 30, 2016, the Company is authorized
to issue 690,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock and 10,000,000 of $0.0001 par value preferred stock.

with EarthBlock and to prevent dilution to existing shareholders of the Company, on October 15, 2013, the board of directors of
the Company approved a stock dividend of three shares for each outstanding share. The stock dividend is being treated as a stock

issued warrants to purchase 6,000,000 shares of Earth Gen common stock on April 26, 2015. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase
one (1) share of Earth Gen common stock at $0.07 per share starting on May 1, 2015 and ending on March 31, 2016. 

In connection with a consulting agreement, the Company issued
warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of Earth Gen common stock on December 12, 2015 as compensation to the consultant. Each warrant
entitles the holder to purchase one (1) share of Earth Gen common stock at $0.07 per share starting on April 30, 2016 and ending
on December 15, 2017. The fair value of warrants granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes model and amortized over the vesting
period. At June 30, 2016, $18,518 was fully amortized to stock-based compensation expense. 

These warrants have standard anti-dilution language to allow
for recapitalizations and distributions. The warrants are equity classified and amounts attributable to the warrants are classified
within additional paid-in capital. All reference to numbers of shares issued for warrants and per share price is based on a post-stock-dividend
and post-reverse-split amount. 

A summary of the status of the Company s warrants outstanding
as of June 30, 2016 is presented below: 

The following table summarizes information about warrants outstanding
as of June 30, 2016:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

In this section,  Earth Gen,   we, 
 our,   ours,   us  and the  Company  refer to Earth Gen-Biofuel, Inc. You should
read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements
and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information
contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q consists of forward-looking
statements such as statements regarding our expectations about the trials, regulatory approval, manufacturing, distribution and
commercialization of our current and future product candidates and statements regarding our anticipated revenues, expenses, margins,
profits and use of cash. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words  anticipates,   believes,   expects, 
 intends,   future,   could,   estimates,   plans,   would, 
 should,   potential,   continues  and similar words or expressions (as well as other words
or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) often identify forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations.
These statements are not promises or guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors
that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: our limited operating history and expectations
of losses for the foreseeable future; the absence of revenue from our product candidates for the foreseeable future; our potential
inability to obtain any necessary additional financing; our substantial dependence on the success of our lead product candidates,
which may not be successfully commercialized even if they are approved for marketing; the effect of competition; our potential
inability to obtain regulatory approval for our existing or future product candidates; our dependence on third parties to conduct
some of our development activities; our dependence upon third-party manufacturers for supplies of our product candidates; uncertainties
regarding the outcomes of trials regarding our product candidates; our potential failure to attract and retain senior management
and key scientific personnel; uncertainty about our ability to develop a satisfactory sales organization; our significant costs
of operating as a public company; our potential inability to obtain patent protection and other intellectual property protection
for our product candidates; potential claims by third parties alleging our infringement of their patents and other intellectual
property rights; our potential failure to comply with regulatory requirements, which are subject to change on an ongoing basis;
the potential volatility of our stock price; and the significant control over our business by our principal stockholders and management. 

Overview  

Our primary business is the cultivation of non-food agricultural
products for use in manufacturing processes, renewable energy and transportation fuel. Currently, our focus is on the cultivation
of castor beans, an agricultural crop currently in high demand and short supply. Castor beans are an integral component in processing
manufactured products for many countries and have attracted attention as a  renewable energy crop  with great value
due to its high oil content in comparison to other oil seed crops. 

Our goal is to become a major producer of castor beans in Southeast
Asia and other tropical growing areas. Our business model is to supply the growing demand for castor beans by cultivating and growing
in areas not suitable for food crops. Our plan to use areas of relatively poor soil conditions allows us to produce castor beans
without competing with potentially more valuable products. 

We plan to build our business by providing castor beans to chemical
conversion facilities, which utilize chemical processes that require the use castor oil, in China and other countries such as Japan,
Taiwan, Europe and the United States. Furthermore, as the world supply of castor beans grows along with our own production, we
will benefit from a  tipping point  created when there is enough surplus castor bean supply to allow for its use as
biodiesel. Based on current commercial demand for castor bean oil, long term need for clean fuel, and favorable industry conditions
in China, the United States and Europe, we believe that, subject to obtaining the necessary capital, we are positioned for rapid
near and long term growth. 

Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. formed a new wholly owned subsidiary
Earth-Eco Agriculture Inc. ( Earth-Eco ) as a Nevada corporation on March 16, 2016. This new subsidiary was formed
to manage agricultural operations that are not Castor Bean related for its parent company Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. 

On March 16, 2016 Earth-Eco purchased the rights to the Agarwood
production from a 27-acre plantation in the Laos People s Democratic Republic containing over 9,000 mature  Aquilaria
trees for the production of  Agarwood. Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. issued 2,500,000 shares of  restricted  Common
stock to the Seller to complete the purchase. The shares were valued at $625,000. 

The Phonehong Tree Farm was not an operating business at the
time Earth-Eco purchased the rights to the tree production. Trees on the 26-acre land area were planted in 2006 and there have
been no operations since that time except an occasional effort to clear underbrush in the planted area. Aquilaria trees after 10
to 20 years are susceptible to a natural occurring virus that infects the tree and rots the core of tree. This rotten core is what
becomes the highly valued Agarwood. 

Going forward, Earth-Eco Agriculture Inc. will
be providing the working capital to start to commercialize the 26-acre Phonehong Tree farm. Active operations are planned to start
in September of 2016, after the rainy season. The process of introducing the Agarwood causing virus to the Aquilaria trees is planned
to start in September of 2016. In addition to a certain amount of farm infrastructure, there are plans to build housing for a limited
number of staff and equipment. It is expected that the Aquilaria trees will have developed enough Agarwood to start harvesting
operations in late 2018. The harvesting process will continue over a 4 to 5-year period. 

Results of Operations  

Our consolidated financial statements are stated in United States
Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). The discussion
of the results of our operations compares three and six months ended June 30, 2016 with the three and six months ended June 30,
2015, and is not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for any subsequent periods. Our prospects should be
considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in similar positions. We may not be successful
in addressing these risks and difficulties. 

Comparison of Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016
and 2015   

As of June 30, 2016, we have incurred significant losses from
operations, and at June 30, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $3,157,855 At June 30, 2016, we had $ 26,602 of cash and cash equivalents.
Since inception we raised an aggregate of approximately $3,044,743 in equity financing to fund our operations. Until such time
when we generate sufficient revenues from operations, we will continue to be dependent on raising substantial amounts of additional
capital through any one of a combination of debt or equity offerings. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional
capital when necessary or how much revenue will be obtained from our farming operations. 

The financial data for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, when
compared with the operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 reflect a different stage of the Company s development.
In the second quarter of 2015, the Company was finishing planting operations on some of the land it had under lease. Also the Company
was creating the infrastructure needed for farming operations in Southeast Asia. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
there were very limited planting operations in Laos. In the three and six months ending on June 30, 2016, operations consisted
of farm maintenance operations. 

Earth Gen s new subsidiary Earth-Eco was formed on March
16, 2016 and had no operations during the period ended June 30, 2016. This subsidiary s operations are focused on non-castor
bean businesses of the Company. Earth Gen issued 2,500,000 shares of restricted common stock to complete the acquisition of forestry
rights to a 27-acre farm that is cultivating Aquilaria trees for the production of Agarwood. The stock was valued at $625,000.
It is expected that during the balance of the 2016 Earth Gen will incur expenses in regard to maintaining the Aquilaria forest
and preparing to commercialize the operations. 

Operating Expenses  

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, general and
administrative expenses ( G A ) increased by $46,510 and $48,820 compared with the same periods in 2015. The increases
were mainly due to higher stock based compensation of $121,695 and $176,272, respectively, partly offset by decrease in consulting
fee of $37,487 and $74,657, respectively, and decrease in legal and professional fee of $33,130 and $36,717, respectively. The
decrease in consulting fees was mainly due to reduced staff and consultants in Laos during the maintenance phase of farm development. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our working capital for the periods presented is summarized
as follows: 

The following table shows cash flows for the periods presented: 

Operating Activities   

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in operating
activities was $109,252. This was primarily due to a net loss of $396,798, adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation
of $1,924, amortization of $3,906, inventory reserve of $56,931, stock-based compensation of $178,820 and loss on conversion to
common stock of $36,496, then increased by favorable changes in working capital of $9,469 The favorable changes in working capital
mainly resulted from an increase in related party payables of $23,833, partly offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued
expenses of $14,364. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net cash used in operating
activities was $238,742. This was primarily due to a net loss of $345,399 adjusted by non-cash related expenses including depreciation
of $1,924, and amortization of a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ) debt discount of $32,559, inventory reserve
of $59,032 and stock-based compensation of $2,548, then increased by favorable changes in working capital of $10,594. The favorable
changes in working capital mainly resulted from an increase in related party payables of $14,669 and an increase in accounts payable
and accrued expense of $13,925, offset by an increase in inventory of $18,000 in capitalized costs of growing crops. 

Financing activities   

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by
financing activities mainly resulted from common stock issued in private placements of $83,000 and net proceeds from related party
note payable of $51,475. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net cash provided by
financing activities mainly resulted from common stock issued in private placements of $233,600 and $9,000 proceeds from related
party note payable, offset by $3,000 net repayment for note payable. 

Equity Financings   

Since inception, Earth Gen s funding has been provided
by the sale of its common stock for cash. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company had proceeds from common stock issuances
of $63,000. The Company had total paid in capital of $3,157,855from inception to June 30, 2016. 

Cash Requirements  

Our primary objectives for the year 2016 period are to develop
and pursue the commercialization of our planned farming operations. We continuously search for industry experts to expand our management
team and better position our company. In addition, we expect to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations and to develop
additional farmland for cultivation of castor beans and provide support in the form of equipment and personnel to expand operations
and provide required working capital. 

We estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements
for the next 12 months to be approximately as follows: 

Historically our funding has been a mixture of private offerings
and debt. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26,602 and other current assets of $338,159.
Of these current assets, we have no specific time at when the Company will receive cash for the other current assets. 

The Company does not have a commitment for capital. The Company
believes that its current cash and expected net cash from operations will provide insufficient capital to cover expenses and debt
obligations for the next twelve-month period. The Company intends to use a combination of new equity investment, loans and cash
flow from operations to meet its operational needs. 

If working capital is not available in sufficient amounts, the
Company will be required to reduce the amount expended on new planting and new farm development to save working capital for operations
and to use expected future harvest cash flow for growth. The ability to obtain additional working capital from investors or from
future farm operations may not develop or be available when needed, which will interfere with planned operations and cause results
to vary based on these uncertainties. 

If we obtain additional financing by issuing equity securities,
our existing stockholders  ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available,
will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We may be unable to maintain operations at a level sufficient for investors
to obtain a return on their investments in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require
the most subjective and complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. However, we do not believe that there are any alternative methods of accounting for our operations that would have a
material effect on our financial statements. 

Inventory  

Expenditures on growing crops are valued at the lower of cost
or market and are deferred and charged to cost of sales when the related crops are harvested and sold. In assessing the ultimate
realization of inventories, the management makes judgments as to future demand requirements compared to current or committed inventory
levels. The Company s reserve requirements generally increase or decrease with its projected demand requirements and market
conditions. The Company estimates the demand requirements based on market conditions, forecasts prepared by its customers, sales
contracts and orders in hand. In addition, the Company estimates net realizable value based on intended use, current market value
and inventory ageing analyses. The Company writes down the inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal
to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. 

Property, Plant, and Equipment  

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Judgment
is required to determine the estimated useful lives of assets. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect
our financial position and results of operations. 

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets / Intangible Assets  

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting of
property and equipment, and finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carry value may
not be recoverable. Examples of such circumstances include: (1) loss of legal ownership or title to an asset; (2) significant changes
in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets; and (3) the impact of significant negative industry or economic
trends. 

Recoverability of assets to be held and used in operations is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets.
The factors used to evaluate the future net cash flows, while reasonable, require a high degree of judgment and the results could
vary if the actual results are materially different than the forecasts. In addition, we base useful lives and amortization or depreciation
expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us. If such assets
are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds
the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling
costs. 

We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible
assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows
from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material
change in our reported results would increase. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures . 

The term  disclosure controls and procedures  means
controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined) in Exchange Act
Rules 13a   15(c) and 15d   15(e)).  Based upon that evaluation, we concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the following material
weaknesses: 

1. Lack of segregation of duties and check
and balances. 

2. Lack of written controls and procedures,
particularly with regard to entering into contracts and commitments by the Company. 

3. Use of an accounting software package
that lacks a rigorous set of software and change controls.  While this software is a proven industry standard and is
in widespread use, it allows one person to make significant changes without oversight or approval. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls
will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if
there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the period ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

I, George Shen, certify that: 

1.    I
have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Earth Gen-Biofuel, Inc.;  

2.  
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;   

4.  
      I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a)  
      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b)  
      Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c)  
      Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

d)  
     
         Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s
        internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
        fourth fiscal quarter 
         in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
        or is reasonably likely to materially 
         affect, the registrant s internal control over financial
        reporting; and   

5.  
      I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)  
      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

b)  
      Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
