     Table of Contents          LOVE INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.    Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements   (Unaudited)      NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION, PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION      Love International Group, Inc. (formerly known as QUINTEC CORP.) ("we", "us", "our" or the "Company") was incorporated on May 23, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On November 11, 2015, a change in control of the Company occurred, whereby Walter Lee, the-then sole officer and director, sold 15,000,000 of his shares of common stock, representing 51.8% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, in a private transaction to Yong Qiang Yang (8,250,000 shares) and Wei Min Jin (6,750,000 shares), who subsequently became officers and directors of the Company. Mr. Lee sold the remainder of his shares (5,000,000 shares) to other individuals in separate transactions not involving a public sale or distribution. After the sale of stock, Walter Lee had no further ownership of any voting securities of the Company.     On November 30, 2015, the Company accepted the resignation of Walter Lee from his positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and member of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors appointed Yong Qiang Yang as President of the Company, and as a member of the Board of Directors, and Wei Min Jin as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors, effective November 30, 2015.     All references above to share and per share data have not been adjusted to give effect of the forward stock split (see below).     On February 4, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved: (a) changing the name of the Company to Love International Group, Inc. ("Name Change"); (b) increasing the aggregate number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company from one hundred and fifty million (150,000,000) shares, par value $0.001, to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares, par value $0.0001 per share ("Authorized Share Increase"); (c) a 10-for-1 forward stock split ("Forward Split"; together with the Name Change and Authorized Share Increase, the "Corporate Actions") of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company; and (d) a new trading symbol of LOVV.     On February 5, 2016, the Corporate Actions became effective and the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company became 289,333,360.     On March 7, 2016, the trading symbol changed to LOVV and a new CUSIP number (54714U107) was assigned to the Company's common stock.     On May 18, 2016, the Company shifted its business focus from developing and launching an online, cross-border e-commerce platform to promote and market worldwide premium specialties and other well-known branded products with highly comparable discount pricing to developing and launching an online platform to promote cheap airline tickets and hotels as well as developing and launching a "Do-It-Yourself" ("DIY") system for the Company's customers to put together a trip with exotic activities such as hunting, flying a plane, or even piloting a submarine.     The Company anticipates the prices of the airline tickets and hotel rooms promoted on its online platform will be priced competitively, if not lower, than the marketplace as the Company plans on partnering with some of the airlines and big airline ticket wholesalers. As for the DIY system, the Company anticipates gaining market share based on the originality and specialty of the travel activities to be offered on the Company's online platform through local travel companies and/or travel specialists that the Company is going to partner with.     In the beginning, the Company anticipates targeting potential customers in mainland China and Hong Kong as to the promotion of airline tickets and hotel rooms. The airline tickets and hotel booking selections may be limited upon the launch of the Company's online platform. The Company anticipates focusing the DIY activities upon the launch of the online platform in South East Asia, Canada, United States and Australia.                 7       
     Table of Contents         The Company does not yet have any operations and the development of its business is speculative. The Company will require additional financing, either through a stock offering, or standard or convertible debt. Until and unless it is able to secure adequate financing, its business development will be curtailed.     The Company had a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit from recurring net losses as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to raise additional funds through financing, either through a stock offering, or standard or convertible debt, in the future to meet its daily cash demands if required. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining further financing.     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.     We have not generated any operating revenues to date.     All common share and per share amounts disclosed herein and in the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the forward stock split, except as otherwise provided herein.      NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation           The condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").     The interim condensed financial information as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have not been included. The interim condensed financial information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company's Transition Report on Form 10-K for the eleven-month transition period ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016.     On January 20, 2016, the Company elected to change its fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31. As a result of this change, the Company's fiscal year 2015 was an 11-month transition period ending on December 31, 2015. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in the Company's Transition Report on Form 10-K on the eleven-month transition period ended December 31, 2015. As a result of this change, in these condensed financial statements, including the notes thereto, the Company reported its financial results for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 with corresponding results for the fiscal periods ended September 30, 2015.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include all significant normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company's interim condensed financial position as of September 30, 2016, its interim condensed results of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, and its interim condensed results of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.       Estimates and Assumptions       The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations.                 8       
     Table of Contents           Foreign Currency Transactions       The reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar ("U.S. Dollars"). The financial records of the Company are maintained in U.S. Dollars, which is the functional currency.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are translated into the functional currencies at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. Dollars at historical exchange rates. Transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars during the period are converted into U.S. Dollars at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing at the transaction dates. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statements of operations.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash consists of cash on hand and in banks. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments, with initial terms of less than three months to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents consisted of only cash.       Fair Value Measurements       ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Certain current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments. Management believes their carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and, if applicable, their current interest rates are equivalent to interest rates currently available. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:                      Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.                        Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.                        Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.         The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, balance with related parties and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments or the rate of interest of these instruments approximate the market rate of interest.       Property, Plant and Equipment       Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Depreciation is computed using the diminishing balance method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:             Equipment    3 years         The cost and accumulated depreciation of property, plant and equipment sold are removed from the balance sheets and resulting gains or losses are recognized in the statements of operations.                 9       
     Table of Contents           Long-Lived Assets       Long-lived assets which include property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.     Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.       Stock-Based Compensation       The Company adopted ASC 718, Compensation   Stock-Based Compensation, to account for its stock options and similar equity instruments issued. Accordingly, compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the expected vesting period. ASC 718 requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. We did not grant any stock options since inception on May 23, 2013 through September 30, 2016.       Income Taxes       Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period that includes the enactment date.     The impact of an uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes.       Basic and Diluted Loss per Share       Loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. We have adopted ASC 260, "Earnings per Share". Diluted loss per share for all the periods presented was the same as basic loss per share as there were no potential dilutive equity instruments.       New Accounting Pronouncements       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organization's management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements.     Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption.            NOTE 3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT      Property and equipment consisted of the following:           During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred depreciation expense of $0 and $375, respectively. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred depreciation expenses of $0 and $125, respectively.      NOTE 4. DUE TO RELATED PARTIES      Due to related parties consisted of the following:        _____________          (a)    As of September 30, 2015, the Company owed its ex-president and director $5,167 for incorporated fees he paid on its behalf.                  (b)    Yong Qiang Yang and Wei Min Jin, both directors of the Company, have beneficial interests in these companies.         The above balances are unsecured, non-interest bearing and have no specific terms for repayment.      NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY      On February 5, 2016, a 10-for-1 forward stock split became effective and the aggregate number of shares was adjusted to 1,000,000,000, par value $0.0001 per share.     During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not issue any common stock.     As at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had 289,333,360 shares issued and outstanding.      NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES      The Company is subject to a statutory tax rate of 34% under United States of America tax law. No provision for income taxes in the United States or elsewhere has been made as it had no taxable income since its inception.     The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal and state income statutory tax rates to pretax loss as follows:                Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components:           The Company has accumulated net operating loss carryovers of approximately $135,349 as of September 30, 2016 which are available to reduce future taxable income. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes may be subject to annual limitations. A change in ownership may limit the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards in future years. The tax losses begin to expire in 2034. The fiscal year 2015 remains open to examination by federal tax authorities and other tax jurisdictions.      NOTE 7.

Recent Developments       On November 11, 2015, a change in control of the Company occurred, whereby Walter Lee, the-then sole officer and director, sold 15,000,000 of his shares of common stock, representing 51.8% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, in a private transaction to Yong Qiang Yang (8,250,000 shares) and Wei Min Jin (6,750,000 shares), who subsequently became officers and directors of the Company. Mr. Lee sold the remainder of his shares (5,000,000 shares) to other individuals in separate transactions not involving a public sale or distribution. After the sale of stock, Walter Lee had no further ownership of any voting securities of the Company.     On November 30, 2015, the Company accepted the resignation of Walter Lee from his positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and member of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors appointed Yong Qiang Yang as President of the Company, and as a member of the Board of Directors, and Wei Min Jin as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors, effective November 30, 2015.     All references above to share and per share data have not been adjusted to give effect of the forward stock split (see below).     On February 4, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved: (a) changing the name of the Company to Love International Group, Inc. ("Name Change"); (b) increasing the aggregate number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company from one hundred and fifty million (150,000,000) shares, par value $0.001, to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares, par value $0.0001 per share ("Authorized Share Increase"); (c) a 10-for-1 forward stock split ("Forward Split"; together with the Name Change and Authorized Share Increase, the "Corporate Actions") of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company; and (d) a new trading symbol of LOVV.     On February 5, 2016, the Corporate Actions became effective and the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company became 289,333,360.     On March 7, 2016, the trading symbol changed to LOVV and a new CUSIP number (54714U107) was assigned to the Company's common stock.            Plan of Operation      On May 18, 2016, the Company shifted its business focus from developing and launching an online, cross-border e-commerce platform to promote and market worldwide premium specialties and other well-known branded products with highly comparable discount pricing to developing and launching an online platform to promote cheap airline tickets and hotels as well as developing and launching a DIY system for the Company's customers to put together a trip with exotic activities such as hunting, flying a plane, or even piloting a submarine.     The Company anticipates the prices of the airline tickets and hotel rooms promoted on its online platform will be priced competitively, if not lower, than the marketplace as the Company plans on partnering with some of the airlines and big airline ticket wholesalers. As for the DIY system, the Company anticipates gaining market share based on the originality and specialty of the travel activities to be offered on the Company's online platform through local travel companies and/or travel specialists that the Company is going to partner with.     In the beginning, the Company anticipates targeting potential customers in mainland China and Hong Kong as to the promotion of airline tickets and hotel rooms. The airline tickets and hotel booking selections may be limited upon the launch of the Company's online platform. The Company anticipates focusing the DIY activities upon the launch of the online platform in South East Asia, Canada, United States and Australia.     We do not yet have any operations and the development of our business is speculative. We will require additional financing, either through a stock offering, or standard or convertible debt. Until and unless we are able to secure adequate financing, our business development will be curtailed.      Results of Operation      The following table provides selected financial data about our company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.           The following summary of our results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, as included in this Form 10-Q.      Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015                   Revenue      For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no revenue.      Expenses      The majority of our expenses were primarily professional fees related to ongoing regulatory costs. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $5,140, decreasing by $525 from $5,665 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was mainly attributed to decreased professional fees.      Net loss      Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,140, decreasing by $525 from a net loss of $5,665 for the same period in 2015.      Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015             Revenue      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no revenue.      Expenses      The majority of our expenses were primarily professional fees related to ongoing regulatory costs. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $44,075 increasing by $17,056 from $27,019 for the same period in 2015. The increase was mainly attributed to increased professional fees.      Net loss      Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $44,075, increasing by $17,056, from a net loss of $27,019 for the same period in 2015.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      To date we are still preparing to launch our principal plan of operations. Thus we have minimal business and our expenses have been primarily for professional fees related to past registration statements and ongoing regulatory expenses.     We anticipate we will need $100,000 to fund the next 12 months of our operations. Currently we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations and business development for the next 12 months.           Management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us.     As at September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $0 and we had current liabilities $85,635.     We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2016.     We have no known demands or commitments, and we are not aware of any events or uncertainties as of September 30, 2016 that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.      Working Capital             Cash Flows            As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our cash balance was $0 and $150 respectively and our total current assets were $12,602 as of September 30, 2016 compared with cash of $150 as of December 31, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses.     As of September 30, 2016, our company had total liabilities of $85,635 compared with total liabilities of $29,108 as of December 31, 2015.     As of September 30, 2016, our company had a working capital deficiency of $73,033 compared with $28,958 as of December 31, 2015. The increase in the working capital deficiency was primarily due to the costs associated with ongoing regulatory requirements.      Cash Flow from Operating Activities      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our company used $65,556 and $24,829 in cash from operating activities, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 our professional fees related to ongoing regulatory requirements were paid by related parties on our behalf.      Cash Flow from Investing Activities      We did not use any funds for investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Cash Flow from Financing Activities      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $65,406 from advances from related parties compared to $8,900 from advances from related parties and cash from common shares issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.            Going Concern      We had a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit from recurring net losses as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to raise additional funds through financing, either through a stock offering, or standard or convertible debt, in the future to meet our daily cash demands if required. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining further financing.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.      Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital      There is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have generated no revenues from operations since our inception. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in developing our website, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.     At present, we do not have enough cash on hand to cover operating costs for the next 12 months.     If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our condensed financial statements.     While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.     Our significant accounting policies are described more fully in Note 2 to our accompanying condensed financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this Management Discussion and Analysis.      Foreign Currency Transactions      The reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar ("U.S. Dollars"). The financial records of the Company are maintained in U.S. Dollars, which is the functional currency.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are translated into the functional currencies at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. Dollars at historical exchange rates. Transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars during the period are converted into U.S. Dollars at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing at the transaction dates. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statements of operations.             Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.     The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (4) management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls; (5) lack of appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements; and (6) insufficient skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our President and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.     In order to cure the foregoing material weakness, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures:                     We intend to establish an audit committee of the board of directors as soon as practicable. We envision that the audit committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors, evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls.                         We are committed to establishing the internal audit functions but due to limited qualified personnel in the region, we were not able to hire sufficient internal audit resources by September 30, 2016.                    We plan to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on US GAAP, SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements.         Despite the material weakness and deficiencies reported above, our management believes that our financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2016, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.             PART II. OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.       We did not issue unregistered equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.       None.       Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.       Not applicable.       Item 5. Other Information.        Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant      On September 26, 2016, the Company was advised that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Crowe Horwath (HK) CPA Limited ( CHHK ), will no longer provide audit and assurances services to public companies subject to the statutes and regulations of the United States effective as of October 1, 2016. Accordingly, the Company, with the approval of its board of directors, terminated the services of CHHK effective September 30, 2016, and retained the services of Centurion ZD CPA Limited (formerly DCAW (CPA) Limited) effective September 30, 2016 as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm.
