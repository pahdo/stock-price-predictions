1.  Presentation of Interim Financial Statements  

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation         BBX Capital Corporation together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as  BBX Capital ,  we ,  us,  or  our  and is referred to herein without its subsidiaries as  BBX Capital Corporation . BBX Capital is a Florida-based company involved in the acquisition, development, ownership and management of and investments in real estate and real estate development projects as well as operating businesses.  Prior to the sale of BankAtlantic to BB T Corporation ( BB T ) on July 31, 2012, BBX Capital   Corporation   was a bank holding company and its principal asset was the ownership of BankAtlantic.    The principal assets of BBX Capital currently consist of its 46% equity interest in Woodbridge Holdings, LLC ( Woodbridge ), investments in real estate joint ventures   and operating businesses  ,    and   legacy loans and real estate assets transferred to BBX Capital in connection with the sale of BankAtlantic  .   

In April 2013, BBX Capital acquired a   46%   equity interest in Woodbridge. Woodbridge s principal asset is its ownership of Bluegreen Corporation and its subsidiaries ( Bluegreen ). Bluegreen manages, markets and sells the Bluegreen Vacation Club, a points-based, deeded vacation ownership plan with more than   190,000   owners.  BFC Financial Corporation ( BFC ), the controlling shareholder of BBX Capital, owns the remaining   54%   of Woodbridge (see Note 2 - Investment in Woodbridge Holdings, LLC).   

In October 2013, Renin Holdings, LLC ( Renin ), a joint venture owned   81%   by BBX Capital and   19%   by BFC, acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Renin Corp. ( the Renin Transaction ).  Renin manufactures interior closet doors, wall d cor, hardware and fabricated glass products. Renin is headquartered in Canada and has   two   manufacturing, assembly and distribution facilities in Canada and the United States. 

In December 2013, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBX Capital, BBX Sweet Holdings, LLC, acquired Hoffman s Chocolates ( Hoffman s ).  Hoffman s is a manufacturer of gourmet chocolates, with retail locations in South Florida.    

Subsequent to January 2014, BBX Sweet Holdings acquired manufacturers in the chocolate and candy industries serving wholesalers, boutique retailers, big box chains, department stores, national resort properties, corporate customers and private label brands.  The companies acquired were Williams and Bennett, Helen Grace Chocolates ( Helen Grace ), Jer s Chocolates ( Jer s ), Anastasia Confections ( Anastasia ) and Kencraft Confections, LLC ( Kencraft ).    In May 2015, BBX Sweet Holdings acquired a controlling interest in Droga Chocolates, LLC.

In September 2016, BBX Capital entered into an area development agreement with MOD Super Fast Pizza, LLC with a goal of opening   50   MOD Super Fast Pizza franchise locations throughout Florida over the next   seven   years.    

BBX Capital has   two   classes of common stock. Holders of the Class A common stock are entitled to   one   vote per share, which in the aggregate represents   53%   of the combined voting power of the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock. Class B common stock represents the remaining   47%   of the combined vote. The percentage of total common equity represented by Class A and Class B common stock was   99%   and   1%  , respectively, at   September   30, 2016.  The fixed voting percentages will be eliminated, and shares of Class B common stock will be entitled to only   one   vote per share from and after the date that BFC or its affiliates no longer own in the aggregate at least   97,523   shares of Class B common stock (which is   one  -half of the number of shares it now owns). Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock on a share for share basis at any time at BFC s discretion.  

On September 30, 2016,   381,622   shares of restricted Class A common stock units granted to executive officers in September 2012 and September 2014 vested.  BBX Capital repurchased and retired an aggregate of   158,024   shares of the executive officers  Class A common stock to satisfy the   $3.2   million withholding tax obligations associated with the vesting of these shares. Between October 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016   104,872   shares of restricted Class A common stock units granted to executive officers in September 2015 vested.  BBX Capital repurchased and retired an aggregate of   43,749   shares of the executive officers  Class A common stock to satisfy the   $0.9   million withholding tax obligations associated with the vesting of these shares. 

BBX Capital entered into a definitive merger agreement (the  Merger Agreement ) with BFC and BBX Merger Subsidiary LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of BFC ( Merger Sub )   on July 27, 2016 and amended on October 20, 2016  . The Merger Agreement provides for BBX Capital Corporation to merge with and into Merger Sub (the  Merger ), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of BFC. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by a special committee comprised of BBX Capital Corporation s independent directors as well as the full boards of directors of both BFC and BBX Capital Corporation, each share of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock held by BFC and shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock as

to which appraisal rights are exercised and perfected in accordance with Florida law) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder  ,     5.4   shares of BFC s Class A Common Stock or   $20.00   in cash for each share of BBX Class A Common Stock held by them.  BBX Capital s shareholders will have the right to elect to receive all cash, all stock, or a combination of cash and stock in exchange for their shares. Each option to acquire shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock that is outstanding at the effective time of the Merger, whether or not then exercisable, will be converted into an option to acquire shares of BFC s Class A Common Stock and be subject to the same terms and conditions as in effect at the effective time of the Merger, except that the number of shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the option will be multiplied by the exchange ratio of   5.4   shares of BFC s Class A Common Stock for each share of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock subject to the option and the exercise price of the option will be divided by 5.4. In addition, each share of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock subject to a restricted stock award outstanding at the effective time of the Merger will be converted into a restricted share of BFC s Class A Common Stock and be subject to the same terms and conditions as in effect at the effective time of the Merger, except that the number of shares subject to the award will be multiplied by the exchange ratio of 5.4 shares of BFC s Class A Common Stock for each share of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock subject to the award.  Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, without limitation,   (i)   the approval of the Merger Agreement by   (a)   holders of shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the Merger Agreement,   and    (  b  ) holders of a majority of the shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock voted on the Merger Agreement other than shares held by BFC and its affiliates   and (ii) unless waived by BFC and BBX Capital,   any litigation or threatened litigation against   BFC or BBX Capital Corporation   or their affiliates relating to the   Me  rger shall be resolved to the satisfaction of BFC and BBX Capital   Corporation   or the holders of at least   2,250,000   shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock shall execute   a     w  aiver and   r  elease irrevocably waiving the right to participate in, or receive any proceeds from, any shareholder class action lawsuit relating to the   M  erger   and releasing BFC, BBX Capital and their affiliates from any claims arising out of the Merger Agreement other than with respect to appraisal rights or the right to receive the Merger consideration  .   Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BFC has agreed to vote all of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock owned by it in favor of the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, approval of the Merger Agreement with respect to the combine  d   vote of the holders of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock described under clause (i)  (a)   above is assured. There is no assurance that the approval of the unaffiliated shareholders will be received. The Merger is also conditioned  , unless waived,   on holders of not more than   150,000   shares of BBX Capital s Class A Common Stock exercising appraisal rights and the absence of any  Material Adverse Effect  (as defined in the Merger Agreement)      with respect to either BFC or BBX Capital. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. There is no assurance that   the conditions to completing the Merger will be satisfied or waived, or that   the   M  erger will be   otherwise   consummated in the anticipated time frame, on the proposed terms,   or at all. 

A lawsuit seeking to establish a class of BBX Capital s shareholders and challenging the Merger is pending in the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the proposed Merger consideration undervalues BBX Capital and is unfair to BBX Capital s public shareholders and that BBX Capital s directors and BFC breached certain fiduciary duties to BBX Capital s public shareholders. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the Merger or, if it is completed, to rescind the Merger or recover relief as determined by the court. BFC and BBX Capital believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action. See Note 10 and  Part II, Item 1   Legal Proceedings  of this report for additional information regarding this lawsuit.  BFC and BBX Capital have also received letters threatening additional litigation relating to the Merger. 

All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  As used in each case in this document, the term  fair value  is an estimate of fair value as discussed herein. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of BBX Capital have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information.   Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements.     In management's opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) as are necessary for a fair statement of BBX Capital's condensed consolidated statement of financial condition at   September   30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, and the condensed consolidated statements of total equity and statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results of operations that may be expected for the subsequent interim period during 2016 or for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to BBX Capital by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential

dilution that could occur if options to issue common shares were exercised or restricted stock units of BBX Capital were to vest. In calculating diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to BBX Capital is divided by the weighted average number of common shares. Options and restricted stock units are included in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding based on the treasury stock method, if dilutive.  During the three and   nine   months ended   September    3  0  , 2016, options to acquire   6,614   shares of Class A common stock were anti-dilutive   and excluded from diluted earnings per share  .  During the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015, options to acquire   10,323   shares of Class A common stock were anti-dilutive   and excluded from diluted earnings per share  . 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

As of January 1, 2016, BBX Capital adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) Number   2015-03    Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs as amended by ASU 2015-15.    ASU 2015-03 requ  ires debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liabilities to be presented in the statement of financial condition as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than an asset. However, ASU 2015-03 also permits presentation of debt issuance costs on line-of-credit arrangements as assets. Accordingly, as of   September   30, 2016, approximately   $23,000   of deferred debt issuance costs was presented as a direct deduction within Notes Payable on BBX Capital's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Additionally, BBX Capital reclassified   $36,000   of deferred debt issuance costs from Other Assets to Notes Payable as of December 31, 2015. Debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements of   $257,000   and     $306,000   were included in other assets in BBX Capital s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

As of January 1, 2016, BBX Capital adopted ASU 2015-02     Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810)  .   ASU 2015-02 changed the manner in which a reporting entity assesses one of the five characteristics that determines if an entity is a variable interest entity.  In particular, when decision-making over the entity s most significant activities has been outsourced, the update changes how a reporting entity assesses if the equity holders at risk lack decision making rights. The update also introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making rights.    The adoption of this update on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on BBX Capital s consolidated financial statements  . 

New Accounting Pronouncements:  

The FASB has recently issued the following accounting pronouncements and guidance     relevant to   the preparation of   BBX Capital s   financial statements  . (See BBX Capital s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for accounting pronouncements issued prior to March 31, 2016 relevant to BBX Capital s operations):  

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This ASU presents guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in current practice. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.    BBX Capital   is currently evaluating the requirements of this update and has not yet determined its impact on   BBX Capital s   consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements.   The ASU changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded.    The ASU sets forth a  current expected credit loss  (CECL) model which requires   BBX Capital   to measure expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years   BBX Capital   is currently evaluating the requirements of this update and has not yet determined   the   impact   it may have   on   its   consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Update   (ASU) No.   2016-09   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    This update simplifies various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within the reporting period.  Early adoption is   permitted   in any interim or annual period.    The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on BBX Capital s   consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update   (ASU) No.      2016-07    Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.   This update eliminates retroactive adjustments for an investment that qualifies for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest associated with an existing investment.  The amendment requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest to the current investment and adopt the equity method on the date that the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.    The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on BBX Capital s   consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Update   (ASU) No.   2014-09        Revenue Recognition (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This guidance is intended to improve the financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with customers by providing a principle based approach. It also requires disclosures designed to enable readers of financial statements to   better   understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Further, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   in April   and May   2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10   and 2016-12, respectively,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)     and   also in May 2016     the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue   Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-19  . These updates clarify implementation guidance on the related topic. The accounting guidance updates will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The standard   is   effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 201  7  .  Earlier   adoption   is permitted only   for   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  BBX Capital is currently evaluating the requirements of these updates and has not yet determined   their   impact on   its   consolidated financial statements.  

2  .        Investment in Woodbridge Holdings, LLC 

On April 2, 2013,   BBX Capital   invested   $71.75   million in Woodbridge in exchange for a   46%   equity interest in Woodbridge. The investment was made in connection with Woodbridge s acquisition on April 2, 2013 of the publicly held shares of Bluegreen. BFC holds the remaining   54%   of Woodbridge s outstanding equity interests   and is the majority member of   Woodbridge.

Loans Measured For Impairment  

Impaired loans are generally valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell as the majority of BBX Capital s loans are collateral dependent. The fair value of BBX Capital s loans may significantly increase or decrease based on changes in property values.  BBX Capital primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring non-homogenous impaired loans and broker price opinions to assist in measuring homogenous impaired loans. The appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market observable data to formulate an estimate of the fair value of the loan s collateral. However, the appraiser uses professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral, and BBX Capital may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the appraisal date. When current appraisals are not available for certain loans, BBX Capital uses its judgment on market conditions to adjust the most current appraisal. As a consequence, the calculation of the fair value of the collateral is considered a Level 3 input. BBX Capital generally recognizes impairment losses based on third party broker price opinions when impaired homogenous loans become   120   days delinquent. These third party valuations from real estate professionals  

25   

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   UNAUDITED 

also use Level 3 inputs in determining fair values. The observable market inputs used to fair value loans include comparable property sales, rent rolls, market capitalization rates on income producing properties, risk adjusted discount rates and foreclosure time frames and exposure periods.   

Real Estate Held-for-Sale and Held-for-Investment 

Real estate is generally valued using third party appraisals or broker price opinions. These appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation techniques and use market observable data to formulate an estimate of the fair value of the properties. The market observable data typically consists of comparable property sales, rent rolls, market capitalization rates on income producing properties and risk adjusted discount rates.   The above inputs are considered Level 3 inputs as the appraiser uses professional judgment in the calculation of the fair value of the properties.

instruments using the income approach technique with Level 3 unobservable inputs. Management estimates used in net present value financial models rely on assumptions and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown and actual results or values may differ significantly from these estimates. BBX Capital s fair value estimates do not consider the tax effect that would be associated with the disposition of the assets or liabilities at their fair value estimates.  As such, BBX Capital may not receive the estimated value upon sale or disposition of the asset or pay the estimated value upon disposition of the liability in advance of its scheduled maturity. 

Fair values are estimated for loan portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by category, and each loan category is further segmented by delinquency categories. 

The fair value of loans is calculated by using an income approach with Level 3 inputs.  The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting forecasted cash flows using estimated market discount rates that reflect the interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio. Management assigns a credit risk premium and an illiquidity adjustment to these loans based on delinquency status.  The fair value of collateral dependent loans is estimated using an income approach with Level 3 inputs utilizing the fair value of the collateral adjusted for operating and selling expenses and discounted over the estimated holding period based on the market risk inherent in the property.    

The fair value of notes payables and principal and interest advances on residential loans were measured using the income approach with Level 3 inputs obtained by discounting the forecasted cash flows based on estimated market rates.  

10.  Commitments and Contingencies 

BBX Capital guarantees certain obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as described below: 

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Sunrise and Bayview Partners, LLC joint venture owned   50%   by Procacci Bayview, LLC and   50%   by BBX Capital refinanced its land acquisition loan with a financial institution.  BBX Capital provided the financial institution with a guarantee of   50%   of the outstanding balance of the joint venture s loan which had an outstanding balance of   $5.0   million as of September 30, 2016. 

In July 2014, BBX Capital entered into the Hialeah Communities joint venture with CC Bonterra to develop approximately   394   homes in a portion of the newly proposed Bonterra community in Hialeah, Florida. BBX Capital transferred approximately   50   acres of land at an agreed upon value of approximately   $15.6   million subject to an   $8.3   million mortgage which was assumed by the joint venture.  In March 2015, the joint venture refinanced the $8.3 million mortgage loan as part of a   $31.0   million acquisition and development loan.  In March 2016, the loan was modified reducing the loan balance from $31.0 million to   $26.5   million. BBX Capital is a guarantor of up to   $5.  3   million of the joint venture s $26.5 million acquisition and development loan. 

BBX Capital is a guarantor on a   $5.5   million note payable of Anastasia owed to the seller. The Anastasia note payable is also secured by the common stock of Anastasia.  In October 2016, BBX Capital made a   $2.0   million scheduled principal payment   and the outstanding principal balance of the   note payable to Anastasia   was reduced to $3.5 million  . 

On August 7, 2015, BBX Sweet Holdings entered into a Loan and Security Agreement and related agreements with Iberiabank, which provides for borrowings of up to   $5.0   million on a revolving basis. The outstanding availability of the Iberiabank facility was   $5.0   million as of September 30, 2016.        I  n February 2016, BBX Sweet Holdings executed Addendum No. 1 to the Iberiabank   Loan and Security Agreement  . The addendum replaced the debt service coverage financial covenant with a working capital to debt ratio financial covenant.   The facility is secured by the assets of BBX Sweet Holdings and its subsidiaries and is guaranteed by BBX Capital. BBX Sweet Holdings was in compliance with the debt financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

BBX Sweet Holdings and BBX Capital are guarantors of a   $1.6   million note payable of Hoffman s owed to Centennial Bank.  This note is secured by   $2.1   million of properties and equipment. 

In connection with the Kencraft acquisition, BBX Sweet Holdings issued a   $400,000   note payable maturing on   April 1, 2017   to the seller.  BBX Capital is the guarantor on this note payable. 

BBX Capital and its consolidated subsidiaries are parties to lawsuits as plaintiff or defendant involving its collections, lending and prior period tax certificate activities. Although BBX Capital believes it has meritorious defenses in all current legal actions, the outcome of litigation and the ultimate resolution are uncertain and inherently difficult to predict.

Reserves are accrued for matters in which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for these claims.  There were   no   reserves accrued as of September 30, 2016. 

In certain matters, BBX Capital is unable to estimate the loss or reasonable range of loss until additional developments in the case provide information sufficient to support an assessment of the loss or range of loss. Frequently in these matters the claims are broad and the plaintiffs have not quantified or factually supported the claim.      

BBX Capital believes that liabilities arising from litigation discussed below, in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, are not expected to have a material impact on BBX Capital s financial statements. However, due to the significant uncertainties involved in these legal matters, BBX Capital may incur losses in excess of accrued amounts and an adverse outcome in these matters could be material to the BBX Capital s consolidated financial statements.   

The discussion below does not include litigation relating to companies which are not consolidated into BBX Capital s financial statements, including Woodbridge and Bluegreen.   

The following is a description of certain ongoing or recently concluded litigation matters:   

Securities and Exchange Commission Complaint    

In early 2012, the SEC brought suit against BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan, BBX Capital s then-serving Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, alleging disclosure and accounting violations arising from public disclosures published in, or for the fiscal year ended, December 31, 2007. The case is styled   In re: Securities and Exchange Commission v. BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and Alan B. Levan.   Prior to trial, the district court entered two summary judgments, one finding as a matter of fact that three sentences in an earnings conference call on July 25, 2007 were false, and the other striking a reliance on accountants defense. On December 15, 2014, the jury rendered a verdict finding in favor of BBX Capital and Mr. Alan Levan on all of the claims but the two tied to the pretrial summary judgments. Following the trial, the district court entered a final judgment (i) barring Mr. Alan Levan from serving as an officer or director of any SEC reporting company for two years commencing on December 23, 2015, (ii) imposing monetary penalties of   $4,550,000   against BBX Capital and   $1,300,000   against Mr. Alan Levan; and (iii) permanently restraining BBX Capital and Mr. Alan Levan from violating securities laws. As a result of the court s decision, effective December 23, 2015, Mr. Alan Levan resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital, as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BFC, and as a director of BBX Capital and BFC. BBX Capital and Mr. Alan Levan appealed the district court s judgment to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On September 28, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the pretrial summary judgments and set aside the judgment of the district court. The reversal,   once   final, will terminate the financial penalties and set aside the two year officer and director bar imposed against Mr. Alan Levan. The court remanded the case for a new trial on the two claims stripped of the summary judgments  .     The   SEC   has   the right to seek a retrial of the two claims. The order entered by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals will not be final until the time to file motions for rehearing expire or any filed motions for rehearing are denied.   Once   the decision is final, it is expected that Mr. Alan Levan will be re-appointed as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BFC and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital. Mr. Alan Levan continues to serve BFC and BBX Capital in a non-executive capacity as Founder and strategic advisor to each company s board of directors.  

New Jersey Tax Sales Certificates Antitrust Litigation 

On December 21, 2012, plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in an existing purported class action filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey adding BBX Capital and Fidelity Tax, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CAM, among others as defendants.  The class action complaint is brought on behalf of a class defined as  all persons who owned real property in the State of New Jersey and who had a Tax Certificate issued with respect to their property that was purchased by a Defendant during the Class Period at a public auction in the State of New Jersey at an interest rate above   0%  .   Plaintiffs alleged that beginning in January 1998 and at least through February 2009, the Defendants were part of a statewide conspiracy to manipulate interest rates associated with tax certificates sold at public auction from at least January 1, 1998, through February 28, 2009. During this period, Fidelity Tax was a subsidiary of BankAtlantic.  Fidelity Tax was contributed to CAM in connection with the sale of BankAtlantic in the BB T Transaction. BBX Capital and Fidelity Tax filed a Motion to Dismiss in March 2013 and on October 23, 2013, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss and dismissed the Amended Complaint with prejudice as to certain claims, but without prejudice as to plaintiffs  main antitrust claim.  BBX Capital reached an agreement to settle the action   for   $400,000     and the court approved the settlement in September 2016.

Litigation Regarding Proposed Merger 

On August 10, 2016, Shiva Stein filed a lawsuit against BFC, Merger Sub, BBX Capital and the members of BBX Capital s board of directors, which seeks to establish a class of BBX Capital s shareholders and challenges the currently proposed Merger   pursuant to which BBX Capital would   merge with and into   a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC  .  This action, styled   Shiva Stein, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, v. BBX Capital Corp., John E. Abdo, Norman H. Becker, Steven M. Coldren, Willis N. Holcombe, Jarett S. Levan, Anthony P. Segreto, Charlie C. Winningham, II, BFC Financial Corporation and BBX Merger Subsidiary LLC, Case No. CACE16014713  , was filed in the Circuit Court of the 17   th   Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. The plaintiff asserts that the proposed Merger consideration undervalues BBX Capital and is unfair to BBX Capital s public shareholders, that the sales process was unfair and that BBX Capital s directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and candor owed to the public shareholders of BBX Capital because, among other reasons, they failed to take steps to maximize the value of BBX Capital to its public shareholders and instead diverted consideration to themselves. The lawsuit also alleges that BFC, as the controlling shareholder of BBX Capital, breached its fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and candor owed to the public shareholders of BBX Capital by utilizing confidential, non-public information to formulate the Merger consideration and not acting in the best interests of BBX Capital s public shareholders. In addition, the lawsuit includes a cause of action against BBX Capital, BFC and Merger Sub for aiding and abetting the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.   The lawsuit requests that the court grant an injunction blocking the proposed Merger or, if the proposed Merger is completed, rescind the transaction or award damages as determined by the court.  BFC and BBX Capital believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action. 

A second lawsuit which sought to challenge the merger and included many of the same claims as set forth in the   Stein   action described above was filed in the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida during September 2016. This lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice during October 2016. 

BBX Capital and BFC have also received threats of additional litigation relating to the proposed Merger. 

11  .    Subsequent Event 

BBX Capital obtained entitlements to develop raw land in St Johns County, Florida into   1,476   finished lots which will comprise the Beacon Lake Community.  BBX Capital acquired the undeveloped property through foreclosure and intends to sell the finished lots to home builders. The Meadow View at Twin Creeks Community Development District ( CDD ) was formed by St. Johns County in connection with the issuance of community development bonds to fund infrastructure improvements in the Beacon Lake Community.  In November 2016, the CDD issued   $21.4   million of bonds.  The CDD bonds are secured by a lien on the property and are repaid through special assessments on the property. The CDD bonds are nonrecourse to BBX Capital.  The carrying value of the property was   $9.7   million as of September 30, 2016.

Item   2  .      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The objective of the following discussion is to provide an understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of BBX Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. All opinions, forecasts, projections, future plans or other statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include words or phrases such as  plans,   believes,   will,   expects,   anticipates,   intends,   estimates,   our view,   we see,   would  and words and phrases of similar import. The forward looking statements in this document are also forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  Forward-looking statements are based largely on management s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on factors which are, in many instances, beyond our control. There is no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Future results could differ materially as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties.  

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:  

the impact of economic, competitive and other factors affecting BBX Capital and its assets, including the impact of decreases in real estate values on BBX Capital s business, the value of BBX Capital s assets, the ability of BBX Capital s borrowers to service their obligations and the value of collateral securing BBX Capital s loans;      

the risk of loan losses and the risks of additional charge-offs, impairments and required increases in BBX Capital s allowance for loan losses and trade receivables;      

the risk of loss of significant customers or key personnel in our operating companies;      

the risk of losses associated with excess and obsolete inventory and the risks of additional required reserves for lower of cost or market value losses in inventory;       

the risk that the SEC may seek a rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that set aside the judgment and penalties imposed by the district court in connection with the action brought by the SEC against BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan, BBX Capital s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;     

the risk that the SEC prevails in a rehearing or a new trial and BBX Capital s insurance carrier seeks to obtain reimbursement of the amounts it previously advanced to BBX Capital in connection with the action brought by the SEC against BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan;      

adverse conditions in the stock market, the public debt market and other financial and credit markets and the impact of such conditions on BBX Capital s activities;      

the   risk that the assets retained by BBX Capital as part of the sale of BankAtlantic to BB T may not be monetized at the values currently ascribed to them   and the risks associated with the impact of periodic valuation of BBX Capital s assets for impairment.           

In addition, this document contains forward looking statements relating to BBX Capital s ability to successfully implement its currently anticipated business plans, which may not be realized as anticipated, if at all, and BBX Capital s current and anticipated investments in operating businesses and franchises may not achieve the returns anticipated or may not be profitable, including the risks associated with the operations and activities of:  

BBX Capital s investment in Bluegreen (through Woodbridge),      

BBX Sweet Holdings  acquisitions of Hoffman s, Williams   Bennett, Jer s Chocolates, Droga Chocolates, Helen Grace Chocolates, Anastasia Confections and Kencraft,      

BBX Capital s anticipated investments in MOD Super Fast Pizza franchise locations, and      

BBX Capital s acquisition with BFC of Renin.      

This document also contains forward looking statements relating to BBX Capital s investments in real estate developments, either directly or through joint ventures.  These risks include:  

exposure to downturns in the real estate and housing markets;      

exposure to risks associated with real estate development activities;      

risks associated with obtaining necessary zoning and entitlements;      

risks that BBX Capital s joint venture partners may not fulfill their obligations and concentration risks associated with entering into numerous joint ventures with one joint venture partner;     

risk of reliance on third party developers or joint venture partners to complete real estate projects, and      

risks that the projects will not be developed as anticipated or be profitable.       

30   

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

BBX Capital s investment in Woodbridge, which owns Bluegreen Corporation, exposes BBX Capital to:  

risks relating to Bluegreen s business and Bluegreen s ability to pay dividends to Woodbridge and in turn Woodbridge s ability to pay dividends to BBX Capital, and     

risks inherent in the vacation ownership industry, including risks associated with regulatory compliance and customer complaints and other risks which are identified in BFC s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2016 with the SEC and available on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.       

BBX Sweet Holdings   acquisitions and BBX Capital s acquisition of the assets of Renin Corp exposes BBX Capital to the risks of their respective businesses, which include:  

the amount and terms of indebtedness associated with the acquisitions and operations which may impact BBX Capital s financial condition and results of operations and limit BBX Capital s activities;      

the failure of the companies to meet financial covenants and that BBX Capital may be required to make further capital contributions or advances to the acquired companies;      

the risk of commodity price volatility;     

the risk that the integration of these operating businesses may not be completed effectively or on a timely basis;      

the risk that BBX Capital may not realize any anticipated benefits or profits from these acquisitions; and      

Renin s operations expose BBX Capital to foreign currency exchange risk of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar and Great Britain pound.        

Past performance and perceived trends may not be indicative of future results.    In addition to the risks and factors identified above, reference is also made to other risks and factors detailed in BBX Capital s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2015.  BBX Capital cautions that the foregoing factors are not exclusive.   

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of BBX Capital s financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral dependent loans, the valuation of loans held-for-sale, the impairment of long-lived assets including amortizable intangible assets,     real estate held-for-sale and   real estate   held-for-investment, the determination of lower of cost or market for inventories, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business, the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax positions and accounting for contingencies. The three accounting policies that BBX Capital has identified as critical accounting policies are allowance for loan losses, inventory reserves and impairment of long-lived assets  .   For a more detailed discussion of these critical accounting policies see  Critical Accounting Policies  appearing in BBX Capital s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

BBX Capital s Business Strategy 

Since the sale of BankAtlantic in July 2012, BBX Capital has been repositioning its business, monetizing its legacy portfolios of loans and real estate, and pursuing its goal of transitioning into a growth business by focusing on real estate opportunities and acquiring operating businesses.   

The majority of BBX Capital s assets do not generate income on a regular or predictable basis. Recognizing the nature of BBX Capital s assets, BBX Capital s goal is to build long-term value as opposed to focusing on quarterly or annual earnings.  While capital markets generally encourage short term results, BBX Capital s objective continues to be long term growth as measured by increases in book value per share over time. Further, BBX Capital does not expect to generate significant revenue from the legacy BankAtlantic assets until the assets are monetized through repayments or transactions involving the sale, joint venture or development of the underlying real estate. BBX Capital is currently utilizing the cash flow from the monetization of its assets and dividends from Woodbridge to pay operating expenses and to invest in income producing real estate, real estate developments, real estate joint ventures and operating businesses.     While there is no assurance it will be successful, BBX Capital is seeking to manage its cash needs and the timing of monetizing its existing assets with new investments to maximize its returns. In some cases, this may involve immediate sale and in other cases a longer term hold or development (either directly or through a joint venture).  BBX Capital may also consider transactions  

31   

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

involving its investments in operating businesses, including Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings, and BBX Capital may in connection with BBX Capital s investment with BFC in Woodbridge pursue transactions involving Bluegreen, either directly or indirectly through a transaction involving Woodbridge, to monetize all or a portion of BBX Capital s investment in Woodbridge. Such transactions may include pursuing a future sale or spin-off of a company or other transactions involving public or private issuances of a company s debt or equity securities which might result in the ownership of less than 100% of an entity.  BBX Capital is also engaged in land entitlement activities and land development projects on certain properties that BBX Capital acquired through foreclosure. These projects have included or may include in the future selling or leasing the improved properties to third parties or entering into joint ventures with developers for the development of residential and commercial real estate projects involving the contribution of properties by BBX Capital as well as potential cash investments in projects.  BBX Capital has also pursued potential investments in joint venture real estate projects that include real estate held by a joint venture partner or property acquired from unrelated parties.  As a result of the substantial decline in real estate values during the recession, the majority of BBX Capital s non-performing commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate were written down in prior periods to the then prevailing estimated fair values of the collateral less costs to sell.  BBX Capital has seen significant improvements generally in real estate markets and believes that the prior estimated fair values of the underlying collateral securing certain of BBX Capital s commercial real estate loans and BBX Capital s real estate carrying values may be below current market values.  Additionally, the recovery in the real estate market has favorably affected the financial condition of BBX Capital s borrowers and BBX Capital is aggressively pursuing its borrowers and/or guarantors in order to maximize recoveries through cash settlements, loan workout arrangements or participation interests in the development or performance of the collateral.  If BBX Capital is successful in its efforts, BBX Capital expects to recognize gains to the extent that the amounts it collects exceed the carrying value of its commercial loans and foreclosed real estate and expects that these gains will be reflected in an increase in BBX Capital s shareholders  equity in the long term.  Due to the nature of these activities however, BBX Capital does not expect to generate revenues or earnings on a predictable or consistent basis and BBX Capital may continue to experience current losses from these investments with an anticipated goal of building long term value.  Accordingly, BBX Capital expects the results of its operations to vary significantly on a quarterly basis and BBX Capital may experience losses in future periods.    

Consolidated Results of Operations  

BBX Capital     conducts   its operations   through three   reportable segments, BBX  ,     Renin and Sweet Holdings  .   

BBX Reportable Segment    -     The BBX reportable segment consists of the activities associated with managing its commercial loan portfolio, real estate properties and portfolio of charged off loans retained as part of the sale of BankAtlantic to BB T and managing its investments in Woodbridge and in real estate joint ventures.   

Renin Reportable Segment     -     The Renin reportable segment consists of the activities of Renin Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Renin ).

Renin is headquartered in Brampton, Ontario and has   two   manufacturing, assembly and distribution facilities located in Brampton, Ontario   and   Tupelo, Mississippi  .  BBX Capital owns 81% of Renin and BFC owns the remaining 19%. 

Sweet Holdings Reportable Segment     -   The Sweet Holdings reportable segment consists of the activities of acquired operating businesses in the candy and confection industry including the activities of Hoffman s, Jer s, Williams   Bennett, Helen Grace, Anastasia, Kencraft and Droga.

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

I  ncome   before provision (benefit) for income taxes for   each of   BBX Capital   s reportable segments was as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 

Represents capitalized interest on real estate development and joint venture activities in excess of interest expense incurred in the BBX reportable segment.       

(2) 

Benefit for income taxes for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015 resulted from acquisition related measurement adjustments.     

BBX     Reportable Segment Results of Operations 

The following table is a condensed income statement summarizing the results of operations of the BBX reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Total Revenues 

The decrease in interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 periods resulted primarily from   $1.1   million and $2.2 million, respectively, of interest income received from non-

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

accrual commercial loans during the 2015 periods and lower consumer, residential and small business loan interest income recognized during the 2016 periods associated with the amortization of loan balances in the portfolios.     

Gains on sales of assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from a $3.5 million gain on the sale of two commercial land parcels and the recognition of a $1.6 million deferred gain associated with property contributed to a joint venture during the second quarter of 2014. The remaining gains on the sales of assets resulted primarily from sales of residential foreclosed properties. 

The losses on the sales of assets during the three months ended September 30, 2015   were associated with   the sale  s   of residential properties.   

The decrease in gains on the sales of assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted primarily from gains associated with the sales of two properties located in West Palm Beach, Florida during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. One of the properties, which was purchased by JRG/BBX Development joint venture for $10.8 million, was sold to a third party developer for $20.0 million. The other property, which was acquired by BBX through foreclosure and had a $3.2 million carrying value at the date of sale, sold for $11.0 million.  BBX recognized a gain of $15.5 million in connection with these sales. 

Income and expenses from real estate operations consisted of rental income and expenses associated with foreclosed properties.  The decline in income and expenses from real estate operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 periods resulted primarily from the transfer in June 2016 of a residential rental property to properties and equipment.  

Included in other revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $  327  ,000   and $1.2 million, respectively, of revenues from a public storage operating facility and $  101,000   and $298,000, respectively, of office facilities revenues from BFC for use of its office space. In June 2016 a student housing facility was transferred from real estate held for sale to property and equipment.  Included in other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $279,000 of rental revenues from the student housing facility. 

Other revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted mainly of $388,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, of income associated with the public storage operating facility and $105,000 and $300,000, respectively, of office facilities revenues from BFC.   

Recoveries from Loan Losses 

Recoveries from loan losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from settlements on charged off loans and recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio.  Recoveries from loan settlements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $10.1 million   and $  16.  2     million, respectively.  Recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were $0.8 million and $  2.5   million,   respectively.  BBX recoveries from loan losses during the 2016 and 2015 periods were generated by legacy loans and due to the nature of these collection activities and the declining balances of legacy loans it is not expected that BBX will generate recoveries consistent with historical amounts.   

Recoveries from loan settlements and the charged off loan portfolio   for the three months ended September   30, 2015 were $  3.4   million and $  800,000  , respectively  .    Recoveries from commercial loan settlements and the charged off loan portfolio for the   nine     months   ended   September   30, 2015 were $  8.8   million and $  3  .8 million, respectively  . 

Asset Impairments/Recoveries 

Asset recoveries during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily resulted from tax certificate recoveries partially offset by a $140,000 impairment on commercial land held for sale. 

Asset impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from impairments on real estate held for sale properties based on updated valuations reflecting executed sales contracts and reductions in listing prices. 

Asset impairments during the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from valuation allowance adjustments of $660,000 on foreclosed commercial real estate properties resulting from updated valuations partially offset by recoveries associated with short sales and payoffs of residential loans held-for-sale.

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Asset impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from recoveries of previously written down loans from short sales and payoffs of residential and small business loans held-for-sale partially offset by valuation allowance adjustments of $1.3 million on foreclosed real estate properties resulting from updated valuations. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

The $3.0 million and $2.1 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same 2015 periods resulted primarily from a $3.6 million civil penalty assessed in the final judgment in the SEC action recognized during the 2015 periods partially offset by higher compensation costs  during the 2016 periods in connection with higher share based compensation expenses associated with the issuance of restricted stock units in September 2015, severance costs and higher salaries and bonuses. The higher salaries were due mainly to new hires and the severance costs resulted from a change in management at an operating property.  

Equity in Net Earnings and Losses of Woodbridge 

BBX recognized e  quity   in earnings of   Woodbridge   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $10.3 million and $22.1 million, respectively, compared to equity in earnings of Woodbridge of $10.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, during the comparable 2015 periods.  Woodbridge s equity earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $36.5 million charge for settlement of the litigation brought by Bluegreen s former shareholders related to Woodbridge s April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen.  As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million settlement reduced BBX s equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The remaining activity of Woodbridge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists primarily of the operations of Bluegreen. 

Bluegreen s net income was $24.4 million and $56.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $27.0 million and $60.9 million, respectively, during the comparable 2015 periods. The lower Bluegreen net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted primarily from special bonuses totaling $10.0 million paid during the second quarter of 2016. The special bonuses were paid to certain Bluegreen employees and BBX Capital s Chief Financial Officer, who was previously an employee of Bluegreen.  There were no special bonuses paid during the 2015 nine month period. The special bonuses were partially offset by increased system-wide sales of vacation ownership interests ( VOIs ) during the 2016 periods. The increase in system-wide sales of VOIs resulted primarily from an increase in the number of total tours, which included an increase in new prospect tours, and an increase in the average sales price per transaction. In addition, during the third quarter of 2016, Bluegreen increased the selling price of VOIs by 5%, resulting in an increase to estimated total gross margins to be generated on the sale of VOI inventory.  Under the relative sales value method prescribed for timeshare developers to relieve the cost of VOI inventory, changes to the estimate of gross margin expected to be generated on the sale of VOI inventory are recognized on a retrospective basis in earnings.  Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2016 Bluegreen recognized a benefit to cost of VOIs sold of $5.6 million ($3.4 million, net of tax).    

Equity in Net Earnings and Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures 

BBX recognized equity in net income of unconsolidated joint ventures of $4.5 million and $5.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and net losses of $158,000 and $753,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are generally real estate joint ventures that develop properties for residential and commercial use. The equity in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect earnings from the closings of single-family homes at two joint ventures.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the joint ventures were in the construction phases and the losses represented primarily marketing and management fees.

Renin     Reportable Segment   Results of Operations   

The following table is a condensed income statement summarizing the results of operations of the Renin   reportable   segment for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 201  6 and 2015 (in thousands)  : 

Trade sales increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 periods due mainly to higher sales of barn door products. The improvement in the gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted primarily from increased sales of higher margin barn door products compared to lower margin wall d cor products. The increase in trade sales was partially offset by the discontinuation of the wall d cor product with a major customer during the third quarter of 2015. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Renin experienced higher selling, general and administrative expenses associated with hiring new management level employees and    increased   severance costs as well as increased consulting and maintenance expenditures   designed   to enhance the product development cycle and improve manufacturing efficiencies. Renin s new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015, Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015 and its CFO hired in April 2016. The above increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower selling and marketing expenses.   

The foreign currency exchange gains or losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 resulted from increases or decreases in value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar.

Sweet Holdings   Results of Operations   

The following table is a condensed income statement summarizing the results of operations of the   Sweet Holdings     reportable   segment for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 201  6 and 2015 (in thousands)  : 

The decrease in trade sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted primarily from lower trade sales at Jer s, and Williams and Bennett partially offset by higher trade sales at Kencraft and Droga as well as higher trade sales at Hoffman s associated with the opening of new retail stores.   

The increase in trade sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted primarily from higher trade sales at Kencraft and Droga as Kencraft was acquired on April 1, 2015 and Droga was acquired on June 1, 2015.   

The lower gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted     primarily from higher trade sales discounts and promotions, as Sweet Holdings is seeking to expand its points of distribution. Inventory markdowns were approximately $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and related primarily to obsolete packaging inventory     at Hoffman s.  Inventory markdowns were approximately $0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and related primarily to Helen Grace obsolete inventory. 

The lower gross margin and gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period resulted primarily from approximately $3.4 million of inventory markdowns during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which related primarily to excess and obsolete inventory compared to $0.6 million of inventory markdowns during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

The decline in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 periods resulted from a $5.0 million principal paydown of the Iberiabank revolving line of credit in July 2016.   

The   lower   selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period reflects   the closing of the Jer s offices in California in June 2016 partially offset by higher compensation, hiring and severance costs associated with hiring industry professionals to integrate and reposition the businesses.    

The higher selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period reflects a charge for approximately   $  0.8 million   associated with the closing and relocation of Jer s sales office and distribution facilities to Kencraft s facilities in Utah  , and costs to enter into new sales channels  . Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 period was on-going     costs to integrate companies and facilities acquired during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 and higher compensation and consulting expense.  The increased compensation expense related to   employee severance   costs,   the hiring of a Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Finance and recruitment  

37   

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

expenses related to   the   hiring of a BBX Sweet Holdings      CEO in October 2016 as well as new   hires   in the sales and marketing departments. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also impacted by higher marketing, advertising, compensation and occupancy costs associated with Hoffman s retail store expansion initiatives.  Further, expenses are being incurred at the Sweet Holdings reportable segment in connection with the opening of additional retail stores and the costs associated with the consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses. It is anticipated that the segment will continue to experience losses as the segment incurs expenses associated with these activities and the continued growth of the segment.

BBX Capital   Consolidated Financial Condition 

BBX Capital s total assets as of September 30, 2016 were $407.2 million compared to $  393.5   million as of December 31, 2015.  The changes in the components of total assets from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 are summarized below: 

Increase in cash resulting primarily from Woodbridge and joint venture dividends, repayments of loans receivable and proceeds from the sales of real estate held-for-sale partially offset by cash used in operating businesses and corporate overhead,       

Decrease in restricted cash associated with land development activities and the repayment of a note payable with the restricted time deposit securing the note payable,      

Lower loans receivable and loans held-for-sale balances due to $22.2 million of loan repayments and $4.6 million of loans transferred as a result of foreclosure to real estate held-for-sale,        

Higher trade receivables due to increased Renin trade receivables associated with installation projects   where   Renin receives payment upon project completion partially offset by lower Sweet Holdings trade receivables   primarily   reflecting trade sales seasonality,            

Decrease   in real estate held-for-sale primarily from   the sale of $17.6 million of   real estate  , transfer of a $6.6 million student housing facility to properties and equipment and impairments of $2.9 million partially offset by the transfer of $11.6 million of real estate held-for-investment to real estate held-for-sale due to land entitlements received on a property and real estate   acquired through foreclosure,      

Increase   in investment in   unconsolidated   real estate joint ventures reflecting   $5.8 million of joint venture equity earnings and $2.4 million of additional investments partially offset by $7.8 million of joint ventures dividends  ,       

Increase in investment in Woodbridge   reflecting $  22.1   million of equity   in   earnings partially offset by   $19.5 million of     dividends,     

Increase in properties and equipment associated with the transfer of a student housing facility to properties and equipment from real estate held-for-sale and the opening of Hoffman s retail stores,     

Increase   in inventory   resulting primarily from increased Renin inventory     partially offset by $3.4 million of Sweet Holdings inventory write-downs,     and     

Decrease in other intangible assets resulting primarily from a $0.4 million impairment in connection with the relocation of the Jer s sales office and distribution facility to Kencraft and amortization   partially offset by a $0.5 million area development fee paid to the   MOD Super Fast Pizza   franchisor  .        

BBX Capital  's total liabilities at   September 30  , 201  6   were $  49.3   million compared to $  57.5   million at December 31, 201  5  .  The changes in the components of total liabilities from   December   31, 201  5   to   September 30  , 20  16   are summarized below: 

Decrease in accounts payable resulting primarily from seasonality,     

Decrease in notes payable associated with a $5.0 million pay-down of the Iberia  bank   revolving line-of-credit and the repayment of a   $1.0 million   note payable with     a restricted time deposit   partially offset by   additional borrowings at Renin,       

Decrease in principal and interest advances on residential loans due to loan and real estate liquidations  , and     

Increase in other liabilities associated with the retirement of Class A Common Stock in connection with BBX Capital s share based compensation withholding tax obligation.        

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

BBX Capital s current assets at   September 30  , 2016 consisted of cash, inventory and trade receivables aggregating $  130.3   million. This does not include $2  3.0   million of current assets held in Renin. BBX Capital had $  17.3   million of current liabilities as of   September 30  , 2016. This does not include $  9.9   million of current liabilities of Renin.  BBX   Capital s principal sources of liquidity are its cash holdings, funds obtained from scheduled payments on loans, loan recoveries, sales of its loans, loan payoffs, sales of real estate held-for-sale, income from income producing real estate, revenues from BBX Sweet Holdings  operations and dividends received from Woodbridge and BBX Capital s investments in real estate joint ventures. Management believes that BBX Capital has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future. 

BBX Capital expects that it will receive dividends from time to time from its 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge.     During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016, BBX Capital received $19.5 million of dividends from Woodbridge.   Distributions must be declared by Woodbridge and approved in advance by both BFC and BBX Capital.  Dividends from Woodbridge will be dependent on and subject to Bluegreen s results of operations and cash flows, as well as restrictions contained in Bluegreen s debt facilities. As a consequence, BBX Capital   may not receive dividends from Woodbridge consistent with prior periods or in the time frames or amounts anticipated, or at all. BBX Capital may also  

39   

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

receive funds from BFC in connection with its tax sharing agreement to the extent BFC utilizes BBX Capital s tax benefits in BFC s consolidated tax return.  BBX Capital also expects to obtain funds in subsequent periods from cash flows on its loans, real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.  BBX Capital also may seek to obtain funds through borrowings or the issuance of equity securities. BBX Capital anticipates utilizing these funds for general corporate purposes, including selling, general and administrative expenses, loan servicing costs, real estate operating expenses, Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings operating expenses and, to the extent of available liquidity, to pursue its business strategy of investing, directly or through joint ventures, in real estate (which may include the acquisition and/or development of real estate) and operating businesses.  BBX Sweet Holdings currently intends to continue to pursue acquisitions in the candy and confections industry and BBX Capital may also pursue acquisitions in other industries. 

BBX Capital has entered into an area development agreement with MOD Super Fast Pizza Franchising, LLC with the goal of developing 50 or more MOD locations throughout Florida over the next seven years, including the major metropolitan markets of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa. MOD   is a national franchisor with   1  60     MOD l  ocations across 18 states and the United Kingdom. 

A significant source of BBX Capital s liquidity is the liquidation of loans and real estate, recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio, cash proceeds from the contribution of properties to real estate joint ventures, dividends from joint ventures and dividends from Woodbridge.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the proceeds from principal repayments and recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio and sales of real estate were   approximately $  42.0   million and $  20.4 million,   respectively.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the proceeds from principal repayments of loans and sales of real estate were approximately $27.0 million and $25.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company received $20.7 million of dividends from Woodbridge.     There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.  

BBX Capital s   Consolidated Contractual Obligations as of   September 30  , 2016 were (in thousands): 

(1) 

Amounts represent scheduled principal payments and do not include interest payments.     

Notes payable as of   September 30  , 2016 consisted of a term loan and   revolving credit advances of Renin with an aggregate balance of $8.2 million, $5.8 million of promissory notes, including promissory notes representing holdback amounts, issued by BBX Sweet Holdings in connection with its acquisitions, and   a term loan and   revolving line-of-credit of BBX Sweet Holdings with aggregate balances of $1.6 million.  Additionally, BBX Sweet Holdings had $5.0 million of available borrowings under its Iberiabank revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2016. 

BBX Capital guarantees certain obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  , which are not included in the contractual obligations table above, and also guarantees certain of the obligations in the above table.    See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Unaudited , for a discussion of BBX Capital s contingent obligations. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September    3  0  , 201  6   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our

Item 1.  Leg    al Proceedings. 

Except as described below, there have been no material changes in our legal proceedings from those disclosed in the  Legal Proceedings  section of our Annual Report in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Shiva Stein, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, v. BBX Capital Corp., John E. Abdo, Norman H. Becker, Steven M. Coldren, Willis N. Holcombe, Jarett S. Levan, Anthony P. Segreto, Charlie C. Winningham, II, BFC Financial Corporation and BBX Merger Subsidiary LLC, Case No. CACE16014713  , Circuit Court of the 17   th   Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. 

On August 10, 2016, Shiva Stein filed a lawsuit against BFC, Merger Sub, BBX Capital and the members of BBX Capital s board of directors, which seeks to establish a class of BBX Capital s shareholders and challenges the currently proposed Merger of BBX Capital with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of BFC.  The plaintiff asserts that the proposed Merger consideration undervalues BBX Capital and is unfair to BBX Capital s public shareholders, that the sales process was unfair and that BBX Capital s directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and candor owed to the public shareholders of BBX Capital because, among other reasons, they failed to take steps to maximize the value of BBX Capital to its public shareholders and instead diverted consideration to themselves. The lawsuit also alleges that BFC, as the controlling shareholder of BBX Capital, breached its fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and candor owed to the public shareholders of BBX Capital by utilizing confidential, non-public information to formulate the Merger consideration and not acting in the best interests of BBX Capital s public shareholders. In addition, the lawsuit includes a cause of action against BBX Capital, BFC and Merger Sub for aiding and abetting the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.   The lawsuit requests that the court grant an injunction blocking the proposed Merger or, if the proposed Merger is completed, rescind the transaction or award damages as determined by the court.  BFC and BBX Capital believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action. 

A second lawsuit which sought to challenge the merger and included many of the same claims as set forth in the   Stein   action described above was filed in the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida during September 2016. This lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice during October 2016. 

Securities and Exchange Commission v. BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and Alan B. Levan, Case No. 12-60082-CV-SCOLA, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida  

On January 18, 2012, the SEC brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan, BBX Capital s then-serving Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, alleging that they violated securities laws by not timely disclosing known adverse trends in BBX Capital s commercial real estate loans, selectively disclosing problem loans and engaging in improper accounting treatment of certain specific loans which may have resulted in a material understatement of its net loss in BBX Capital s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Further, the complaint alleged that Mr. Alan B. Levan intentionally misled investors in related earnings calls. The Court denied summary judgment as to most issues, but granted the SEC s motion for partial summary judgment that certain statements in one of Alan Levan s answers on a July 25, 2007 investor conference call were false.  On December 15, 2014, after a six-week trial, the jury found in favor of BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan with respect to the disclosures made during an April 2007 earnings conference call and in BBX Capital s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the 2007 first and second quarters, but found that they had engaged in an act of fraud or deceit toward shareholders or prospective investors by making materially false statements knowingly or with severe recklessness (1) with respect to three statements in the July 25, 2007 conference call referenced above, and (2) in their decision to sell certain loans in the fourth quarter of 2007 and failing to classify the loans as held-for sale in the 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The jury also found that Mr. Alan B. Levan made or caused to be made false statements to the independent accountants regarding the held for sale issue.

BBX CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The SEC sought a final judgment: (i) permanently barring Mr. Alan B. Levan from serving as an officer or director of any SEC reporting company; (ii) imposing civil penalties of $5.2 million against BBX Capital and $1.56 million against Mr. Alan B. Levan; and (iii) permanently restraining BBX Capital and Mr. Alan B. Levan from violating securities laws.  On September 24, 2015, the court entered a final judgment denying the SEC s request for a permanent bar from Mr. Alan B. Levan serving as an officer or director of any public company, but instead ordered Mr. Alan B. Levan barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of two years commencing on December 23, 2015. As a result of the court s decision, on December 23, 2015, Mr. Alan B. Levan resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital, as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BFC, and as a director of BBX Capital and BFC.  The court also imposed monetary penalties of $4,550,000 against BBX Capital and $1,300,000 against Mr. Alan B. Levan.    As a result of the bar order, Mr. Alan B. Levan resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital, as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BFC, and as a director of BBX Capital and BFC.  Mr. Alan B. Levan continues to serve BFC and BBX Capital in a non-executive capacity as Founder and strategic advisor to each company s board of directors. 

On September 28, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the pretrial summary judgment described above and set aside the judgment of the district court.  The reversal, once final, will terminate the financial penalties and set aside the two year officer and director bar imposed against Mr. Alan B. Levan.  The court remanded the case for a new trial on the two claims stripped of the summary judgment. The SEC has the right to seek a retrial of the two claims. The order entered by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals will not be final until the time to file motions for rehearing expire or any filed motions for rehearing are denied. Once the decision is final, it is expected that Mr. Alan B. Levan will be re-appointed as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BFC and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital.

I have reviewed this     quarterly   report     on Form 10-  Q   of B  BX Capital Corporation  ;     

2. 

Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;      

3. 

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;     

4. 

The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:     

a. 

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;     

b. 

designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;     

c. 

evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;   and        

d. 

disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter   (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report)   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and     

5. 

The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):     

a. 

all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      

b. 

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
