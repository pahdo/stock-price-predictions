Note 1. Organization and Description of Business 
  Description of Business

The Company provides a simple, personalized, and powerful way for employees to shop for and manage their health care. At the same time, the Company enables employers to understand their employees  needs and guide them to the right care, right providers and right programs at the right time.

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in January 2008. The Company s principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the information herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of Castlight and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period.  
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K that have had a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of the relative selling prices for the Company s products and services  , certain assumptions used in the valuation of the Company s equity awards, annual bonus attainment and the capitalization and estimated useful life of internal-use software development costs.   Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
    
    In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-1,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The guidance clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows and how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted in any interim period. The Company is evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. At this point in time, the Company does not intend to adopt the standard early. 
    
  Credit Losses 
  
    5 

     Table of Contents  
  CASTLIGHT HEALTH, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (unaudited) 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020 and earlier adoption is permitted beginning 2019. The Company is evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. At this point in time, the Company does not intend to adopt the standard early. 
  Stock-based Compensation 
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.  The guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.   The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. Accordingly, the standard is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, and the Company has   elected not to early adopt. Based on the Company s evaluation,   the standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  The guidance will require lessees to put all leases on their balance sheets, whether operating or financing, while continuing to recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. The guidance states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. At this point in time, the Company does not intend to adopt the standard early. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-1,  Financial Instruments.  The guidance provides a new measurement alternative for equity investments that don t have readily determinable fair values and don t qualify for the net asset value practical expedient. Under this alternative, these investments can be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment if the same issuer. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and earlier adoption is not permitted. The Company is evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption at this point in time. 
    
  Cloud Computing Arrangements 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.  The guidance is intended to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement, primarily to determine whether the arrangement includes a sale or license of software. The Company   adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 and it   does not impact the Company s financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The guidance provides principles   for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard for all entities by one year. The standard will become effective for the annual reporting period (including interim reporting periods) beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods

(including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. At this point in time, the Company does not intend to adopt the standard early. 

Note 3. Marketable Securities 
    
  All of the Company s cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as  available-for-sale  securities. These securities are reported at fair value, with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders  equity. 
    
     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, marketable securities consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Note 4. Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy that requires that the Company maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value: 
  Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
  Level 2 Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 
  Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. 
  The fair value of marketable securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are

observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from a third-party pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established third party pricing vendors and broker-dealers. There have been no changes in valuation techniques in the periods presented. The Company has no financial assets or liabilities measured using Level 3 inputs. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The following tables present information about the Company s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the above input categories (in thousands): 

Gross unrealized gains and losses for cash equivalents and marketable securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were not material. The Company does not believe the unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on the Company s evaluation of available evidence as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  There were   no   realized gains or losses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . All of the Company s marketable securities at   September 30, 2016   mature within   one year  . As of   December 31, 2015  , those securities with maturities greater than one year are reflected in the noncurrent portion of the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities on the balance sheets consist of securities with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of greater than three months, and the remainder of the securities is reflected in cash and cash equivalents.

Depreciation and amortization expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $0.8 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively  .   Depreciation and amortization expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $2.4 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively  .   Depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight-line basis. 

Note 6. Related Party Transactions and Variable Interest Entity 
    
  In the second quarter of 2015, the Company announced a strategic alliance with Lyra Health ( Lyra ), to develop and bring to market an integrated behavioral health solution. In connection with this strategic alliance, the Company made an initial preferred stock investment in Lyra of   $3.1 million   and its   chief executive officer, Dr. Colella, joined the Lyra board.     Additionally, the Company made a subsequent preferred stock investment in Lyra of   $1.0 million   in August 2015  .   In March 2016, the Company amended the strategic alliance to modify the manner in which the Company collaborates with Lyra on the solution. In connection with this amendment, Dr. Colella ceased service on the Lyra board of directors. Lyra is considered a related party to the Company because two of the Company s directors, Dr. Roberts and Mr. Ebersman, serve on the Lyra board of directors and Mr. Ebersman is the Lyra chief executive officer. An independent committee of the Company s board of directors, comprised of directors without any involvement in any external behavioral health business initiatives, approved the strategic alliance with and investment in Lyra. 
       
  The Company has evaluated all its transactions with Lyra and has determined that Lyra is a variable interest entity ( VIE ) for the Company. In determining that the Company is not the VIE s primary beneficiary, the Company considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the characteristics of the Company s involvement; and the obligation or likelihood for the Company to provide incremental financial support. Based on the Company s evaluation, the Company determined it is not required to consolidate the operations of the VIE. The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this unconsolidated VIE is limited to its investment of   $4.1 million   and it is not obligated to provide incremental financial support to Lyra. 
    
  The investment in Lyra is accounted for under the cost method and is included under other assets in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company has not estimated the fair value of its investment because there have been no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The Company assesses its investment for impairment on a quarterly basis or based on facts or circumstances that may require it to reassess the fair value of its investment. Based on the facts and circumstances as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company concluded that its investment was appropriately valued.

Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal Matters  
  On April 2, April 16, April 29, and May 4, 2015, purported securities class action lawsuits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, against the Company, certain of its current and former directors, executive officers, significant stockholders and underwriters associated with its initial public offering ( IPO ). The lawsuits, which were consolidated on July 22, 2015, were brought by purported stockholders of the Company seeking to represent a class consisting of all those who purchased the Company s stock pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with its IPO. A consolidated complaint ( Complaint ) was filed on July 23, 2015, alleging claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. On September 22, 2015 the Company filed a demurrer to the Complaint. After briefing and argument, the Court overruled the demurrer as to Plaintiffs  claims under Sections 11 and 15 and granted with leave to amend, the demurrer to Plaintiff s claims under Section 12(a)(2). Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint ( Amended Complaint ) on November 10, 2015. On December 10, 2015, the Company filed a demurrer to the Section 12(a)(2) claim in the Amended Complaint. On January 28, 2016, the Court again sustained the demurrer to the Section 12(a)(2) claim in the amended Complaint. The Amended Complaint sought unspecified damages and other relief. On March 28, 2016, the parties to the consolidated actions reached a mutually acceptable resolution by way of a mediated cash settlement. The aggregate amount of the settlement under the agreement in principle is   $9.5 million  . The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 13, 2016, and the Court granted final approval of the settlement on October 28, 2016. As a result of the settlement the Company recorded a net charge of   $2.9 million   to general and administrative expense in 2016. This amount represents the portion of settlement that was not covered by insurance and legal fees incurred in 2016 regarding this matter. Funds representing the Company s portion of the settlement amount were moved to escrow in the third quarter of 2016 and the Company expects them to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the litigation, the Company is satisfied with this resolution given the risks and expenses associated with further litigation. The Company accrues for loss contingencies when it is both probable that it will incur the loss and when it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss.   
  From time to time, the Company may become subject to other legal proceedings, claims or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company may receive letters alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur in litigation, the impact could be material to the Company s business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations, depending on the specific circumstances of the outcome.  
       
  Leases and Contractual Obligations 
    
  The Company s principal commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity. The Company s existing lease agreements provide it with the option to renew and generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company s future operating lease obligations would change if it entered into additional operating lease agreements as the Company expands its operations and if it exercised these options.

The Company leases two office spaces in San Francisco, California with expirations dates in 2017 and 2021, respectively. In anticipation of the expiration of the lease in 2017, the Company executed an amendment in September 2016 to extend the term of its other lease to 2022 and add incremental rentable square feet ( RSF ). As a result of the amendment, the Company s office space increased by 8,247 RSF. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s future minimum payments for all leases are   $18.5 million  .  
    
  Other than matters discussed above there were no other material changes in the Company s contractual obligations from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Please see Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of its contractual obligations. 

Note 9. Stock Compensation 
  Stock Options Activity 
  A summary of stock option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):    

The total grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.6 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively.  
  The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $13.5 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.2   years. 
    
    The options granted and canceled in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   in the table above include options that were exchanged under the Company s stock option exchange program. Pursuant to the stock option exchange program,   108   out of   132   eligible employees tendered options covering an aggregate of   2,685,396   shares of the Company s Class A and Class B common stock at a weighted average exercise price of   $11.03  , in exchange for options to purchase   2,685,396   shares of its Class B common stock at an exercise price of   $2.99   per share, the closing sale price reported on the New York Stock Exchange on   February 24, 2016  . Each new grant began a new vesting period commencing on the date of grant over   five   years in equal monthly installments. As of   February 15, 2016   the incremental expense related to this offer was   $1.8 million  , which will be recognized over   five   years.

  Restricted Stock Units 
    
    A summary of restricted stock unit activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is as follows: 
   
 (1) Includes performance stock units ( PSUs ) that were granted in 2016. 
  (2) Includes PSUs that were granted in the prior year, which were canceled because performance targets were not achieved.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was a total of   $49.0 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units and performance stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   3.1   years. 
    
  In February 2016, the Company awarded PSUs to certain employees. The number of shares that will eventually vest depends on achievement of performance targets for 2016, as determined by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors, and may range from 0 to 150% of the targeted award amount. Once the performance is determined and a targeted award amount is fixed, the target number of PSUs, if any, will vest in eight quarterly installments, subject to recipients' continued service, beginning on February 16, 2017. The compensation expense associated with the PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. No expense has been recorded through   September 30, 2016   as the Company determined the achievement of the performance targets was not probable. 
   
  Note 10. Stockholders  Equity  
  Common Stock 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   54,323,980   shares of Class A common stock and   49,368,701   shares of Class B common stock outstanding. 
  Transactions with SAP Technologies, Inc. 
    
  In May 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Securities Purchase Agreement ) with SAP Technologies, Inc. ( SAP ) pursuant to which it sold and issued to SAP   4.7 million   shares ( Shares ) of its Class B Common Stock and a warrant ( Warrant ) to purchase up to   1.9 million   shares of its Class B Common Stock. The net proceeds from this transaction were $17.8 million and will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
  The exercise price of the Warrant is   $4.91   per share and will expire four years from the date the Company enters into agreements with SAP related to both SAP s Connected Health platform (the  Platform Agreement ) and SAP s distribution of the Company s solutions (the  Distribution Agreement , and together, with the Platform Agreement, the  Alliance Agreements ). The Alliance Agreements will be focused on a strategic, multi-pronged business relationship aimed at delivering integrated healthcare technologies that can help lower healthcare costs, improve outcomes and increase benefits satisfaction for customers. If the Company does not enter into the Alliance Agreements with SAP by May 17, 2017, then the Warrant will become void.  
  The Shares and Warrant are considered freestanding instruments from each other and are classified within stockholders  equity. The Company preliminarily allocated the net proceeds to the Shares and Warrant and also to a customer prepayment liability classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities that represents the future benefits of the Alliance Agreements. Additional accounting for the Warrants and the customer prepayment liability is dependent on, if and when, the Alliance Agreements are executed.

Note 11. Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   zero   percent, primarily as a result of the estimated tax loss for the year and the change in valuation allowance. At   September 30, 2016  , all unrecognized tax benefits are subject to a full valuation allowance and, if recognized, will not affect the effective tax rate.  

Note 12. Net Loss per Share 
  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period  .   Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including Preferred Stock and outstanding stock options and warrants, to the extent dilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented as the inclusion of all potential shares of common stock outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. 
  Net loss is allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common stock as if the earnings for the year have been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the net loss is allocated on a proportionate basis.  
  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the Company s common stock (in thousands, except per share data): 

The following securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for common stock because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented (in thousands):

Note 13. Reduction in Workforce 
    
    On   May 10, 2016  ,   the Company s Board of Directors committed to a   program to reduce the Company s     workforce in order to   reduce expenses,   align   its   operations with evolving business needs and improve efficiencies. Under this program,   the Company undertook an initiative to reduce     its   workforce by approximately   fourteen percent  . F  or the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred charges of   $0.1 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively,   all of which were related to severance costs  . A  s of   September 30, 2016  , the total has been fully paid out.

Overview 
       
  Castlight offers a health benefits platform that engages employees to make better health care decisions and enables employers to communicate and measure their benefit programs. We provide a simple, personalized, and powerful way for employees to shop for and manage their health care. At the same time, we enable employers to understand their employees  needs and guide them to the right care, right providers and right programs at the right time. Our comprehensive technology offering aggregates complex, large-scale data and applies sophisticated analytics to make health care data transparent and useful. Our products are designed to deliver strong employee engagement and can be used to enable employers to integrate disparate benefit programs into a single platform available to employees and their families. Ultimately, we help enable organizations and their employees to improve outcomes, lower health care costs, and increase benefits satisfaction. 
    
  Since our inception in 2008, we have been committed to improving the efficiency of the U.S. health care industry. From 2008 to 2010, we focused our efforts on research and development to build our consumer health care database, our analytic capabilities and the initial version of our cloud-based product which constitutes our core Castlight platform. After its release in 2010, we have continued to enhance that product, as well as release new products, including Castlight Pharmacy, Castlight Dental, Castlight Action, Castlight Elevate, Castlight Protect, and Castlight Rewards. These products are delivered to our customers, and their employees and families, via our cloud-based offering and leverage consumer-oriented design principles that drive engagement and ease of use. 
    
  We market and sell our health benefits platform to self-insured companies in a broad range of industries and to governmental entities. We sell our offering solely in the United States, and we market to our customers and potential customers through our direct sales force, as well as through relationships with health plans, benefits consultants and other channel partners.

     Table of Contents  

We intend to continue to invest aggressively in the success of our customers, expand our commercial operations and further develop our offering. As a result of these and other factors, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financings in order to fund our operations.    
  Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
    
    Sales of New and Additional Products.   Our revenue growth rate and long-term profitability are affected by our ability to sell new and additional products to our customer base. To date, a substantial majority of our revenue has come from sales of subscriptions to our core Castlight platform. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell subscriptions to other products as our customers become more familiar with our offering and seek to address additional needs.           
  Renewals of Customer Contracts.   We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their subscription revenue growth over time will be an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships.           
    Implementation Timelines.   Our ability to convert backlog into revenue and improve our gross margin depends on how quickly we complete customer implementations. Our implementation timelines vary from customer to customer based on the source and condition of the data we receive from third parties, the configurations that we agree to provide and the size of the customer. Our implementation timelines for our core Castlight platform are typically three to nine months after entering into an agreement with a customer. Our implementation timelines for our other products currently range from approximately three to twelve months.           
  Professional Services Model.   We believe our professional services capabilities support the adoption of our subscription offerings. As a result, our sales efforts have been focused primarily on our subscription offering, rather than the profitability of our professional services business. Our professional services are generally priced on a fixed-fee basis and the costs incurred to complete these services, which consist mainly of personnel-related costs, have been greater than the amount charged to the customer. We also do not have standalone value for our implementation services for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we recognize implementation services revenue in the same manner as the associated subscription revenue. Prior to launching an individual customer, we incur significant costs associated with implementation activities, which we record as cost of revenue. Since we do not recognize significant revenues from an individual customer until we launch, we generate a negative gross margin at the customer level during the implementation period.           
  Seasonality.   A significantly higher proportion of our customers enter into new subscription agreements with us in the third and fourth quarters of the year, compared to the first and second quarters. The impact from this seasonality is not immediately apparent in our revenue because we do not begin recognizing revenue from new customer agreements until we have implemented our offering, based on the implementation timelines discussed above.  
      
  Revenue recognized in any quarter is primarily from customer agreements entered into in prior quarters. In addition, the mix of customers paying monthly, quarterly, or annually varies from quarter to quarter and impacts our deferred revenue balance. As a result of variability in our billing and implementation timelines, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total value of our customer contracts, nor do changes in deferred revenue serve as a reliable indicator of our future subscription revenue. 
  Key Business Metrics 
  We review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, and make strategic decisions. 
    
  Signed Annual Recurring Revenue  

15 

     Table of Contents  

Revenue recognized in any quarter is largely derived from customer agreements signed in prior quarters. Accordingly, management measures sales performance and forecasts future subscription revenue based on signed Annual Recurring Revenue ( ARR ). ARR is a forward-looking metric based on contractual terms in existence as of the applicable ARR measurement date and is subject to change resulting from a number of factors including, but not limited to, addition of new customers, changes in user counts, terminations or non-renewals, as well as upsells and cross-sells. As discussed above,   we begin recognizing revenue from new customer agreements when we have implemented our offering  , which can take from approximately three to twelve months after entering into an agreement with a customer.  
  ARR represents the annualized value of subscription revenue under contract with customers at the end of a quarter, which we refer to for this purpose as a measurement date. To calculate ARR, we first calculate the annualized subscription value for each signed customer (whether implemented or not), as of the applicable measurement date, by multiplying the monthly contract value of the subscription services under contract by 12. We exclude from this calculation any customers that have provided us with formal notice of termination or non-renewal as of the measurement date. ARR does not take into account the (i) potential for customers to terminate, or decline to renew, their agreements with us, (ii) achievement of non-recurring or yet-to-be-earned performance guarantees, (iii) one-time engagement bonuses included within our customer contracts or (iv) revenues related to professional services, such as implementation and communications services. ARR is not determined in reference to GAAP. 
    
  Our ARR at   September 30, 2016   was   $118.1 million  , compared to   $103.0 million   at   September 30, 2015  , representing an increase of approximately   15%  . We expect   ARR   to increase as we sign additional customers and cross-sell to existing customers. 
    
  Annual Net Dollar Retention Rate 

We assess our performance on customer retention by measuring our Annual Net Dollar Retention rate ( NDR ). We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their subscription revenue growth over time will be an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. Our NDR provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of our additional products to existing customers, increases in user count for existing customers and customer renewals, as offset by terminations or pricing changes. We observed an annual net dollar retention rate of   116%   and   103%   for our signed customer base, for the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. We calculate NDR for a given period as the aggregate annualized subscription contract value as of the last day of that year from those customers that were also customers as of the last day of the prior year, divided by the aggregate annualized subscription contract value from all customers as of the last day of the prior year. In calculating NDR, we exclude one-time fees. NDR does not include subscriptions by new customers contracted since the end of the most recently completed year. We expect NDR to be approximately 100% for the year ended   December 31, 2016  . 

Components of Results of Operations 
  Revenue 
  We generate revenue from subscription fees from customers for access to the products they select, including basic customer service support. We also earn revenue from professional services primarily related to the implementation of our offering, including extensive communications support to drive adoption by our customers  employees and their dependents. Historically, we have derived a substantial majority of our subscription revenue from our core Castlight platform. Our subscription fees are based primarily on the number of employees and adult dependents that employers identify as eligible to use our offering, which typically includes all of our customers  U.S. employees and adult dependents that receive health benefits. 
  
    16 

     Table of Contents  

We recognize subscription fees on a straight-line basis ratably over the contract term beginning when our products are implemented and ready for launch, which is based on the implementation timelines discussed above. Our customer agreements generally have a term of three years. We generally invoice our customers in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts that have not been invoiced are not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We generally invoice our implementation services upon contract signing on a fixed-fee basis, which is generally when we commence work.  
   As a result of variability in our billing terms, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total value of our customer contracts, nor do changes in deferred revenue serve as a reliable indicator of our future subscription revenue in a given period.  
  Costs of Revenue  
  Cost of revenue consists of the cost of subscription revenue and cost of professional services revenue. 
  Cost of subscription revenue primarily consists of data fees, employee-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation), hosting costs of our cloud-based service, cost of subcontractors, expenses for service delivery (which includes call center support), allocated overhead, amortization of internal-use software and depreciation of owned computer equipment and software. 
  Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of employee-related expenses (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation) associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel costs and allocated overhead. The time and costs of our customer implementations vary based on the source and condition of the data we receive from third parties, the configurations that we agree to provide and the size of the customer.  
  Our cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs. However, the related revenue is deferred until our products are ready for use by the customer and then recognized as revenue ratably over the related contract term. Therefore, we expense the cost incurred to provide our products and services prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.  
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses.  
  Sales and Marketing.   Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including salaries, sales commissions and bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation), travel-related expenses, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Commissions earned by our sales force and broker fees that can be associated specifically with the noncancelable portion of a subscription contract are deferred and amortized over the noncancelable period. Accordingly, commission expense can be materially impacted by changes in the termination provisions of customer contracts that we execute in a given period compared with previous periods. 
    
  Research and Development.   Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation), costs associated with subcontractors and allocated overhead. 
  General and Administrative.   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation) for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses  and allocated overhead. 
  Overhead Allocation.   Expenses associated with our facilities and IT costs are allocated between cost of revenues and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.

Results of Operations 
  The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenue for each of the periods indicated: 

Revenue 

Total r  evenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $6.0 million  , or   31%  , attributable to new customer launches that occurred in the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   that contributed $3.0 million of the increase in total revenue year over year, and existing customer launches of cross-sell products which contributed $3.0 million of the increase. Our launched customer base grew more than 10% year over year.  
  Total revenue f  or the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $17.8 million  , or   33%  , attributable to new customer launches that occurred in the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   that contributed $6.6 million of the increase in total revenue year over year, and existing customer launches of cross-sell products which contributed $11.2 million of the increase. Our launched customer base grew more than 10% year over year. 
    
  Costs and Operating Expenses

     Table of Contents  

Cost of subscription revenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $0.9 million  , or   29%  ,   primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in employee-related expenses as we realigned our operations to support our growing customer base, a $0.2 million increase in third party service fees related to the expansion of our call center and a $0.2 million increase in amortization expense of internally developed software.  
  Cost of subscription revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $3.7 million  , or   43%  ,   primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in employee-related expenses as we realigned our operations to support our growing customer base, a $0.7 million increase in amortization expense of internally developed software related to our newest products, a $0.3 million increase in third party service fees related to the expansion of our call center and a $0.3 million increase in data cost expense as we continue to invest in data infrastructure to enable more efficient implementations. Overhead expenses allocated into cost of subscription revenue accounted for $0.3 million of the increase, primarily related to an increase in rent expense attributable to new office spaces leased in the prior year. 
    
  Cost of professional services revenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.6 million  , or   29%  , primarily due to   a $1.3 million decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of the reduction in workforce in the second quarter of 2016 and a $0.2 million decrease in third party service fees as we gained efficiencies in the use of internal resources to launch customers.  
    
  Cost of professional services revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.6 million  , or   11%  , primarily due to   a $0.9 million decrease in third party service fees as we gained efficiencies in use of internal resources to launch customers and a $0.6 million decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of the reduction in workforce in the second quarter of 2016.  
   Gross margin for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   improved primarily   due to revenue growth of   31%   compared to an   8%   decrease in associated costs.   Gross margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   improved primarily   due to revenue growth of   33%   compared to   8%   growth in associated costs.   We expect to continue to see favorable overall gross margin trends as we continue to grow   the number of launched customers in relation to customers in the implementation phase.  
    
  Sales and Marketing

     Table of Contents  

Sales and marketing expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $3.6 million  , or   21%  , primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in employee-related expenses and a $0.2 million decrease in recruiting expense due to the reduction in workforce that took place in the second quarter of 2016. Also contributing to the decrease was a $0.5 million reduction in marketing spend as we leveraged our channel relationships. 
    
  Sales and marketing expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $6.0 million  , or   12%  , primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in employee-related expenses due to the reduction in workforce that took place in the second quarter of 2016 and a $2.2 million decrease in marketing spend as we leveraged our channel relationships.  
    
  Research and Development 

Research and development expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $2.7 million  , or   34%  , primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in employee-related expenses as we continue to invest in R D resources to drive innovation and a $1.0 million increase in expense resulting from the non-recurrence of capitalized expenditures that occurred in the prior year.  
    
  Research and development expense   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $8.8 million  , or   40%  , primarily attributable to a $6.0 million increase in employee-related expenses as we continue to invest in R D resources to drive innovation, a $1.8 million increase in expense resulting from the non-recurrence of capitalized expenditures that occurred in the prior year and a $0.5 million increase in expense related to the use of contractors to assist in our development efforts, such as the releases of new features and functionality on existing products.  
    
  General and Administrative 

General and administrative expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.0 million  , or   15%  , primarily attributable to a $0.3 million decrease in contractor expense as we gained the benefit of our systems and infrastructure investments, a $0.3 million decrease in employee-related expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in recruiting expense as a result of a decrease in hiring efforts due to the reduction in workforce in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  General and administrative expense   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $1.6 million  , or   9%  , primarily attributable to a net charge of $2.9 million recorded in 2016 related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit. Refer to Note 8 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in contractor expense as we gained the benefit of our systems and infrastructure investments.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

20 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling   $116.4 million  , which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of U.S. agency obligations,   U.S. treasury securities and money market funds.  
  Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, payments from our customers. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, our expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our cloud-based products.   Although we currently are not a party to any agreement and do not have any understanding with any third parties with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, businesses or technologies, w  e may in the future enter into these types of arrangements. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
  Operating Activities 
  Cash used in operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $35.3 million   and   $44.9 million  , respectively. The decrease in cash used is primarily as a result of a decrease in net loss from   $60.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $49.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was adjusted for   $22.2 million   in non-cash expenses that included stock-based compensation of   $16.3 million   and amortization of deferred commissions of   $3.2 million  . Working capital uses of cash included a decrease in accrued expenses of   $4.0 million  , primarily as a result of payout of annual bonuses to our employees in the first quarter of 2016 and a   $2.9 million   settlement charge for a class action lawsuit, recorded in 2016. These decreases were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of   $3.1 million  , as a result of timing of billings and collections. Additionally, deferred revenue increased by   $3.3 million  , primarily as a result of an increase in the amount billed year over year due to an increase in   launched customers. 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash provided by investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $51.4 million   and   $50.1 million  , respectively. This increase was primarily attributable to our   investment of   $4.1 million   in Lyra Health, a behavioral health technology company, in the second quarter of 2015 as well as the non-recurrence of capitalized expenditures of   $1.9 million  .   The increase in cash provided was primarily offset by the timing of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, the net result of which was   $53.0 million  , and   $58.7 million  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively.  
  Financing Activities 
  Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $19.8 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively. This increase was primarily related to proceeds from issuance of common stock and warrants to   SAP Technologies, Inc.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity. Our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew and generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations and if we exercised these options.  
    
  We lease two office spaces in San Francisco, California with expirations dates in 2017 and 2021, respectively. In anticipation of the expiration of the lease in 2017, we executed an amendment in September 2016 to extend the term of our other lease to 2022 and add incremental rentable square feet ( RSF ). As a result of the amendment, our office space increased by 8,247 RSF. As of September 30, 2016, our future minimum payments for all leases are $18.5 million.   
  There were no material changes in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Please see Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our contractual obligations. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Sensitivity 
  We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling   $116.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and $  133.8   million as of   December 31, 2015  . This amount was invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. All our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. 
  Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our marketable securities as  available for sale , no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. 
  An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $  0.2 million   market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . All of our investments earn less than 100-basis points and as a result, an immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $  0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the supervision and participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
    
  Based on our management s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II.  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
  On April 2, April 16, April 29, and May 4, 2015, purported securities class action lawsuits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, against us, certain of our current and former directors, executive officers, significant stockholders and underwriters associated with our initial public offering ( IPO ). The lawsuits, which were consolidated on July 22, 2015, were brought by purported stockholders of our company seeking to represent a class consisting of all those who purchased our stock pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with our IPO. A consolidated complaint ( Complaint ) was filed on July 23, 2015, alleging claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. On September 22, 2015 we filed a demurrer to the Complaint. After briefing and argument, the Court overruled the demurrer as to Plaintiffs  claims under Sections 11 and 15 and granted with leave to amend, the demurrer to Plaintiff s claims under Section 12(a)(2). Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint ( Amended Complaint ) on November 10, 2015. On December 10, 2015, we filed a demurrer to the Section 12(a)(2) claim in the Amended Complaint. On January 28, 2016, the Court again sustained the demurrer to the Section 12(a)(2) claim in the amended Complaint. The Amended Complaint sought unspecified damages and other relief. On March 28, 2016, the parties to the consolidated actions reached a mutually acceptable resolution by way of a mediated cash settlement. The aggregate amount of the settlement under the agreement in principle is   $9.5 million  . The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 13, 2016, and the Court granted final approval of the settlement on October 28, 2016. As a result of the settlement the Company recorded a net charge of   $2.9 million   to general and administrative expense in 2016. This amount represents the portion of settlement that was not covered by insurance and legal fees incurred in 2016 regarding this matter. Funds representing our portion of the settlement amount were moved to escrow in the third quarter of 2016 and we expect them to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the litigation, the Company is satisfied with this resolution given the risks and expenses associated with further litigation. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss.   
  From time to time, the Company may become subject to other legal proceedings, claims or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we may receive letters alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur in litigation, the impact could be material to our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations, depending on the specific circumstances of the outcome.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our  
  
    23 

     Table of Contents  

business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class B common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
  Risks Related to Our Business 
  We have a history of significant losses, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 
  We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our incorporation in 2008 and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We experienced net losses of   $79.9 million  ,   $85.9 million   and   $62.2 million  , during the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively and   $49.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an accumulated deficit of   $346.5 million  .   The losses and accumulated deficit were primarily due to the substantial investments we made to grow our business, enhance our technology and offering through research and development and acquire and support customers. We anticipate that cost of revenue and operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we seek to continue to grow our business, enhance our offering and acquire customers. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue from our business are new and unproven, and any failure to increase our revenue or generate revenue from new products and services could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we could also incur increased losses because costs associated with entering into customer agreements are generally incurred up front, while customers are generally billed over the term of the agreement. Our prior losses, combined with our expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders  equity and working capital. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis, or if we do, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. As a result of these factors, we may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations, which could be dilutive to stockholders, and such capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 
  Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. 
  We were founded in 2008, began building the first version of our core Castlight platform in 2009, did not complete our first customer sale and implementation until 2010 and did not make substantial investments in sales and marketing until 2012. Our limited operating history limits our ability to forecast our future operating results and such forecasts are subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. 
  We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by new and growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market adoption of our existing and future offerings, competition from other companies, acquiring and retaining customers, managing customer deployments, hiring, integrating, training and retaining skilled personnel, developing new products and services, determining prices for our products, unforeseen expenses and challenges in forecasting accuracy. If our assumptions regarding these and other similar risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change as we gain more experience operating our business or due to changes in our industry, or if we do not address these risks and uncertainties successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. 
  In addition, we may need to change our current operations infrastructure in order for us to achieve profitability and scale our operations efficiently, which makes our future prospects even more difficult to evaluate. For example, in order to grow sales of our health benefits platform to smaller customers in a financially sustainable manner, we may need to further automate implementations, tailor our offering and modify our go-to-market approaches to reduce our service delivery and customer acquisition costs. If we fail to implement these changes on a timely basis or are unable to implement them effectively, our business may suffer. 
    
  The market for our offering is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, or if our offering does not drive employee engagement, the growth of our business will be harmed. 
  Our market is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market adoption. Our success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of employers to increase their use of our health benefits platform, the ability of our products to increase employee engagement, as well as on our ability to demonstrate the  
  
    24 

     Table of Contents  

value of our offering to customers and their employees and to develop new products that provide value to customers and users. If employers do not perceive the benefits of our offering or our offering does not drive employee engagement, then our market might develop more slowly than we expect or even shrink, which could significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we have limited insight into trends that might develop and affect our business. We might make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business, legal and regulatory trends, which could harm our business. If any of these events occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
  If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access to a customer s data are obtained, our offering may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, our reputation may be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. 
  Our offering involves the storage and transmission of customers  proprietary information, personally identifiable information, and protected health information of our customers  employees and their dependents, which is regulated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, collectively HIPAA. Because of the extreme sensitivity of this information, the security features of our offering are very important. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive customer or employee data, including HIPAA-regulated protected health information. A security breach or failure could result from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, and catastrophic events. 
  If our security measures were to be breached or fail, our reputation could be severely damaged, adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, customers may curtail their use of or stop using our offering and our business may suffer. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, penalties and regulatory actions for violation of HIPAA and other laws or regulations applicable to data protection and significant costs for remediation and for measures to prevent future occurrences. In addition, any potential security breach could result in increased costs associated with liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage that may have been caused by such breaches, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain the business relationships after a breach and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences, including organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. While we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident. 
  We outsource important aspects of the storage and transmission of customer information, and thus rely on third parties to manage functions that have material cyber-security risks. These outsourced functions include services such as software design and product development, software engineering, database consulting, call center operations, co-location data centers, data-center security, IT, network security and Web application firewall services. We attempt to address these risks by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle customer information to sign business associate agreements contractually requiring those subcontractors to adequately safeguard personal health data and in some cases by requiring such outsourcing subcontractors to undergo third-party security examinations. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures and other safeguards will adequately protect us from the risks associated with the storage and transmission of customers proprietary and protected health information. 
  We may experience cyber-security and other breach incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, in the event that our customers authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their employees on our systems, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such data in our systems as we would not control access. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, or if we are unable to effectively resolve such breaches in a timely manner, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers or suffer other reputational harm. 
  Our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management s attention from leading our business.

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our Class B common stock. 
  Our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross margin, net loss and cash flows, may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, those listed elsewhere in this  Risk Factors  section and those listed below: 
             
    the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations of such customers; 
                
    seasonal and other variations in the timing of the sales of our offering, as a significantly higher proportion of our customers enter into new subscription agreements with us or renew previous agreements in the third and fourth quarters of the year compared to the first and second quarters; 
                
    the timing of recognition of revenue, including possible delays in the recognition of revenue due to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable implementation timelines; 
                
    failure to meet our contractual commitments under service-level agreements with our customers; 
                
    the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; 
                
    our access to pricing and claims data managed by health plans and other third parties, or changes to the fees we pay for that data; 
                
    the timing and success of introductions of new products, services and pricing by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners; 
                
    our ability to attract new customers; 
                
    customer renewal rates and the timing and terms of customer renewals; 
                
    network outages or security breaches; 
                
    the mix of products and services sold or renewed during a period;  
                
    general economic, industry and market conditions;  
                
    the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future   charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; and 
                
    impact of new accounting pronouncements. 
     We are particularly subject to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations since the costs associated with entering into customer agreements and implementing our offerings are generally incurred prior to launch, while we generally recognize revenue over the term of the agreement beginning at launch. In addition, some of our contracts with customers provide for one-time bonus payments if our offering achieves certain metrics, such as a certain rate of employee engagement, which may lead to additional fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. In certain contracts, employee engagement may refer to the number of first time registrations by employees of our customers and in other cases it may refer to return usage of our products by employees. Any fluctuations in our quarterly results may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our Class B common stock. 
  If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase and we may be unable to implement our business strategy. 
  We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, which puts strain on our business, operations and employees. For example, our revenue has increased from   $54.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $71.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   To manage our current and anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our IT infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls.   Moreover, we may from time to time decide to undertake cost savings initiatives, such as the reduction in workforce we implemented in 2016, or disposing of,  
  
    26 

     Table of Contents  

or otherwise discontinuing certain products, in an effort to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business.   We must also attract, train and retain a significant number of qualified personnel in key areas such as, sales and marketing, customer support, professional services, engineering and management, and the availability of such personnel, in particular software engineers, may be constrained. These and similar challenges, and the related costs, may be exacerbated by the fact that our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
  A key aspect to managing our growth is our ability to scale our capabilities to implement our offering satisfactorily with respect to both large and demanding enterprise customers, who currently comprise the substantial majority of our customer base, as well as smaller customers. Large customers often require specific features or functions unique to their particular business processes, which at a time of rapid growth or during periods of high demand, may strain our implementation capacity and hinder our ability to successfully implement our offering to our customers in a timely manner. We may also need to make further investments in our technology and automate portions of our offering or services to decrease our costs, particularly as we grow sales of our health benefits platform to smaller customers. If we are unable to address the needs of our customers or their employees, or our customers or their employees are unsatisfied with the quality of our offering or services, they may not renew their agreements, seek to cancel or terminate their relationship with us or renew on less favorable terms.   In addition, many of our customers adjust their benefit plan designs, benefits providers and eligibility criteria at the start of each new benefits plan year, requiring additional configurations for those customers. As our customer base grows, the complexity of these activities can increase. If we fail to automate these operations sufficiently and implement these changes on a timely basis or are unable to implement them effectively, our business may suffer. 
  Failure to effectively manage our growth could also lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, financial losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. Our growth is expected to require significant capital expenditures and might divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. In addition, data and content fees, which are one of our primary operational costs, are not fixed as they vary based on the source and condition of the data we receive from third parties, and if they remain variable or increase over time, we would not be able to realize the economies of scale that we expect as we grow renewals and implementation of new customers, which would negatively impact our gross margin. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses might increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase or might grow more slowly than expected and we might be unable to implement our business strategy. The quality of our offering might also suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers. 
  We incur significant upfront costs in our customer relationships, and if we are unable to maintain and grow these customer relationships over time, we are likely to fail to recover these costs and our operating results will suffer. 
  We devote significant resources and incur significant upfront costs to establish relationships with our customers and implement our offering and related services, particularly in the case of large enterprises that, often request or require specific features or functions unique to their particular business processes. Accordingly, our operating results will depend in substantial part on our ability to deliver a successful customer experience and persuade our customers to maintain and grow their relationship with us over time. For example, if we are not successful in implementing our offering or delivering a successful customer experience, a customer could terminate or fail to renew their agreement with us, we would lose or be unable to recoup the significant upfront costs that we had expended on such customer and our operating results would suffer. As we grow, our customer acquisition costs could outpace our build-up of recurring revenue, and we may be unable to reduce our total operating costs through economies of scale such that we are unable to achieve profitability. 
  Our ability to deliver our full offering to customers depends in substantial part on our ability to access pricing and claims data managed by a limited number of health plans and other third parties. 
  In order to deliver the full functionality offered by our health benefits platform, we need continued access, on behalf of our customers, to sources of pricing and claims data, much of which is managed by a limited number of health plans and other third parties. We have developed various long-term and short-term processes to obtain data from certain health plans and other third parties. We are limited in our ability to offer the full functionality of our offering to customers of health plans with whom we do not have a data-sharing or joint customer support process or arrangement. 
  The terms of the arrangements under which we have access to data managed by health plans and other third parties vary, which can impact the offering we are able to deliver. Many of our arrangements with health plans and third parties have terms  
  
    27 

     Table of Contents  

that limit our access to and permitted uses of claims or pricing data to the data associated with our mutual customers. Also, some agreements, processes, or arrangements may be terminated if the underlying customer contracts do not continue, or may otherwise be subject to termination or non-renewal in whole or in part.  
  The health plans and other third parties that we currently work with may, in the future, change their position and limit or eliminate our access to pricing and claims data, increase the costs for access to data, provide data to us in more limited or less useful formats, or restrict our permitted uses of data. Furthermore, some health plans have developed or are developing their own proprietary price and quality estimation tools and may perceive continued cooperation with us as a competitive disadvantage and choose to limit or discontinue our access to pricing and claims data. Failure to continue to maintain and expand our access to pricing and claims data may adversely impact our ability to continue to serve existing customers and expand our offering to new customers. 
  If our access to pricing and claims data is reduced or becomes more costly to us, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer. 
  We are investing in and expect to increasingly rely on channel partners for a portion of our sales, and if our channel partner relationships are unsuccessful then our sales results will be adversely affected and the growth of our business will be harmed.    
    
    Our sales strategy relies in part on relationships we have developed with health plans, benefits consultants, brokers and other industry participants, and we are continuing to invest in, and expect to increase our reliance on, these relationships with channel partners to access additional customer segments and grow our overall sales. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify suitable channel partners and, if we identify such channel partners, there can be no assurance that our channel partner relationships will be successful, or will result in access to additional customers or growth in sales. Our channel partnerships could fail for a variety of reasons, including changes in our partners  business priorities, insufficient or misaligned incentives for our partners  to assist us with sales, competition, or other factors.   
    
  In addition, our reliance on sales through channel partners could put downward pressure on the total revenue we are able to generate, and could result in existing customers electing to use alternative or lower-functionality versions of our products that we may elect to provide through channel partners. The concentration of a material portion of business with any given channel partner could also create tensions with other companies we do business with, including health plans on whom we rely to receive data and offer our services.  
    
  Certain relationships we will enter or have entered into with channel partners will require substantial investments of our resources to support these initiatives.  There can be no assurance that the investments we make to develop and support these channel relationships, or the effort required to do so, will provide a positive return on our investment in the near term, or at all.  If any of these events materialize, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
  If our existing customers do not continue or renew their agreements with us, renew at lower fee levels or decline to purchase additional products and services from us, our business and operating results will suffer. 
  We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of existing customer agreements and sales of additional products and services to existing customers.   Revenue recognized in any quarter is largely derived from customer agreements signed in prior quarters.   As a result, achieving a high renewal rate of our customer agreements and selling additional products and services is critical to our future operating results. 
  However, we have a limited operating history and do not yet have enough experience with customer renewals to predict our customer renewal rate. We may experience significantly more difficulty than we anticipate in renewing existing customer agreements or in renewing them upon favorable terms. Factors that may affect the renewal rate for our offering, terms of those renewals and our ability to sell additional products and services include: 
             
    the price, performance and functionality of our offering; 
                
    our customers  user counts and benefit design features; 
                
    the availability, price, performance and functionality of competing or alternative solutions; 
     
    28 

     Table of Contents  

the potential for customers that are able to access lower-functionality versions of our offering that we provide through health plans or other channel partners to opt to use the lower-functionality versions of our offering; 
                
    our ability to develop complementary products and services; 
                
    our continued ability to access the pricing and claims data necessary to enable us to deliver reliable data in our cost estimation and price transparency offering to customers; 
                
    the stability, performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services; 
                
    changes in health care laws, regulations or trends; and 
                
    the business environment of our customers, in particular, headcount reductions by our customers.    
       
  We enter into master services agreements with our customers. These agreements generally have stated terms of three years. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our offering after the term expires. In addition, our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal, which may reduce our revenue from these customers. Factors that are not within our control may contribute to a reduction in our contract revenue. For instance, our customers may reduce their number of employees, which would result in a corresponding reduction in the number of employee users eligible for our offering and thus a lower aggregate monthly services fee. Our future operating results also depend, in part, on our ability to sell new products and services to our existing customers. If our customers fail to renew their agreements, renew their agreements upon less favorable terms or at lower fee levels, or fail to purchase new products and services from us, our revenue may decline or our future revenue may be constrained. 
  In addition, a significant number of our customer agreements allow customers to terminate such agreements for convenience at certain times, typically with one to three months advance notice. We typically incur the expenses associated with integrating a customer s data into our health care database and related training and support prior to recognizing meaningful revenue from such customer. Customer subscription revenue is not recognized until our products are implemented for launch, which is generally from three to twelve months from contract signing. If a customer terminates its agreement early and revenue and cash flows expected from a customer are not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
  A significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of customers, the loss of which would adversely affect our financial results. 
  Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top 10 customers by revenue accounted for 35% of our total revenue and no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. We rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to promote our offering to potential customers. The loss of any of our key customers, or a failure of some of them to renew or expand user subscriptions, could have a significant impact on the growth rate of our revenue, reputation and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers could lead to cancellation or non-renewal of our agreements with those customers or by the acquiring or combining companies, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers. 
  Because we generally bill our customers and recognize revenue over the term of the contract, near term declines in new or renewed agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results and may be difficult to discern. 
  Most of our revenue in each quarter is derived from agreements entered into with our customers during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed agreements in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenue in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales of and market demand for our offering, and potential changes in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.   Accordingly, management measures sales performance and forecasts future subscription revenue based on signed annual recurring revenue, or ARR. ARR is a forward-looking metric based on contractual terms in existence as of the end of a reporting period and is subject to change resulting from a number of factors including, but not limited to, addition of new customers, changes in user counts, terminations or non-renewals, as well as upsells and cross-sells. For all of these reasons, the amount of subscription revenue we actually recognize may be different from ARR at the end of a period in which it was recorded.   In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure rapidly, or at all, to take account of reduced revenue. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total  
  
    29 

     Table of Contents  

revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the agreement. Accordingly, the effect of changes in the industry impacting our business or changes we experience in our new sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations. 
    
  Our sales and implementation cycle can be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. 
  The sales cycle for our health benefits platform, from initial contact with a potential lead to contract execution and implementation, varies widely by customer, ranging from three to 24 months. Some of our customers undertake a significant and prolonged evaluation process, including whether our offering meets a customer s unique benefits program needs, that frequently involves not only the review of our offering but also of our competitors, which has in the past resulted in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our offering. Moreover, our large enterprise customers often begin to deploy our service on a limited basis, but nevertheless demand extensive configuration, integration services and pricing concessions, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our offering widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial upfront investment. It is possible that in the future we may experience even longer sales cycles, more complex customer needs, higher upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales as we continue to expand our direct sales force and thereby increase the percentage of our sales personnel with less experience in selling our service, expand into new territories and add additional products and services.   In addition, even after contracts are signed, our implementation timelines can delay recognition of related revenue for several periods.   If our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront sales and implementation investments do not result in sufficient sales or revenue to justify our investments, our operating results may be harmed. 
  The health care industry is heavily regulated. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and otherwise negatively affect our business. 
  The health care industry is heavily regulated and is constantly evolving due to the changing political, legislative and regulatory landscape and other factors. Many health care laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear. Further, some health care laws differ from state to state and it is difficult to ensure our business complies with evolving laws in all states. Our operations may be adversely affected by enforcement initiatives. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business, or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. For example, failure to comply with these requirements could result in the unwillingness of current and potential customers to work with us. Federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider proposals to revise aspects of the legal rules applicable to the health care industry, or to revise or create additional statutory and regulatory requirements. Such proposals, if implemented, could impact our operations, the use of our offering and our ability to market new products and services, or could create unexpected liabilities for us. We cannot predict what changes to laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or our operating costs. 
  If we fail to comply with applicable health information privacy and security laws and other state and federal privacy and security laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities, reputational harm and other negative consequences, including decreasing the willingness of current and potential customers to work with us. 
  We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business;   these regulations address matters central to our business, including privacy and data protection, personal information, content, data security, data retention and deletion, and user communications. The introduction of new products or expansion of our activities may subject us to additional laws and regulations. In particular, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, collectively HIPAA, which   established uniform federal standards for certain  covered entities,  which include health care providers and health plans, governing the conduct of specified electronic health care transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information, or PHI. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010, makes HIPAA s privacy and security standards directly applicable to  business associates,  which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file  
  
    30 

     Table of Contents  

civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA s requirements and seek attorney s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
  A portion of the data that we obtain and handle for or on behalf of our customers is considered PHI, subject to HIPAA. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our HIPAA covered entity health plan customers, we are considered a  business associate  to those customers, and are required to maintain the privacy and security of PHI in accordance with HIPAA and the terms of our business associate agreements with customers, including by implementing HIPAA-required administrative, technical and physical safeguards. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs to establish and maintain these safeguards and, if additional safeguards are required to comply with HIPAA regulations or our customers  requirements, our costs could increase further, which would negatively affect our operating results. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain adequate safeguards, or we or our agents and subcontractors use or disclose PHI in a manner prohibited or not permitted by HIPAA or our business associate agreements with our customers, or if the privacy or security of PHI that we obtain and handle is otherwise compromised, we could be subject to significant liabilities and consequences, including, without limitation: 
             
    breach of our contractual obligations to customers, which may cause our customers to terminate their relationship with us and may result in potentially significant financial obligations to our customers; 
                
    investigation by the federal and state regulatory authorities empowered to enforce HIPAA, which include the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state attorneys general, and the possible imposition of civil penalties; 
                
    private litigation by individuals adversely affected by any violation of HIPAA, HITECH or comparable state laws for which we are responsible; and 
                
    negative publicity, which may decrease the willingness of current and potential future customers to work with us and negatively affect our sales and operating results. 
     Further, we publish statements to end users of our services that describe how we handle and protect personal information. If federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants consider any portion of these statements to be untrue, we may be subject to claims of deceptive practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including, without limitation, costs of responding to investigations, defending against litigation, settling claims and complying with regulatory or court orders. 
  We also send SMS text messages to potential end users who are eligible to use our service through certain customers and partners. While we get consent from or on behalf of these individuals to send text messages, federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures we provide, form of consents we obtain or our SMS texting practices are not adequate. These SMS texting campaigns are potential sources of risk for class action lawsuits and liability for our company. Numerous class-action suits under federal and state laws have been filed in recent years against companies who conduct SMS texting programs. Many of those suits have resulted in multi-million dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. 
  If our new products and services are not adopted by our customers, or if we fail to continue to innovate and develop new products and services that are adopted by customers, then our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected. 
  To date we have derived a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our core Castlight platform, and our longer-term operating results and continued growth depend in part on our ability to successfully develop and sell new products and services that our new and existing customers want and are willing to purchase. In addition to our core Castlight platform, we have introduced a number of product cross-sells, such as our Castlight Pharmacy, Castlight Dental, Castlight Action, Castlight Elevate, Castlight Protect, and Castlight Rewards, but it is uncertain whether these products and services will result in significant revenue or comprise a significant portion of our total revenue. In addition, we have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources in research and development to enhance our existing offering and introduce new high quality products and services. If existing customers are not willing to make additional payments for such new products, or if new customers do not value such new products, our business and operating results will be harmed. If we are unable to predict user preferences or our industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our offering and services on a timely basis, we might lose customers. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers, appropriately timed with market opportunity or effectively communicated and brought to market.

We operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. 
  The market for our products and services is competitive, and we expect it to attract increased competition, which could make it hard for us to succeed. We currently face competition for sub-components of our offering from a range of companies, including specialized software and solution providers that offer similar solutions, often at substantially lower prices, and that are continuing to develop additional products and becoming more sophisticated and effective. These competitors include but are not limited to   Change Healthcare Corporation, ClearCost Health, Healthcare Bluebook, HealthSparq and Truven Health Analytics Inc.   In addition, large, well-financed health plans, with whom we cooperate and on whom we depend in order to obtain the pricing and claims data we need to deliver our offering to customers, have in some cases developed their own cost and quality estimation tools and provide these solutions to their customers at discounted prices or often for free. These health plans include, for example,   Aetna Inc., Anthem, Cigna Corporation, and UnitedHealth Group, Inc.   Competition from specialized software and solution providers, health plans and other parties may result in pricing pressure, which may lead to price decline in certain product segments, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability and market share. In addition, if health plans perceive continued cooperation with us as a threat to their business interests, they may take steps that impair our access to pricing and claims data, or that otherwise make it more difficult or costly for us to deliver our offering to customers. 
  Some of our competitors, in particular health plans, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and significantly greater resources than we do. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result, our competitors might be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and might in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances might emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our competitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of our market, such as customers that desire a more narrow solution, which could create additional price pressure. In light of these factors, even if our offering is more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitive offerings in lieu of purchasing our offerings. 
    
  Shifts in health care benefits trends, including any potential decline in the number of self-insured employers, or the emergence of new technologies may render our offering obsolete or require us to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. 
  The U.S. health care industry is massive, with a number of large market participants with conflicting agendas, is subject to significant government regulation and is currently undergoing significant change. Changes in our industry, for example, towards private health care exchanges or away from high deductible health plans, or the emergence of new technologies as more competitors enter our market, could result in our offering being less desirable or relevant. 
  For example, we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from sales to customers that are self-insured employers. The demand for our offering depends on the need of self-insured employers to manage the costs of health care services that they pay on behalf of their employees. While the percentage of employers who are self-insured has been increasing over the past decade, there is no assurance that this trend will continue. Various factors, including changes in the health care insurance market or in government regulation of the health care industry, could cause the percentage of self-insured employers to decline, which would adversely affect the market for our offering and would negatively affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, such trends and our business could be affected by changes in health care spending resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which was enacted in March 2010 and is currently being implemented. For example, under the ACA the federal government and several state governments established public exchanges in which consumers can purchase health insurance. In the event that the implementation of the ACA causes our customers to change their health care benefits plans or move to use of exchanges such that it reduces the need for our offering, or if the number of self-insured employers otherwise declines, we would be forced to compete on additional product and service attributes or to expend significant resources in order to alter our offering to remain competitive. 
  If health care benefits trends shift or entirely new technologies are developed that replace existing offerings, our existing or future offerings could be rendered obsolete and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new products and enhancements.

We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
  Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth, respond to business challenges or opportunities, develop new products and services, enhance our existing offering and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our net cash used in operating activities was   $35.3 million   and   $44.9 million  , respectively. Our future capital requirements may be significantly different from our current estimates and will depend on many factors including our growth rate, new customer acquisitions, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our cloud-based subscription services. Accordingly, we might need to engage in equity or debt financings or collaborative arrangements to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class B common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or offering that we otherwise would not relinquish. In addition, during the recent economic instability, it has been difficult for many companies to obtain financing in the public markets or to obtain debt financing, and we might not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 
  Our proprietary software may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results. 
  Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we will discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary products from operating properly. In addition to our core Castlight platform, we are currently implementing software with respect to a number of new products and services, including our Castlight Pharmacy, Castlight Dental, Castlight Action, Castlight Elevate, Castlight Protect and Castlight Rewards. If our offering does not function reliably or fails to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients which would adversely affect our operating results. 
  Moreover, data services that are as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors. Material performance problems, defects or errors in our existing or new software and products and services may arise in the future and may result from interface of our offering with systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control or undetected in our testing. These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Defects or errors in our health benefits platform might discourage existing or potential customers from purchasing our offering from us. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. 
  If we cannot implement our offering for customers in a timely manner, we may lose customers and our reputation may be harmed. 
  Our customers have a variety of different data formats, enterprise applications and infrastructure and our offering must support our customers  data formats and integrate with complex enterprise applications and infrastructures. If our platform does not currently support a customer s required data format or appropriately integrate with a customer s applications and infrastructure, or if an existing customer switches to unsupported infrastructure, then we must configure our platform to do so, which increases our expenses. Additionally, we do not control our customers  implementation schedules. As a result, if our customers do not allocate internal resources necessary to meet their implementation responsibilities or if we face unanticipated implementation difficulties, the implementation may be delayed. Further, our implementation capacity has at times constrained our ability to successfully implement our offering for our customers in a timely manner, particularly during periods of high  
  
    33 

     Table of Contents  

demand. If the customer implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed, we could incur significant costs, customers could become dissatisfied and decide not to increase usage of our offering, or not to use our offering beyond an initial period prior to their term commitment or, in some cases, revenue recognition could be delayed.   Our data dependencies and implementation procedures differ for each new product that we launch. Accordingly, our ability to convert sales of new products into billings and revenue depends on our ability to create a scalable launch infrastructure in each case.   In addition, competitors with more efficient operating models with lower implementation costs could penetrate our customer relationships. 
  Additionally, large and demanding enterprise customers, who currently comprise the majority of our customer base, may request or require specific features or functions unique to their particular business processes, which increase our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts and the revenue resulting from the customers under our typical contract length may not cover the upfront investments. If prospective large customers require specific features or functions that we do not offer, then the market for our offering will be more limited and our business could suffer. 
  In addition, supporting large customers could require us to devote significant development services and support personnel and strain our personnel resources and infrastructure. Furthermore, if we are unable to address the needs of these customers in a timely fashion or further develop and enhance our offering, or if a customer or its employees are not satisfied with our quality of work, our offering or professional services then we could incur additional costs to address the situation. In addition, we may be required to issue credits or refunds for pre-paid amounts related to unused services, the timing of recognition of revenue for, and the profitability of, that work might be impaired and the customer s dissatisfaction with our offering could damage our ability to expand the number of products and services purchased by that customer. These customers may not renew their agreements, seek to terminate their relationship with us or renew on less favorable terms. Moreover, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to retain or compete for new business with current and prospective customers. If any of these were to occur, our revenue may fail to grow at historical rates or at all, or may even decline, and our operating results could be adversely affected. 
  Any failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and harm our financial results. 
  Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve any technical issues relating to our offering. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the quality of our offering, our business reputation and on strong recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly-responsive technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our offering to existing and prospective customers, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
  We offer technical support services with our offering and may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services, particularly as we increase the size of our customer base. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. It is difficult to predict customer demand for technical support services and if customer demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our customers and their employees. Additionally, increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. 
  We depend on data centers operated by third parties for our offering, and any disruption in the operation of these facilities could adversely affect our business. 
  We provide our health benefits platform through computer hardware that is currently located in two third-party data centers in Colorado and Arizona, each of which are operated by the same IT hosting company. While we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in these external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. The owner of our data centers has no obligation to renew the agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these types of agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if our data center operator is acquired or ceases operations, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. 
  
    34 

     Table of Contents  

Problems faced by our third-party data center locations could adversely affect the experience of our customers. The operator of the data centers could decide to close the facilities without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by the operator of the data centers or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Additionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, this could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, a rapid expansion of our business could affect the service levels at our data centers or cause such data centers and systems to fail. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any disruptions or other performance problems with our product offering could adversely affect our reputation and may damage our customers  stored files or result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, increase our costs associated with remediation or cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscriptions, subject us to potential liability or adversely affect our renewal rates. 
  The information that we provide to our customers, and their employees and families, could be inaccurate or incomplete, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We provide price, quality and other health care-related information for use by our customers, and their employees and families, to search and compare options for health care services. Third-party health plans and our customers provide us with most of these data. Because data in the health care industry is fragmented in origin, inconsistent in format and often incomplete, the overall quality of data in the health care industry is poor, and we frequently discover data issues and errors. If the data that we provide to our customers are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, our reputation may suffer and our ability to attract and retain customers may be harmed. 
  In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of health care services or erroneous health information. While we maintain insurance coverage, this coverage may prove to be inadequate or could cease to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs, harm to our reputation and diversion of management resources. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees   or key subcontractor services   could adversely affect our business. 
  Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. These executive officers are at-will employees and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. We do not maintain  key person  insurance for any of these executive officers or any of our other key employees. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. 
  To continue to execute our growth strategy, we also must attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition is intense for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are located. We might not be successful in maintaining our unique culture and continuing to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel with appropriate qualifications. The pool of qualified personnel with Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, experience or experience working with the health care market is limited overall. In addition, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.   We supplement our hired skilled personnel through the use of subcontractors, particularly in the area of research and development, a significant portion of which perform services outside of the United States.  If these subcontractors cease to perform services for us for any reason, our ability to meet our development goals may be impaired, and our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.  
  In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity instruments they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility or performance trends in the price of our stock might, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options and other equity instruments might  
  
    35

discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option or equity awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 
  If we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the elements of our culture that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. 
  We believe that a critical asset for our business, and a source of our competitive strength, is our unique company culture, which we believe fosters a high level of cross-functional collaboration and desire for excellence in our performance and product. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain personnel, our reputation and our ability to continue to build and advance our offering and may otherwise adversely affect our future success. 
  If we fail to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, our business may suffer. 
  We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our offering and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our offering. 
  Our marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing customers. 
  Our marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current customers to provide positive references to new, potential customers. Given our limited number of long-term customers, the loss or dissatisfaction of any customer could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market adoption of our offering and impair our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. 
  Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our employees, consultants and contractors to enter into confidentiality, noncompetition and assignment of inventions agreements. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. While we have two U.S. patent applications pending, and we currently have one issued U.S. patent, we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted or that our issued patent will adequately protect our intellectual property. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market solutions similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business. Further, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our offering, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and may not be effective. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business. 
  We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party s intellectual property rights. 
  In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the Internet and technology industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and our competitors and other third parties may hold patents or have pending patent applications, which could be related to our business. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, which we refer to as non-practicing entities, whose sole primary business is to assert such claims. We expect that  
  
    36 

     Table of Contents  

we may receive in the future notices that claim we or our customers using our offering have misappropriated or misused other parties  intellectual property rights, particularly as the number of competitors in our market grows and the functionality of products amongst competitors overlaps. If we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights, the litigation, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert our management s time, attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business. We do not currently have an extensive patent portfolio of our own, which may limit the defenses available to us in any such litigation. 
  In addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that our offering infringes the intellectual property rights of such third parties. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our customers as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification,   may require us to do one or more of the following: 
             
    cease offering or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
                
    make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages; 
                
    obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or 
                
    incur substantial costs and reallocate resources to redesign our technology to avoid infringement. 
     If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results. 
  Our use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our software platform. 
  Our offering incorporates open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of these licenses and therefore the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown. There is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our software platform. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our offering, discontinue sales of our offering in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could cause us to breach customer contracts, harm our reputation, result in customer losses or claims, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results. 
    
  We may face risks related to securities litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards. 
  We are currently and may in the future become subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. For example, in April and May, 2015, a series of purported securities class action lawsuits was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, against us, certain of our current and former directors, executive officers, significant stockholders, and underwriters associated with our IPO. These lawsuits were brought by purported stockholders of our company seeking to represent a class consisting of all those who purchased our stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with our IPO. The lawsuits, which were consolidated on July 22, 2015, seek unspecified damages. We are generally obliged, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits. On March 28, 2016, the parties to the consolidated actions reached a mutually acceptable resolution by way of a mediated cash settlement. The aggregate amount of the settlement under the agreement in principle is $9.5 million. The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 13, 2016, and the Court granted final approval of the settlement on October 28, 2016. As a result of the settlement the Company recorded a net charge of $2.9 million to general and administrative expense in 2016, which was paid out by the Company in the third quarter of 2016. This amount represents the charge for this matter that was not covered by insurance. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the litigation, the Company is satisfied with this resolution given the risks and expenses associated with further litigation. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and when we can reasonably 
  
    37 

     Table of Contents  

estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. Regardless of the final outcome, this or future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. 
  We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products and services or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our offering, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. 
  In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including: 
             
    inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; 
                
    unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; 
                
    difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business; 
                
    difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business; 
                
    difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company; 
                
    diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; 
                
    adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition; 
                
    the potential loss of key employees; 
                
    use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and 
                
    use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition. 
       
  In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial position may suffer. 
  If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class B common stock may be negatively affected.  
  As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2015, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an  emerging growth company , as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at  
  
    38 

     Table of Contents  

which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which process will be time consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm concludes we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Class B common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to obtain additional financial and management resources. 
  We incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company. 
  As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, changes in corporate governance practices and required filing of annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Compliance with these requirements increases our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act.  
  Operating as a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. This could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. 
  We are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our Class B common stock less attractive to investors. 
  We are an emerging growth company, as defined under the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class B common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class B common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class B common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 
  We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the year in which the market value of our Class B common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30, (ii) the end of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) December 31, 2019. 
  We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability. 
  Our primary tax jurisdiction is the United States. All of our tax years are open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities due to our history of tax losses. We have provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such assets. Therefore, no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. The net operating loss could expire unused and be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.

Economic uncertainties or downturns in the general economy or the industries in which our customers operate could disproportionately affect the demand for our offering and negatively impact our results of operations. 
  General worldwide economic conditions have experienced a significant downturn, and market volatility and uncertainty remain w  idespread, making it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, in June 2016, the decision by referendum to withdraw the United Kingdom (U.K.) from the European Union caused significant volatility in global stock markets, including those in the U.S., and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The results of this referendum, or other global events, may continue to create global economic uncertainty not only in the U.K., but in other regions, including where we do business. In   addition, these conditions could cause our customers or prospective customers to decrease headcount, benefits or human resources budgets, which could decrease corporate spending on our products and services, resulting in delayed and lengthened sales cycles, a decrease in new customer acquisition and loss of customers. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our customers may have difficulty gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. If that were to occur, our financial results could be harmed. Further, challenging economic conditions might impair the ability of our customers to pay for the products and services they already have purchased from us and, as a result, our write-offs of accounts receivable could increase. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery. If the condition of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsens, our business could be harmed. 
  Our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. 
  Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of the market for our products and services may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.  
  Natural or man-made disasters and other similar events may significantly disrupt our business and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our offices may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, fires, floods, nuclear disasters and acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our business for some period of time. For example, our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Any disruptions in our operations related to the repair or replacement of our office could negatively impact our business and results of operations and harm our reputation. In addition, we may not carry business insurance sufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Any such losses or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the facilities of significant customers, health plans or major strategic partners may be harmed or rendered inoperable by such natural or man-made disasters, which may cause disruptions, difficulties or material adverse effects on our business. 
  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class B Common Stock 
  The stock price of our Class B common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. 
  The market price of our Class B common stock has fluctuated significantly since our public offering and may continue to fluctuate. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class B common stock. Factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause additional fluctuations in the market price of our Class B common stock include the following: 
             
    overall performance of the equity markets; 
                
    our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies; 
                
    changes in the estimates of our operating results that we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections; 
                
    failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our Class B common stock; 
     
    40 

     Table of Contents  

sales of shares of our Class B common stock by us or our stockholders; 
                
    announcements of technological innovations, new products or enhancements to services, acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; 
                
    disruptions in our services due to computer hardware, software or network problems; 
                
    announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; 
                
    recruitment or departure of key personnel; 
                
    the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; 
                
    litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; 
                
    developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; 
                
    new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; and 
                
    the size of our market float. 
     In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in new securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. 
  If there are substantial sales of shares of our Class B common stock, the price of our Class B common stock could decline. 
  The price of our Class B common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our Class B common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares, and may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell Class B common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate.  We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class B common stock.   
  In addition, certain of our stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares and to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. Registration of the resale of these shares under the Securities Act would generally result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction. Any sales of securities by existing stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We also registered shares of Class B common stock that we have issued and may issue under our employee equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. These shares may be sold freely in the public market upon issuance. 
  The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers (including our Chief Executive Officer) and directors and their affiliates; this will limit or preclude a stockholder s ability to influence corporate matters. 
  Each share of Class A common stock and each share of Class B common stock has one vote per share, except on the following matters (in which each share of Class A common stock has ten votes per share and each share of Class B common stock has one vote per share): 
             
    adoption of a merger or consolidation agreement involving our company; 
                
    a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of our property and assets; 
                
    a dissolution or liquidation of our company; or 
                
    every matter, if and when any individual, entity or  group  (as such term is used in Regulation 13D of the Exchange Act) has, or has publicly disclosed (through a press release or a filing with the SEC) an intent to have, beneficial  
     
    41 

     Table of Contents  

ownership of 30% or more of the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, combined.    
  Because of our dual class common stock structure, the holders of our Class A common stock, who consist of our founders, directors, executives, employees, will continue to be able to control the corporate matters listed above if any such matter is submitted to our stockholders for approval even if they come to own less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   o  ur executive officers and directors and their affiliates own 32.4% of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B Common Stock, combined. However, because of our dual class common stock structure our executive officers and directors and their affiliates have 56.7% of the total votes in each of the matters identified in the list above.   This concentrated control by our Class A common stockholders will limit or preclude the ability of a holder of our Class B common stock to influence those corporate matters for the foreseeable future and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. The market price of our Class B common stock could be adversely affected by the structure. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that a stockholder may feel are in its best interests. 
  Transfers by holders of Class A common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class B common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class A common stock to Class B common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class A common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, our executive officers (including our Chief Executive Officer), directors and their affiliates retain a significant portion of their holdings of Class A common stock for an extended period of time, they could continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock with respect to each of the matters identified in the list above. 
  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
  The trading market for our Class B common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class B common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class B common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class B common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class B common stock price and trading volume to decline. 
  We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
  We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class B common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. 
  Anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management and depress the trading price of our Class B common stock. 
  Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.  
  In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company or changes in our board of directors or management more difficult, including the following: 

our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause, which may delay the replacement of a majority of our board of directors or impede an acquirer from rapidly replacing our existing directors with its own slate of directors; 
                
    subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, only our board of directors has the right to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the  
     
    42 

     Table of Contents  

resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; 
             
    our stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders  meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock are not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders  meetings or special stockholders  meetings, which special meetings may only be called by the chairman of our board, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors; 
                
    certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware; 
                
    our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, by our board of directors without the approval of the holders of Class B common stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us; 
                
    advance notice procedures and additional disclosure requirements apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;

Exhibit 

First Amendment to Office Lease 
    
  This First Amendment to Office Lease (the "  Amendment  ") is made and entered into as of September 26, 2016 ("  Amendment Date  "), by and between 150 SPEAR STREET, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("  Landlord  "), and CASTLIGHT HEALTH, INC., a Delaware corporation ("  Tenant  "), with reference to the following facts. 
  Recitals 
  A.    Landlord and Tenant have entered into that certain Office Lease dated as of May 7, 2015 (the "  Lease  "), for the leasing of certain premises consisting of approximately 36,333 rentable square feet located at 150 Spear Street, Suites 200, 400, 500 and 575, San Francisco, California (the "  Original Premises  ") as such Original Premises are more fully described in the Lease. 
  B.    Landlord and Tenant now wish to amend the Lease to provide for, among other things, (i) the extension of the Term of the Lease, (ii) the reduction in the size of the Original Premises by approximately 7,313 rentable square feet (the "  Reduction Premises  "), which Reduction Premises are commonly known as Suites 500 and 575 shown on   Exhibit A   attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, and (iii) the addition to the Original Premises of approximately 15,560 rentable square feet of space located in Suite 1400 (the "  Additional Premises  "), all upon and subject to each of the terms, conditions, and provisions set forth herein. 
  NOW, THEREFORE  , in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows: 
  1.      Recitals:   Landlord and Tenant agree that the above recitals are true and correct and are hereby incorporated herein as though set forth in full. 
  2.      Term:   The Term of the Lease, which is currently scheduled to expire on June 30, 2021 (the    Lease Expiration Date   ), is hereby extended until June 30, 2022 (the    Revised Expiration Date   ), unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of the Lease. The twelve (12)-month period from and after the Lease Expiration Date through the Revised Expiration Date shall hereinafter be referred to as the  Extended Term . 
  3.      Termination of Reduction Premises:   Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge and agree that the Lease with respect to the Reduction Premises shall terminate and be of no further force and effect as of 12:00 a.m. on the date that this Amendment is mutually executed and delivered (the "  RP Termination Date  "). Effective as of the RP Termination Date, the definition of the "Original Premises" shall be modified so that the Reduction Premises shall no longer be included within such definition and from and after the RP Termination Date, the Original Premises shall consist of approximately 29,020 square feet of rentable area, but subject to expansion as provided in Section 5 below. Notwithstanding such termination of the Lease with respect to the Reduction Premises or surrender of the Reduction Premises pursuant to   Section 4   below, any and all obligations of Landlord and Tenant under the Lease, as amended hereby, with respect to the Reduction Premises which are to survive any termination or surrender thereof shall continue to survive such termination and surrender. 
  4.      Surrender of the Reduction Premises:   Landlord acknowledges that on the RP Termination Date, Tenant vacated and surrendered to Landlord exclusive possession of the Reduction Premises in its "AS-IS" condition. 
  5.      Premises: 
  5.1      Commencing on the earlier to occur of (i) the date Tenant commences operation of its business from any portion of the Additional Premises, or (ii) July 16, 2017 (the    AP Commencement Date   ), there shall be added to the Original Premises the Additional Premises, which Additional Premises are depicted on the site plan attached hereto and made a part hereof as   Exhibit A-1.

5.2      For purposes of the Lease, from and after the AP Commencement Date, the "  Premises  " as defined in the Lease shall mean and refer to the aggregate of the Original Premises (less the Reduction Premises) and the Additional Premises consisting of a combined total of approximately 44,580 rentable square feet located at 150 Spear Street, Suites 200, 400 and 1400, San Francisco, California. Accordingly, from and after the AP Commencement Date, all references in this Amendment and in the Lease to the term "Premises" shall mean and refer to the Original Premises (less the Reduction Premises) and the Additional Premises. Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that for purposes of the Lease, from and after the AP Commencement Date, the rentable square footage area of the Premises shall be conclusively deemed to be 44,580 rentable square feet. In addition to the foregoing, it is the parties express intention that the balance of the Lease Term for the Original Premises (less the Reduction Premises) and the Additional Premises be coterminous with the Revised Expiration Date of the Extended Term as specified in Section 2 above and that the option to extend the term described in Section 2.2 of the Lease shall be applicable to both the Original Premises (less the Reduction Premises) and the Additional Premises. Tenant shall have the right to install identification signage anywhere in the Additional Premises, including in the elevator lobby of the Additional Premises, subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease. 
  5.3      Subject to Section 5.4 below, Landlord shall permit Tenant to access and enter the Additional Premises on June 1, 2017 (the "  Early Entry Date  "), for purposes of installing the Tenant Improvements (as defined in   Exhibit B   attached hereto). Such entry and use of the Additional Premises by Tenant shall be at Tenant's sole risk and shall also be subject to all of the provisions of the Lease including, but not limited to, the requirement to obtain the insurance required pursuant to the Lease and to deliver insurance certificates as required herein. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant shall not be required to pay Rent (including any utilities costs incurred) for the Additional Premises prior to the AP Commencement Date. In addition to the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right to impose such additional reasonable conditions on Tenant's early entry as Landlord shall deem reasonably appropriate. 
  5.4      Tenant hereby acknowledges that the Additional Premises are presently being occupied by SendMe, Inc. and OneLogin (the "  Existing Tenants  "). Landlord's delivery to Tenant of possession of the Additional Premises by the Early Entry Date is contingent upon the Existing Tenants vacating the Additional Premises and surrendering possession thereof to Landlord by May 31, 2017. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that if Landlord cannot deliver to Tenant possession of the Additional Premises on the Early Entry Date, except as expressly provided in Section 5.5 below, Landlord shall neither be subject to any liability nor shall the validity of the Lease or this Amendment be affected. 
  5.5      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5, if for any reason Landlord fails to deliver possession of the Additional Premises by the Early Entry Date, the AP Commencement Date shall be extended by one (1) day for each day between the Early Entry Date and the date that possession of the Additional Premises is actually delivered to Tenant. 
  6.      Base Rent:   Effective as of the RP Termination Date, Section 4 of the Summary is modified to provide that the monthly Base Rent for the Phase II Premises payable by Tenant to Landlord, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Lease shall be deleted, subject to Tenant s continued rent payment obligations set forth in   Section 12   below. Effective as of the AP Commencement Date, Section 4 of the Summary is modified to provide that, in addition to the monthly Base Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord for the Phase I Premises, Tenant shall pay to Landlord monthly Base Rent for the Additional Premises in accordance with Section 3 of the Lease as follows: 
  
   2 
  S:\PFG\Castlight   Health\First Amt\Amt_RV6.docx: 9/21/16 

*Tenant shall not be obligated to pay monthly Base Rent solely with respect to the Additional Premises for the first two (2) full months (e.g., 30 or 31 days, as applicable) following the AP Commencement Date so long as Tenant is not in default under the Lease after the expiration of applicable notice and grace periods, as more particularly described in the immediately following sentence. If, at any time, Tenant is in default of any term, condition or provision of the Lease beyond applicable notice and grace periods that results in the Landlord exercising any of its remedies pursuant to Article 19 of the Lease, then as part of the recovery set forth in Article 19, Landlord shall be entitled to the recovery of the unamortized balance of the abated monthly Base Rent for the Additional Premises (such amount to be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining Lease Term with respect to the Additional Premises, and the unamortized balance thereof to be determined based upon the unexpired portion of the Lease Term with respect to the Additional Premises as of the date of Tenant's default. For the period commencing on July 1, 2021 and ending on the Revised Expiration Date (i.e., June 30, 2022), the monthly Base Rent with respect to the Phase I Premises shall be $161,713.95 per month. 
  7.      Condition of the Original Premises:   Tenant acknowledges and agrees that its possession of the Original Premises after the Amendment Date is a continuation of Tenant s possession of the Original Premises pursuant to the Lease. Tenant is familiar with the condition of the Original Premises, and agrees that except as set forth in this Section 7, Landlord shall not be obligated to provide or pay for any improvement, remodeling or refurbishment work or services related to the improvement, remodeling or refurbishment of the Original Premises, and Tenant shall accept the Original Premises in its "AS-IS" condition. The foregoing shall not, however, limit Landlord s ongoing maintenance, repair, restoration and service obligations to the extent set forth in the Lease. In addition to the foregoing, Landlord hereby agrees that the unused portion of the Suite 200/400 Allowance (in the amount of $251,683) may be used towards Tenant Improvements in the Original Premises and/or Additional Premises and, notwithstanding the terms of Section 2.1 of Exhibit B to the Lease, shall be available for Tenant's use until December 31, 2017. Any unused portion of the Suite 200/400 Allowance not disbursed to Tenant by December 31, 2017 shall be forfeited by Tenant and all such amounts shall revert back and become Landlord's sole property.

Condition of the Additional Premises:   Subject to the provisions of Section 5 above, on the Early Entry Date, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant possession of the Additional Premises in broom clean condition, free of all personal property and debris, and with the Base Building and the existing Building systems and equipment in good working condition and otherwise in its "AS IS" condition as of the date of this Amendment, and Landlord shall not be obligated to provide or pay for any improvement, remodeling or refurbishment work or services related to the improvement, remodeling or refurbishment of the Additional Premises except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or in   Exhibit B   hereto, and except that nothing herein shall limit Landlord's maintenance, repair, restoration and service obligations set forth in the Lease. The Tenant Improvements (defined in   Exhibit B)   shall be installed in accordance with the terms, conditions, criteria and provisions set forth in   Exhibit B   attached to this Amendment, and not pursuant to Exhibit B attached to the Lease which shall not be applicable to the Additional Premises.

  150 SPEAR STREET, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA   TENANT WORK LETTER 
  This Work Letter ("  Work Letter  ") shall set forth the terms and conditions relating to the construction of improvements for the Additional Premises. All references in this Work Letter to the "Lease" shall mean the relevant portions of the Lease, as defined in the Amendment to which this Work Letter is attached as   Exhibit B. 
  SECTION 1  
  AS-IS CONDITION 
  Landlord has previously constructed, and, subject to Landlord's obligation under Section 1.1.1 of the Lease, Tenant hereby accepts the base, shell and core (i) of the Additional Premises and (ii) of the floor(s) of the Building on which the Additional Premises are located (collectively, the "  Base, Shell and Core  "), in its current "  AS-IS  " condition existing as of the date of the Amendment and AP Commencement Date. Except for the Tenant Improvement Allowance set forth below and Landlord s agreement regarding the Suite 200/400 Allowance set forth in Section 7 of the Amendment, Landlord shall not be obligated to make or pay for any alterations or improvements to the Additional Premises, the Building or the Complex. Upon execution of the Amendment, Landlord shall provide Tenant (or its Architect, as defined below) with Landlord s most recently prepared wet stamped path of travel drawings for the Building. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that, during construction of the initial Tenant Improvements pursuant to this Exhibit B, Hazardous Materials are discovered in the Additional Premises or the Common Areas of the Building that require remediation and/or abatement, then Landlord shall be responsible, at Landlord's sole cost, for any such remediation/abatement to the extent required by applicable governmental agencies.

EXHIBIT 31.1 
  CERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, Giovanni M. Colella, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Castlight Health Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control 
     over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
    
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial 
     reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
    
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
       
           a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
     Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
