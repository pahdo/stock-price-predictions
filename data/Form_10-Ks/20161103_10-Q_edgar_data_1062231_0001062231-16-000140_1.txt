1. 
    ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
       
  Organization    American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (Holdings) and its subsidiaries (collectively, we, our, us or AAM) is a Tier I supplier to the automotive industry.  We manufacture, engineer, design and validate driveline and drivetrain systems and related components and chassis modules for light trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), passenger cars, crossover vehicles and commercial vehicles.  Driveline and drivetrain systems include components that transfer power from the transmission and deliver it to the drive wheels.  Our driveline, drivetrain and related products include axles, chassis modules, driveshafts, power transfer units, transfer cases, chassis and steering components, driveheads, transmission parts, electric drive systems and metal-formed products.  In addition to locations in the United States (U.S.) (Michigan, Ohio and Indiana), we also have offices or facilities in Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Scotland, South Korea, Sweden and Thailand. 
    
  Basis of Presentation      We have prepared the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited but include all normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information set forth herein.  Results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. 
    
  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   presented herein has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for complete consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In order to prepare the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Effect of New Accounting Standards     On August 26, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15 -   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The update addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  This guidance becomes effective at the beginning of our 2018 fiscal year, however early adoption is permitted.  The guidance requires a retrospective transition method.  We are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 -   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    The update is intended to simplify the current guidance for stock-based compensation for a range of issues including: the timing of income statement impact for tax benefits or deficiencies in excess of compensation cost, the classification of tax-related cash flows resulting from share based payments, the allowable threshold for tax withholding without resulting in liability award classification, and a policy election for estimating forfeiture rates or recognizing forfeitures as they occur.  This guidance becomes effective at the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year, however as permitted, we plan to early adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The guidance requires a retrospective, modified-retrospective, or prospective transition method depending on the applicable section of the ASU.  We estimate the effect of implementing this ASU on our Consolidated Balance Sheet would increase our deferred tax assets and retained earnings by approximately   $4.8 million   as of January 1, 2016, using the modified-retrospective transition method, for the cumulative-effect adjustment of excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable.  We have evaluated the aspects of this new guidance and, other than this one-time increase in deferred tax assets and retained earnings, the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on our accounting for share-based payments.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 -   Leases (Topic 842),   which supersedes the existing lease accounting guidance and establishes new criteria for recognizing lease assets and liabilities.  The most significant impact of the update, to AAM, is that a lessee will be required to recognize a "right-of-use" asset and lease liability for operating lease agreements that were not previously included on the balance sheet under the existing lease guidance.  A lessee will be permitted to make a policy election, excluding recognition of the right-of-use asset and associated liability for lease terms of 12 months or less.  Expense recognition in the statement of income along with cash flow statement classification for both financing (capital) and operating leases under the new standard will not be significantly changed from existing lease guidance.  Accounting for leases as a lessor under the new guidance remains also largely unchanged.  This guidance becomes effective for AAM at the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year and requires transition under a modified retrospective method.  We are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07 -   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  , which changes the disclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value (NAV) per share.  Under current accounting standards entities are permitted to estimate the fair value of certain investments using the investment's NAV as a practical expedient.  The current disclosure guidance also permits entities to disclose the investment at NAV in the fair value hierarchy table as either Level 2 or Level 3, based upon certain criteria.  The measurement basis utilizing NAV is different than the measurement criteria of all other investments which utilize inputs to calculate fair value.  Due to this inconsistency, the FASB issued this ASU which prohibits entities from categorizing investments measured at NAV within the fair value hierarchy.  Other than the change in presentation, which requires retrospective application, the adoption of this new guidance will not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  AAM adopted this policy on January 1, 2016. 
    
  In 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 -   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The guidance is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.  Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard.  On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 -   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),   to further clarify the new standard's guidance on identifying gross versus net reporting in the context of a contract.  Based on the clarification, an entity should analyze the principal versus agent relationship for each specified good or service within a contract.  On April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 -   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   which better articulates the principle for determining whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable in the context of the contract.  The guidance also excludes from an entity's performance obligation analysis, the requirement to assess certain promised contract goods and services deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.  On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 -   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which addresses improvements to the guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts at transition.  The update also provides a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and a policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers.  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 -   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , to formally defer the initial standard's effective date by one-year, making this guidance effective for AAM at the beginning of our 2018 fiscal year.  We are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Long-lived Assets    In the third quarter of 2016, we identified an indicator of impairment at a location in India due to changes in forecasted cash flows.  Accordingly, we performed an assessment of the recoverability of these assets and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of   $3.4 million   to cost of goods sold to write the assets down to fair value. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program    In May of 2016, AAM's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $100 million   of AAM's common shares through December 31, 2018 as part of AAM's overall capital allocation strategy.  The repurchase of shares may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and will be funded through available cash balances and cash flow from operations.  The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on market and economic conditions, share price, alternative uses of capital and other factors. Approximately   $1.5 million   of shares have been repurchased under the authorized share repurchase program, leaving approximately   $98.5 million   available for repurchase.  There were no repurchases under the program in the third quarter of 2016.

    INVENTORIES 
       
  We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of our inventories is determined using the first-in first-out method.  When we determine that our gross inventories exceed usage requirements, or if inventories become obsolete or otherwise not saleable, we record a provision for such loss as a component of our inventory accounts. 
    
   Inventories consist of the following:

    LONG-TERM DEBT 
       
  Long-term debt consists of the following: 

Revolving Credit Facility    As of   September 30, 2016  , the revolving credit facility provided up to   $523.5 million   of revolving bank financing commitments through September 13, 2018.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $513.1 million   available under the revolving credit facility.  This availability reflects a reduction of   $10.4 million   for standby letters of credit issued against the facility.   
    
  The revolving credit facility provides back-up liquidity for our foreign credit facilities.  We intend to use the availability of long-term financing under the revolving credit facility to refinance any current maturities related to such debt agreements that are not otherwise refinanced on a long-term basis in their local markets, except where otherwise reclassified to current portion of long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Foreign credit facilities    We utilize local currency credit facilities to finance the operations of certain foreign subsidiaries.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased the borrowings on our foreign credit facilities, primarily to fund capital expenditures and working capital in preparation for the launch of programs in China beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $61.4 million   was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional   $64.7 million   was available.  
    
  The weighted-average interest rate of our long-term debt outstanding was   6.6%   at   September 30, 2016   and   6.5%   at   December 31, 2015  .

    FAIR VALUE 
       
  Accounting Standards Codification 820 - Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as  the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.   The definition is based on an exit price rather than an entry price, regardless of whether the entity plans to hold or sell the asset.  This guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1:  Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
                
    Level 2:  Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
                
    Level 3:  Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
       
  Financial instruments     The estimated fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, using available market information and other observable data, are as follows: 

The carrying values of our cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.  The carrying values of our borrowings under the foreign credit facilities approximate their fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates.

    DERIVATIVES 
       
  Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including interest rates and currency exchange rates.  Our hedging policy has been developed to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost.  We do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Currency forward contracts    From time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily relating to the Mexican Peso, Euro, Brazilian Real, British Pound Sterling, Thai Baht, Swedish Krona, Chinese Yuan and Polish Zloty.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have currency forward contracts outstanding with a notional amount of   $183.0 million   that hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for certain payroll expenses into the third quarter of 2019 and certain direct and indirect inventory and other working capital items into the first quarter of 2017.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
       
   The components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) are as follows: 

The noncurrent liabilities associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are classified as postretirement benefits and other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have a noncurrent pension liability of   $98.0 million   and   $103.1 million  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have a noncurrent other postretirement benefits liability of   $542.9 million   and   $559.0 million  , respectively. 
    
  Due to the availability of our prefunding balances (previous contributions in excess of prior required pension contributions) for our U.S. pension plans and our contributions made in 2015 for our U.K. pension plan, we are not required to make any cash payments to our pension trusts in 2016.  We expect our cash payments for other postretirement benefit obligations in 2016, net of GM cost sharing, to be approximately   $16 million  .

    PRODUCT WARRANTIES 
       
   We record a liability for estimated warranty obligations at the dates our products are sold. These estimates are established using sales volumes and internal and external warranty data where there is no payment history and historical information about the average cost of warranty claims for customers with prior claims. We estimate our costs based on the contractual arrangements with our customers, existing customer warranty terms and internal and external warranty data, which includes a determination of our warranty claims and actions taken to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. We continuously evaluate these estimates and our customers' administration of their warranty programs. We closely monitor actual warranty claim data and adjust the liability, as necessary, on a quarterly basis. 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the product warranty liability: 

8. 
    INCOME TAXES 
       
   We are required to adjust our effective tax rate each quarter to estimate our annual effective tax rate.  We must also record the tax impact of certain discrete, unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, in the interim period in which they occur.  In addition, jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year or a year-to-date loss where no tax benefit can be recognized are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate.  The impact of such an exclusion could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter, based upon the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections. 
    
   Income tax expense was   $17.8 million   in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $14.4 million   in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our effective income tax rate was   22.4%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   19.3%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Income tax expense was   $53.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $36.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our effective income tax rate was   21.7%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   17.5%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are higher than our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of an increase in the proportionate share of income attributable to higher tax rate jurisdictions.  Our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   reflect the impact of favorable foreign tax rates, partially offset by our inability to realize a tax benefit for current foreign losses.  
    
   Based on the status of audits outside the U.S., and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, it is not possible to estimate the timing or impact of changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we have recorded a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties of   $32.0 million   and   $48.5 million  , respectively.  In January 2016, we completed negotiations with the Mexican tax authorities to settle transfer pricing audits.  Including these settlements, we made payments of   $26.1 million   in the first nine months of 2016 to the Mexican tax authorities related to transfer pricing matters and we expect our total transfer pricing related payments in 2016 to be approximately   $30 million  .

    AMERICAN AXLE   MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

Although it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our tax liabilities for the years that remain subject to audit, we do not expect the settlements will be materially different from what we have recorded in unrecognized tax benefits.  We will continue to monitor the progress and conclusions of current and future audits and will adjust our estimated liability as necessary.  

9. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) 
       
  We present earnings per share using the two-class method.  This method allocates undistributed earnings between common shares and non-vested share based payment awards that entitle the holder to non-forfeitable dividend rights.  Our participating securities include non-vested restricted stock units. 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of our basic and diluted EPS available to shareholders of common stock (excluding participating securities):    

Certain exercisable stock options were excluded from the computations of diluted EPS because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average period market prices.  The number of stock options outstanding, which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS, was   0.2 million  , with an exercise price of   $26.02  , at both   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

  On November 3, 2016, AAM entered into a definitive merger agreement with Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (MPG) under which AAM will acquire MPG for approximately   $1.6 billion   in cash and stock, plus the assumption of   $1.7 billion   in net debt (comprised of approximately   $1.8 billion   in debt, reduced by approximately   $0.1 billion   of MPG cash and cash equivalents). Under the terms of the agreement, each share of MPG's common stock will be converted into the right to receive   $13.50   per share in cash and   0.5   share of AAM common stock. Upon closing of the transaction, AAM's shareholders will own approximately   70%   of the combined company and MPG's shareholders will own approximately   30%  . The transaction has been approved by the board of directors of both AAM and MPG, and is now subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

  This management s discussion and analysis (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we," "our," "us" or "AAM" shall mean collectively (i) American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

Holdings has no subsidiaries other than AAM, Inc. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a Tier I supplier to the automotive industry.  We manufacture, engineer, design and validate driveline and drivetrain systems and related components and chassis modules for light trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), passenger cars, crossover vehicles and commercial vehicles.  Driveline and drivetrain systems include components that transfer power from the transmission and deliver it to the drive wheels.  Our driveline, drivetrain and related products include axles, chassis modules, driveshafts, power transfer units, transfer cases, chassis and steering components, driveheads, transmission parts, electric drive systems and metal-formed products.  In addition to locations in the United States (U.S.) (Michigan, Ohio and Indiana), we also have offices or facilities in Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Scotland, South Korea, Sweden and Thailand. 
    
  We are the principal supplier of driveline components to General Motors Company (GM) for its full-size rear-wheel drive (RWD) light trucks and SUVs manufactured in North America, supplying substantially all of GM s rear axle and four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (4WD/AWD) axle requirements for these vehicle platforms.  Sales to GM were approximately   68%   of our consolidated net sales in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   66%   of our consolidated net sales for both the first   nine   months and the full year of   2015  . 
    
  We are the sole-source supplier to GM for certain axles and other driveline products for the life of each GM vehicle program covered by Lifetime Program Contracts and Long Term Program Contracts (collectively, LPCs).  Substantially all of our sales to GM are made pursuant to the LPCs.  The LPCs have terms equal to the lives of the relevant vehicle programs or their respective derivatives, which typically run five to seven years, and require us to remain competitive with respect to technology, design, quality and cost. 
    
  We also supply driveline system products to FCA US LLC (FCA) for heavy-duty Ram full-size pickup trucks and its derivatives, the AWD Jeep Cherokee, and a passenger car driveshaft program.  Sales to FCA were approximately   19%   of our consolidated net sales in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   20%   of our consolidated net sales for both the first   nine   months and the full year of   2015  .  In addition to GM and FCA, we supply driveline systems and other related components to Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Nissan), Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen AG (Volkswagen), Audi AG (Audi), Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC (JLR), Honda Motor Co., Ltd., Ford Motor Company (Ford), PACCAR Inc., Daimler Truck, Harley-Davidson Inc. and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and Tier I supplier companies such as Jatco Ltd. and Hino Motors Ltd.  Our consolidated net sales to customers other than GM were   $964.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to   $993.6 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    THREE MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   AS COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    
    
   Net Sales    Net sales increased to   $1,006.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $971.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Our sales in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , reflect an increase of approximately   8%   in production volumes for the North American light truck and SUV programs we currently support, which was partially offset by a reduction of approximately $7.0 million in commercial vehicle sales due to an expired program. 
    
  Our content-per-vehicle (CPV) (as measured by the dollar value of our products supporting our customers' North American light truck and SUV programs) was   $1,612   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $1,622   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The change in CPV in the   third   quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, relates primarily to the impact of annual productivity price-downs for certain programs.  Our 4WD/AWD penetration rate was   71%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   70%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
    
  Cost of Goods Sold    Cost of goods sold was   $825.7 million   in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to   $813.3 million   in the third quarter of 2015. The change in cost of goods sold reflects the net impact of approximately $12.0 million related to an increase in sales volumes and a product mix change in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, and the impact of lower net manufacturing costs and productivity initiatives. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, material costs were approximately 68% of total costs of goods sold. 
    
  Gross Profit     Gross profit increased to   $181.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $158.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Gross margin increased to   18.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   16.3%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The increase in gross profit in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflects the benefit of increased contribution margin on higher production volumes for the North American light truck and SUV programs that we support.  Gross profit and gross margin were also impacted by the other factors discussed in Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold above. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG A)    SG A (including research and development (R D)) was   $79.9 million   or   7.9%   of net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $65.5 million   or   6.7%   of net sales in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  R D, net of customer engineering, design and development (ED D) recoveries, was   $36.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $25.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The change in SG A in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , is primarily due to the increase in R D expense. 
    
  Operating Income    Operating income increased to   $101.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $92.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Operating margin increased to   10.1%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   9.5%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The changes in operating income and operating margin were due to factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold and SG A above. 
    
  Interest Expense and Investment Income    Interest expense decreased to   $23.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $24.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Investment income was   $0.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $0.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
    
  The weighted-average interest rate of our long-term debt outstanding was   6.7%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   6.3%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .   
    
  Other Income, Net    Other income, net, which includes the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses and our proportionate share of earnings from equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries, was   $0.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $6.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The change in other income, net in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, is principally attributable to remeasurement of our Mexican Peso denominated assets and liabilities. 
    
  Income Tax Expense    Income tax expense was   $17.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $14.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Our effective income tax rate was   22.4%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   19.3%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .   
    
  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is higher than our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of an increase in the proportionate share of income attributable to  
  
    27 

higher tax rate jurisdictions.  Our income tax expense and effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   reflect the impact of favorable foreign tax rates, partially offset by our inability to realize a tax benefit for current foreign losses.  
    
  Net Income and Earnings Per Share (EPS)    Net income increased to   $61.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $60.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Diluted EPS was   $0.78   in the   third   quarter of both   2016   and   2015  .  Net income and EPS for the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   were primarily impacted by the factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold and SG A above.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    NINE MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   AS COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    
    
   Net Sales    Net sales increased to   $3,001.5 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $2,944.7 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Our sales in the   first nine months   of   2016  , as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , reflect an increase of approximately   9%   in production volumes for the North American light truck and SUV programs we currently support. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of approximately $46.0 million in commercial vehicle sales due to an expired program, $15.0 million related to reduced production volumes on a program in Brazil, and reductions in both metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. 
    
  Our content-per-vehicle (as measured by the dollar value of our products supporting our customers' North American light truck and SUV programs) was   $1,611   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $1,645   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  The change in CPV in the   first nine months   of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, relates primarily to the reduction in metal market pass-throughs to our customers, as well as the impact of annual productivity price-downs for certain programs.  Our 4WD/AWD penetration rate was   71%   in the   first nine months   of both   2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Cost of Goods Sold    Cost of goods sold decreased to   $2,454.9 million   in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to   $2,469.1 million   in the first nine months of 2015. The change in cost of goods sold reflects the net impact of approximately $30.0 million related to an increase in sales volumes and a product mix change in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, and the impact of lower net manufacturing costs and productivity initiatives. Cost of goods sold was also impacted by a reduction of approximately $45.0 million related to metal market pass-through costs and foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, material costs were approximately 69% of total costs of goods sold. 
    
  Gross Profit     Gross profit increased to   $546.6 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $475.6 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Gross margin increased to   18.2%   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   16.1%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  The increase in gross profit in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, reflects the benefit of increased contribution margin on higher production volumes for the North American light truck and SUV programs that we support.  Gross profit and gross margin were also impacted by the other factors discussed in Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold above. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    SG A (including research and development) was   $235.4 million   or   7.8%   of net sales in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $204.6 million   or   6.9%   of net sales in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  R D, net of customer engineering, design and development recoveries, was   $102.3 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $82.6 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  The change in SG A in the   first nine months   of   2016  , as compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , is primarily due to higher R D expense and higher incentive compensation accruals. 
    
  Operating Income    Operating income increased to   $311.2 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $271.0 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Operating margin increased to   10.4%   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   9.2%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  The changes in operating income and operating margin were due to factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold and SG A above. 
    
  Interest Expense and Investment Income    Interest expense decreased to   $70.2 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $74.7 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Investment income increased to   $2.6 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $2.0 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  

28 

The weighted-average interest rate of our long-term debt outstanding was   6.7%   in the   first nine months   of   2016   and   6.4%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .   
    
  Other Income, Net    Other income, net, which includes the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses and our proportionate share of earnings from equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries, was   $4.0 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $10.9 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . The change in other income, net in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, is principally attributable to remeasurement of our Mexican Peso denominated assets and liabilities. 
    
  Income Tax Expense    Income tax expense was   $53.8 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $36.5 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Our effective income tax rate was   21.7%   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   17.5%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .   
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is higher than our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of an increase in the proportionate share of income attributable to higher tax rate jurisdictions.  Our income tax expense and effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   reflect the impact of favorable foreign tax rates, partially offset by our inability to realize a tax benefit for current foreign losses.  
    
  Net Income and Earnings Per Share    Net income increased to   $193.8 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $172.7 million   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Diluted EPS increased to   $2.47   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   $2.21   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  Net income and EPS for the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015   were primarily impacted by the factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, SG A and Income Tax Expense above.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures, debt service obligations and working capital requirements.  We believe that operating cash flow, available cash and cash equivalent balances and available committed borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs.  
    
  Operating Activities    In the first   nine   months of   2016  , net cash provided by operating activities increased to   $291.0 million   as compared to   $268.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The following factors impacted cash provided by operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  : 
    
  Net income    Net income increased to   $193.8 million   in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to   $172.7 million   in the first nine months of 2015.  The increase in net income in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was the result of the factors discussed in the Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 section of this MD A. 
    
  Accounts payable    Accounts payable at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were   $497.7 million   and   $479.8 million  , respectively, as compared to   $412.7 million   and   $444.3 million   at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in accounts payable balances during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers. 
    
  Income taxes    Based on the status of audits outside the U.S., and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, it is not possible to estimate the timing or impact of changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we have recorded a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties of   $32.0 million   and   $48.5 million  , respectively.  In January 2016, we completed negotiations with the Mexican tax authorities to settle transfer pricing audits.  Including these settlements, we made payments of   $26.1 million   in the first nine months of 2016 to the Mexican tax authorities related to transfer pricing matters and we expect our total transfer pricing related payments in 2016 to be approximately   $30 million  . 
    
   Although it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our tax liabilities for the years that remain subject to audit, we do not expect the settlements will be materially different from what we have recorded in unrecognized tax benefits.  We will continue to monitor the progress and conclusions of current and future audits and will adjust our estimated liability as necessary.  

29 

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  (OPEB)        Due to the availability of our prefunding balances (previous contributions in excess of prior required pension contributions) for our U.S. pension plans and our contributions made in 2015 for our U.K. pension plan, we are not required to make any cash payments to our pension trusts in 2016.  We expect our cash payments for other postretirement benefit obligations in 2016, net of GM cost sharing, to be approximately $16 million. 
    
  Investing Activities    Capital expenditures were   $158.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to   $132.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  We expect our capital spending to be approximately 6% of sales in 2016, which includes support for our global program launches within our new and incremental business backlog. 
    
  Financing Activities    In the first   nine   months of   2016  , net cash provided by financing activities was   $17.6 million   as compared to a use of   $8.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The following factors impacted cash provided by (used in) financing activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  : 
    
  Total debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs    Total debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, increased by   $25.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   to   $1,404.4 million   as compared to   $1,379.0 million   at year-end   2015  . 
    
  Revolving Credit Facility and Term Facility    As of   September 30, 2016  , the revolving credit facility provided up to $523.5 million of revolving bank financing commitments through September 13, 2018.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $513.1 million   available under the revolving credit facility.  This availability reflects a reduction of   $10.4 million   for standby letters of credit issued against the facility. 
    
  The credit agreement provided for a senior secured term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million (term facility), which we elected to voluntarily repay in December 2015.  During the first nine months of 2015, we made principal payments on our term facility of $6.6 million. 
    
  The revolving credit facility provides back-up liquidity for our foreign credit facilities.  We intend to use the availability of long-term financing under the revolving credit facility to refinance any current maturities related to such debt agreements that are not otherwise refinanced on a long-term basis in their local markets, except where otherwise reclassified to current portion of long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Foreign credit facilities    We utilize local currency credit facilities to finance the operations of certain foreign subsidiaries.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased the borrowings on our foreign credit facilities, primarily to fund capital expenditures and working capital in preparation for the launch of programs in China beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $61.4 million   was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional   $64.7 million   was available.  
    
  Treasury stock    Treasury stock increased by   $5.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   to   $191.2 million   as compared to   $185.9 million   at year-end   2015  , due to the withholding and repurchase of shares of AAM stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units, as well as an initial share repurchase under the authorized share repurchase program.  

CYCLICALITY AND SEASONALITY 
    
  Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is itself cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors.  Our business is also moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1-2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December.  Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends. 

30 

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
    
  We are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business.  Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We will continue to closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with all laws, regulations and ordinances.  We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures (including recurring administrative costs) to comply with environmental requirements.  Such expenditures were not significant in the   third   quarter of   2016  , and we do not expect such expenditures to be significant for the remainder of   2016  . 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  MARKET RISK 
    
  Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including interest rates and currency exchange rates.  Our hedging policy has been developed to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost.  We do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Currency Exchange Risk    From time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily relating to the Mexican Peso, Euro, Brazilian Real, British Pound Sterling, Thai Baht, Swedish Krona, Chinese Yuan and Polish Zloty.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had currency forward contracts with a notional amount of   $183.0 million   outstanding.  The potential decrease in fair value of foreign exchange contracts, assuming a 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates, would be approximately   $16.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and was approximately $17.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Future business operations and opportunities, including the expansion of our business outside North America, may further increase the risk that cash flows resulting from these global operations may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates.  If and when appropriate, we intend to manage these risks by creating hedges in the structure of our global operations, utilizing local currency funding of these expansions and various types of foreign exchange contracts. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk    We are exposed to variable interest rates on certain credit facilities.  From time to time, we have used interest rate hedging to reduce the effects of fluctuations in market interest rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are no interest rate swaps in place.  The pre-tax earnings and cash flow impact of a one-percentage-point increase in interest rates (approximately 15% of our weighted-average interest rate at   September 30, 2016  ) on our long-term debt outstanding, would be approximately   $0.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and was approximately   $0.3 million   at December 31, 2015, on an annualized basis. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

31 

PART II.  OTHER  INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  There were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our   December 31, 2015   Form 10-K. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
    
  On May 5, 2016, AAM's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $100 million of AAM's common shares through December 31, 2018 as part of AAM's overall capital allocation strategy.  The repurchase of shares may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and will be funded through available cash balances and cash flow from operations.  The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on market and economic conditions, share price, alternative uses of capital and other factors. There were no repurchases under the authorized share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016 and there is approximately $98.5 million available for repurchase. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we withheld and repurchased shares of AAM stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of performance shares and restricted stock units.  The following table provides information about our equity security purchases during the quarter ended September 30, 2016:
