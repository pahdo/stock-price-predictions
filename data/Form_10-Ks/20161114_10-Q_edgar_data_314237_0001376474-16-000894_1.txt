 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1 - Organization And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  General  
   
 The information contained in the following notes to the unaudited financial statements is condensed from that which would appear in the annual audited financial statements; accordingly, the financial statements included herein should be reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto contained in the annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 prepared by Real Estate Associates Limited II (the  Partnership ). Accounting measurements at interim dates inherently involve greater reliance on estimates than at year end. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. 
   
 In the opinion of the Partnership s management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring items) considered necessary for a fair presentation. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 
   
 The general partners share a one percent interest in profits and losses of the Partnership.  The limited partners share the remaining 99 percent interest which is allocated in proportion to their respective individual investments. The general partners of the Partnership are National Partnership Investments Associates, a California limited partnership, and National Partnership Investments, LLC, a California limited liability company ( NAPICO  or the  General Partner ).  The General Partner is a subsidiary of Bethesda Holdings II, LLC, a privately held real estate asset management company ( Bethesda ). 
   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 10,507 limited partnership interests outstanding.  
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
   
  Method of Accounting for Investments in Local Limited Partnerships  
   
 The investment in a local limited partnership (the  Local Limited Partnership ) is accounted for using the equity method.   
   
  Net Income (Loss) Per Limited Partnership Interest  
   
 Net income (loss) per limited partnership interest was computed by dividing the limited partners  share of net income (loss) by the number of limited partnership interests outstanding at the beginning of the year. The number of limited partnership interests used was 10,507 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

5 

Note 1 - Organization And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 
   
  Variable Interest Entities  
   
 The Partnership consolidates any variable interest entities in which the Partnership holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. Generally, a variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the entity that has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
   
 In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Partnership considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of the Partnership s investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Partnership or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of the Partnership and the other investors.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by this VIE and general market conditions.  
   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership held variable interests in one VIE for which the Partnership was not the primary beneficiary. The Partnership has concluded, based on its qualitative consideration of the partnership agreement of the Local Limited Partnership, the partnership structure and the role of the general partner in the Local Limited Partnership, that the general partner of the Local Limited Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the respective Local Limited Partnership. In making this determination, the Partnership considered the following factors: 

the general partner conducts and manages the business of the Local Limited Partnership; 
   
 the general partner has the responsibility for and sole discretion over selecting a property management agent for the Local Limited Partnership's underlying real estate properties; 
   
 the general partner is responsible for approving operating and capital budgets for the properties owned by the Local Limited Partnership; 
   
 the general partner is obligated to fund any recourse obligations of the Local Limited Partnership;  
   
 the general partner is authorized to borrow funds on behalf of the Local Limited Partnership; and 
   
 the Partnership, as a limited partner in the Local Limited Partnership, does not have the ability to direct or otherwise significantly influence the activities of the Local Limited Partnership that most significantly impact such entity's economic performance. 

6 

Note 1 - Organization And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 
   
 The one VIE at September 30, 2016 consisted of a Local Limited Partnership that is directly engaged in the ownership and management of one apartment property with a total of 48 units.  The Partnership is involved with the VIE as a non-controlling limited partner equity holder. The Partnership s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the unconsolidated VIE is limited to the Partnership s recorded investments in and receivables from this VIE, which were zero at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Partnership may be subject to additional losses to the extent of any financial support that the Partnership voluntarily provides in the future .  
   
  Note 2 - Investments in and Advances to Local Limited Partnership  
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership held limited partnership interests in one Local Limited Partnership. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Local Limited Partnership owned a residential low income rental project consisting of 48 apartment units (the  Project ).  The mortgage loans of this Project are payable to or insured by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ).   
   
 The Partnership, as a limited partner, does not have a contractual relationship with the Local Limited Partnership or exercise control over the activities and operations, including refinancing or selling decisions, of the Local Limited Partnership that would require or allow for consolidation. Accordingly, the Partnership accounts for its investment in the Local Limited Partnership using the equity method. The Partnership is allocated profits and losses of the Local Limited Partnership based upon its respective ownership percentage (99%). Distributions of surplus cash from operations from the Local Limited Partnership are restricted by the Local Limited Partnership's Regulatory Agreements with HUD and/or are restricted by the terms of the mortgages encumbering the Project. These restrictions limit the distribution to a portion, generally less than 10%, of the initial invested capital. The Partnership is allocated profits and losses and receives distributions from refinancings and sales in accordance with the Local Limited Partnership's partnership agreement. This agreement limits the Partnership s distributions to an amount substantially less than its ownership percentage in the Local Limited Partnership.  
   
 The investment is carried at cost plus the Partnership s share of the Local Limited Partnership s profits less the Partnership s share of the Local Limited Partnership s losses, distributions and impairment charges. The Partnership is not legally liable for the obligations of the Local Limited Partnership and is not otherwise committed to provide additional support to it. Therefore, it does not recognize losses once its investment in the Local Limited Partnership reaches zero. Distributions from the Local Limited Partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance until the investment balance is reduced to zero. When the investment balance has been reduced to zero, subsequent distributions received are recognized as income in the accompanying unaudited statements of operations. Operating distributions from the Local Limited Partnership in which the Partnership s investment in the Local Limited Partnership has been reduced to zero were approximately $9,000 and $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

7 

Note 2 - Investments in and Advances to the Local Limited Partnership  (continued) 
   
 At times, advances are made to the Local Limited Partnership. Advances made by the Partnership to the Local Limited Partnership are considered part of the Partnership s investment in the limited partnership. Advances made to the Local Limited Partnership for which the investment has been reduced to zero are generally charged to expense. There were no advances made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 For those investments where the Partnership has determined that the carrying value of its investments approximates the estimated fair value of those investments, the Partnership s policy is to recognize equity in income of the Local Limited Partnership only to the extent of distributions received and amortization of acquisition costs from the Local Limited Partnership.  Therefore, the Partnership limits its recognition of equity earnings to the amount it expects to ultimately realize. 
   
 The Partnership had no carrying value in the investment in the Local Limited Partnership as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
   
 The following are unaudited condensed combined estimated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the Local Limited Partnership in which the Partnership has invested: 

Note 3   Transactions With Affiliated Parties  
   
 Under the terms of the Partnership s Restated Certificate and Agreement of Limited Partnership, dated December 3, 1979, as amended on January 12, 2005 (the Partnership Agreement ), the Partnership is liable to NAPICO for an annual management fee equal to 0.4 percent of the Partnership s original remaining invested assets of the Local Limited Partnership, calculated at the beginning of each year. Invested assets are defined as the costs of acquiring project interests, including the proportionate amount of the mortgage loans related to the Partnership s interests in the capital accounts of the Local Limited Partnership. The management fee was approximately $5,000 and $6,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 Additionally, the Partnership reimburses NAPICO for administrative expenses incurred by NAPICO on behalf of the Partnership but paid by NAPICO for convenience. These reimbursed expenses were approximately $14,000 and $10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

8 

Note 4   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825,  Financial Instruments,  requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  The Partnership believes that the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities at September 30, 2016 approximated their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.  
   
  Note 5   Contingencies   
   
 The General Partner is involved in various lawsuits arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management and the General Partner, such claims will not result in any material liability to the Partnership. 
   
  Note 6   Subsequent Events  
   
 The Partnership s management evaluated subsequent events through the time this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was filed.

ITEM 2.  
   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements in certain circumstances. Certain information included in this Quarterly Report contains or may contain information that is forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws and/or that is based on the Partnership s current expectations, estimates and projections, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the Partnership s business strategies, growth opportunities, competitive position, market outlook, expected financial position, expected results of operations, future cash flows, financing plans and plans and objectives of management, and any other statements regarding future growth, future cash needs, future operations, business plans and future financial results. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Partnership s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. The words  believe,   anticipate,   intend,   aim,   expect,   strive,   plan,   estimate,   could,   should,   would,   predict,   forecast  and  project  and similar words identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve potential risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and  , in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond the Partnership s control, including, without limitation: financing risks, including the availability and cost of financing and the risk that the Partnership s cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the terms of governmental regulations that affect the Partnership and its investment in the Local Limited Partnership and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which the Partnership operates; real estate risks, including fluctuations in   real estate values and the general economic climate in local markets and competition for residents   in such markets  ; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by the limited partnerships in which the Partnership has invested. The Partnership does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements, except as required by federal securities laws. Readers should carefully review the Partnership s financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the other documents the Partnership files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
 The General Partner monitors developments in the area of legal and regulatory compliance.  

10 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 The Partnership's primary source of funds consists of distributions from the Local Limited Partnership in which the Partnership has invested. It is not expected that the Local Limited Partnership in which the Partnership has invested will generate cash flow from operations sufficient to provide for distributions to limited partners in any material amount. An infrequent source of funds would be funds received by the Partnership as its share of any proceeds from the sale of a property owned by a Local Limited Partnership or the Partnership s sale of its interest in a Local Limited Partnership.  
   
 The property in which the Partnership has invested, through its investments in the Local Limited Partnership, receives one or more forms of assistance from the Federal Government. As a result, the Local Limited Partnership's ability to transfer funds to the Partnership in the form of distributions, loans or advances is generally restricted by these government assistance programs. These restrictions, however, are not expected to impact the Partnership s ability to meet its cash obligations.  
   
 Distributions received from the Local Limited Partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance until the investment balance has been reduced to zero. Subsequent distributions received are recognized as income. Operating distributions from the Local Limited Partnership in which the Partnership s investment in the Local Limited Partnership has been reduced to zero were approximately $9,000 and $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $429,000 and $512,000, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are on deposit with a financial institution. The reduction is cash is due to payment of expenses. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had and continues to have investments in one Local Limited Partnership, which owns a housing project that was substantially rented as of such dates. The Partnership, as a limited partner, does not have a contractual relationship with the Local Limited Partnership or exercise control over the activities and operations, including refinancing or selling decisions, of the Local Limited Partnership that would require or allow for consolidation. Accordingly, the Partnership accounts for its investment in the Local Limited Partnership using the equity method. Thus, the individual investment is carried at cost plus the Partnership s share of the Local Limited Partnership s profits less the Partnership s share of the Local Limited Partnership s losses, distributions and impairment charges. However, since the Partnership is not legally liable for the obligations of the Local Limited Partnership, or is not otherwise committed to provide additional support to it, it does not recognize losses once its investment in the Local Limited Partnership reaches zero. Distributions from the Local Limited Partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance until the investment balance is reduced to zero. Subsequent distributions received are recognized as income in the statements of operations.  For those investments where the Partnership has determined that the carrying value of its investments approximates the estimated fair value of those investments, the Partnership s policy is to recognize equity in income of the Local Limited Partnership only to the extent of distributions received and amortization of acquisition costs from the Local Limited Partnership. Therefore, the Partnership limits its recognition of equity to the amount it expects to ultimately realize. The Partnership recognized no equity earnings related to its investment in limited partnerships for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as the Partnership s investment in the Local Limited Partnership had been reduced to zero prior to January 1, 2012. 

11 

At times, advances are made to the Local Limited Partnership. Advances made by the Partnership to the Local Limited Partnership are considered part of the Partnership s investment in the limited partnership. Advances made to the Local Limited Partnership for which the investment has been reduced to zero are generally charged to expense.  There were no advances made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 A recurring partnership expense is the annual management fee.  The fee is payable to the General Partner and is calculated at 0.4 percent of the Partnership's original remaining invested assets at the beginning of each year.  The management fee is paid to the General Partner for its continuing management of Partnership affairs. Management fees were approximately $5,000 and $6,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively and $2,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 Operating expenses, other than management fees, consist of legal and accounting fees for services rendered to the Partnership and general and administrative expenses. Legal and accounting fees were approximately $27,000 and $21,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and approximately $6,000 and $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in legal and accounting expense, year-to-date was due to increased legal fees. General and administrative expenses were approximately $27,000 and $20,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $10,000 and $4,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to an increase in investor relations expenses.  
   
 The Partnership, as a limited partner in the Local Limited Partnership in which it has invested, is subject to the risks incident to the construction, management, and ownership of improved real estate.  The Partnership s investments are also subject to adverse general economic conditions, and accordingly, the status of the national economy, including substantial unemployment, concurrent inflation and changing legislation, which could increase vacancy levels, rental payment defaults, and operating expenses, which in turn could substantially increase the risk of operating losses for the Project. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 The Partnership owns limited partnership interests in an unconsolidated Local Limited Partnership, in which the Partnership s ownership percentage is 99%. However, based on the provisions of the partnership agreement of the Local Limited Partnership, the Partnership, as a limited partner, does not have control or a contractual relationship with the Local Limited Partnership that would require or allow for consolidation under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (see  Note 1   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the financial statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements ).  There are no lines of credit, side agreements or any other derivative financial instruments between the Local Limited Partnership and the Partnership.  Accordingly, the Partnership s maximum risk of loss related to this unconsolidated Local Limited Partnership is limited to the recorded investments in and receivables from the Local Limited Partnership.  See  Note 2   Investments in and Advances to Local Limited Partnership  of the financial statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements  for additional information about the Partnership s investments in the unconsolidated Local Limited Partnership. 

12 

Other  
   
 Bethesda and its affiliates owned 183 Units or 366 limited partnership interests in the Partnership representing 3.48% of the outstanding limited partnership interests in the Partnership at September 30, 2016. A  Unit  consists of two limited partnership interests. It is possible that Bethesda or its affiliates will acquire additional limited partnership interests in the Partnership, either through private purchases or tender offers.  Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, unitholders holding a majority of the limited partnership interests are entitled to take action with respect to a variety of matters that include, but are not limited to, voting on certain amendments to the Partnership Agreement and voting to remove the General Partner. Additionally, Bethesda has entered into a management agreement with a holder of 870 Units or 1,740 limited partnership interests in the Partnership representing 16.56% of the outstanding limited partnership interests in the Partnership as of September 30, 2016. Pursuant to such management agreement, Bethesda manages the business of such holder in exchange for a management fee, part of which includes all payments received by such holder with respect to such holder s ownership of limited partnership interests in the Partnership.  Although the General Partner owes fiduciary duties to the limited partners of the Partnership, the General Partner also owes fiduciary duties to Bethesda as its sole stockholder. As a result, the duties of the General Partner, as general partner, to the Partnership and its limited partners may come into conflict with the duties of the General Partner to Bethesda as its sole stockholder. 
   
  Variable Interest Entities  
   
 The Partnership consolidates any variable interest entities in which the Partnership holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. Generally, a variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the entity that has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
   
 In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Partnership considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of the Partnership s investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Partnership or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of the Partnership and the other investors.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by this VIE and general market conditions.  

13 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership held variable interests in one VIE, the Local Limited Partnership, for which the Partnership was not the primary beneficiary.  The Partnership has concluded, based on its qualitative consideration of the partnership agreement, the partnership structure and the role of the general partner in the Local Limited Partnership, that the general partner of the Local Limited Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the Local Limited Partnership. In making this determination, the Partnership considered the following factors: 

the general partner conducts and manages the business of the Local Limited Partnership; 
   
 the general partner has the responsibility for and sole discretion over selecting a property management agent for the Local Limited Partnership s underlying real estate properties; 
   
 the general partner is responsible for approving operating and capital budgets for the properties owned by the Local Limited Partnership; 
   
 the general partner is obligated to fund any recourse obligations of the Local Limited Partnership;  
   
 the general partner is authorized to borrow funds on behalf of the Local Limited Partnership; and 
   
 the Partnership, as a limited partner in the Local Limited Partnership, does not have the ability to direct or otherwise significantly influence the activities of the Local Limited Partnership that most significantly impact such entity s economic performance. 
   
 The one VIE at September 30, 2016 consisted of a Local Limited Partnership that was directly engaged in the ownership and management of one apartment property with a total of 48 units.  The Partnership is involved with the VIE as a non-controlling limited partner equity holder. The Partnership s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the unconsolidated VIE is limited to the Partnership s recorded investment in and receivables from this VIE, which was zero at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Partnership may be subject to additional losses to the extent of any financial support that the Partnership voluntarily provides in the future .   
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions. Judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the Partnership s accounting policies in many areas. The Partnership believes that of its critical accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity: 
   
 Method of Accounting for Investments in Local Limited Partnership 
   
 The Partnership, as a limited partner, does not have a contractual relationship with the Local Limited Partnership or exercise control over the activities and operations, including refinancing or selling decisions, of the Local Limited Partnership that would require or allow for consolidation. Accordingly, the Partnership accounts for its investment in the Local Limited Partnership using the equity method. The Partnership is allocated profits and losses of the Local Limited Partnership based upon its ownership percentage (99%). Distributions of surplus cash from operations from the Local Limited Partnership are restricted by the Local Limited Partnership's Regulatory Agreements with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) and/or are restricted by the terms of the mortgages encumbering the Project. These restrictions limit the distribution to a portion, generally less than 10%, of the initial invested capital. The excess surplus cash is deposited into a residual receipts reserve, of which the ultimate realization by the Partnership is uncertain as HUD frequently retains such reserve upon sale or dissolution of any Local Limited Partnership. The Partnership is allocated profits and losses and receives distributions from refinancings and sales in accordance with the Local Limited Partnership's partnership agreement. This agreement limits the Partnership s distributions to an amount substantially less than its ownership percentage in the Local Limited Partnership.  

14 

The investment is carried at cost plus the Partnership s share of the Local Limited Partnership s profits less the Partnership s share of the Local Limited Partnership s losses, distributions and impairment charges. The Partnership is not legally liable for the obligations of the Local Limited Partnership and is not otherwise committed to provide additional support to it. Therefore, it does not recognize losses once its investment in the Local Limited Partnership reaches zero. Distributions from the Local Limited Partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance until the investment balance is reduced to zero. When the investment balance has been reduced to zero, subsequent distributions received are recognized as income in the statements of operations. 
   
 For those investments where the Partnership has determined that the carrying value of its investments approximates the estimated fair value of those investments, the Partnership s policy is to recognize equity in income of the Local Limited Partnership only to the extent of distributions received and amortization of acquisition costs from the Local Limited Partnership.  Therefore, the Partnership limits its recognition of equity earnings to the amount it expects to ultimately realize.

  (a)  
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   
   
 The Partnership s management, with the participation of the Senior Managing Director and SVP of Finance/CFO of Bethesda, who are the equivalent of the Partnership s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation the Senior Managing Director and SVP of Finance/CFO of Bethesda, who are the equivalent of the Partnership s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were designed and were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Senior Managing Director and SVP of Finance/CFO of Bethesda, who are the equivalent of the Partnership s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
   
  (b)  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   
   
 There has been no change in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
