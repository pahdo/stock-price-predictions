 Description of Business    

 Antares Pharma, Inc. ( Antares  or the  Company ) is an emerging, specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of self-administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies.  The Company has multiple internal product development programs as well as numerous partnership arrangements with several industry leading pharmaceutical companies. The Company has formed strategic alliances with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. ( Teva ), Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Ferring B.V. (together  Ferring ), JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. ( JCR ) and AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( AMAG ).  Through these relationships, the Company develops and applies its drug delivery systems in collaborations with the pharmaceutical partners to enhance the partners' drug compounds and delivery methods. 
 The Company develops and manufactures, for itself and with its partners, novel, pressure-assisted injector devices, with and without needles, which allow patients to self-inject drugs. It makes a reusable, needle-free spring action injection device which is marketed through its partners for use with human growth hormone ( hGH ).  The Company has also developed variations of the needle-free injector by adding a small shielded needle to a pre-filled, single-use disposable injector, called the VIBEX    pressure assisted auto injection system. This system is an alternative to the needle-free system for use with injectable drugs in unit dose containers and is suitable for branded and generic injectables.  Additionally, the Company developed a disposable multi-dose pen injector for use with standard cartridges, and has two gel-based products which are commercialized through partners. 
 In February 2014, the Company launched its proprietary product OTREXUP  (methotrexate) injection, which is the first subcutaneous methotrexate for once weekly self-administration with an easy-to-use, single dose, disposable auto injector approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ).  OTREXUP  is indicated for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis, children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adults with severe recalcitrant psoriasis.   
 In December 2015, the Company received FDA approval for an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) for 4 mg/0.5 mL and 6 mg/0.5 mL Sumatriptan Injection USP in adults for the acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache. Sumatriptan Injection USP is the Company s first ANDA approval of a complex generic and second product approved using the VIBEX    auto injector platform. The Company previously entered into a license, supply and development agreement with Teva pursuant to which Teva is responsible for the commercialization of the sumatriptan product, and in June 2016, the Company and Teva announced the launch of the generic equivalent to Imitrex    (sumatriptan succinate) injection, 4 mg and 6 mg single-dose prefilled syringe auto-injectors in the U.S. 
 Antares also has a pipeline of proprietary and partnered products at various stages of development.  The Company completed  clinical studies of VIBEX    QuickShot    Testosterone for testosterone replacement therapy in the third quarter of 2016 and is working toward the submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA by December 31, 2016.   In addition, the Company is working with Teva on the development and approval of an auto-injector containing epinephrine and two pen injector products, which are all currently under FDA review.

 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies    

 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
 Investments 
 All investments are U.S. Treasury bills or U.S. Treasury notes that are classified as held-to-maturity because of the Company s positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. The securities are carried at their amortized cost and the fair value of all securities is determined by quoted market prices.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had investments with a carrying value of $3,001,312 and $15,012,225, respectively.  The fair value of the Company s investments approximated their carrying value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Inventories  
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Certain components of the Company s products are provided by a limited number of vendors, and the Company s production, assembly, warehousing and distribution operations are outsourced to third-parties where substantially all of the Company s inventory is located.  Disruption of supply from key vendors or third-party suppliers may have a material adverse impact on the Company s operations.  The Company provides a reserve for potentially excess, dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand compared to forecasts of future sales, which was $900,000 and $800,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Inventories consist of the following: 

OTREXUP TM  Revenue Recognition 
 In February 2014, the Company began detailing OTREXUP  to health care professionals. OTREXUP  is sold in a package of four pre-filled, single-dose disposable auto injectors to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, its customers, subject to rights of return within a period beginning six months prior to, and ending 12 months following, product expiration.  Given the limited sales history of OTREXUP , the Company currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment. Accordingly, recognition of revenue is deferred on product shipments of OTREXUP  until the right of return no longer exists, which occurs at the earlier of the time OTREXUP  units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return. Units dispensed are generally not subject to return, except in the rare cases where the product malfunctions or the product is damaged in transit. Patient prescriptions dispensed are estimated using third-party market prescription data.  These third-party sources poll pharmacies, hospitals, mail order and other retail outlets for OTREXUP  prescriptions and project this sample on a national level. The Company uses this third party prescription data, among other information, as a basis for revenue recognition in each reporting period.  If patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period are underestimated or overestimated, adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods. 
 The Company will continue to recognize revenue upon the earlier to occur of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until it can reliably estimate product returns, at which time the Company may record a one-time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred. In addition, the costs of manufacturing OTREXUP  associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs, which are included in inventory, until such time as the related deferred revenue is recognized. 
 The Company recognized $3,904,329 and $11,024,394 in OTREXUP  product sales revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $3,592,779 and $9,943,182 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which is presented net of product sales allowances for estimated wholesaler discounts, prompt pay discounts, chargebacks, rebates and patient discount programs. The Company had deferred revenue balances of $1,154,112 and $1,064,874 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for OTREXUP  product shipments, which is net of product sales allowances, discussed below. 
 Product Sales Allowances 
 The Company recognizes product sales allowances as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Product sales allowances are based on amounts owed or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration the terms of our agreements with customers and third-party payors and the levels of inventory within the distribution channels that may result in future rebates or discounts taken. In certain cases, such as patient support programs, the Company recognizes the cost of patient discounts as a reduction of revenue based on estimated utilization. If actual future results vary, it may be necessary to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on product revenue in the period of adjustment. Product sales allowances include: 
 Wholesaler Distribution Fees . Distribution fees are paid to certain wholesale distributors based on contractually determined rates. The Company accrues the fee on shipment to the respective wholesale distributors and recognizes the fee as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  
 8 

Prompt Pay Discounts  . The Company offers cash discounts to its customers, generally 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for p  rompt payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the prompt pay discount amount and recognizes the discount as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  
 Chargebacks . The Company provides discounts to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule ( FSS ) of the General Services Administration under an FSS contract negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and various organizations under Medicaid contracts and regulations. These entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at a discounted price, and the wholesale distributors then charge back to the Company the difference between the current wholesale acquisition cost and the price the entity paid for the product. The Company estimates and accrues chargebacks based on estimated wholesaler inventory levels, current contract prices and historical chargeback activity. Chargebacks are recognized as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  
 Rebates . The Company participates in certain rebate programs, which provide discounted prescriptions to qualified insured patients.  Under these rebate programs, the Company will pay a rebate to the third-party administrator of the program, generally two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled. The Company estimates and accrues for these rebates based on current contract prices, historical and estimated percentages of product sold to qualified patients.  Rebates are recognized as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  
 Patient Discount Programs . The Company offers discount card programs to patients for OTREXUP  in which patients receive discounts on their prescriptions that are reimbursed by the Company. The Company estimates the total amount that will be redeemed based on historical redemption experience and on levels of inventory in the distribution and retail channels and recognizes the discount as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  
 Revenue Recognition   Sumatriptan 
 Under a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva for an auto-injector product containing sumatriptan, the Company produces devices and assembles final product for shipment to Teva, and Teva is responsible for commercial distribution of the product.  The Company is compensated, and recognizes revenue, at cost for shipments of product delivered to Teva.  The Company is also entitled to receive 50 percent of the future net profits from commercial sales made by Teva.  Revenues from the profit sharing arrangement will be recognized in future periods when amounts are fixed and determinable and are payable to the Company within 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter in which commercial sales are made.

 Stockholders  Equity    

 The Company s Board of Directors unanimously approved, and recommended to the stockholders to approve and adopt, an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from 203,000,000 to 303,000,000 in order to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company from 200,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares.  The amendment was approved and adopted by a vote of the stockholders at the Company s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 2, 2016. 

4  .   
 
 Share-Based Compensation    

 The Company s 2008 Equity Compensation Plan (the  Plan ) was amended and restated pursuant to stockholder approval on June 2, 2016 in order to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan, extend the term of the Plan, impose a one-year minimum vesting requirement and provide for double trigger vesting for certain awards in the event of a change in control.  The Plan allows for grants in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock units, stock awards, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards.  All of the Company s officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisors are eligible to receive grants under the Plan.  The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the amended and restated Plan is 32,200,000 and the maximum number of shares of stock that may be granted to any one employee for qualified performance-based compensation during a calendar year is 4,000,000 shares.  Options to purchase shares of common stock are granted at exercise prices not less than 100% of fair market value on the dates of grant.  The term of each option is ten years and the options typically vest in quarterly installments over a three-year period with a minimum vesting period of one year.  As of September 30, 2016 the Plan had approximately 8,900,000 shares available for grant. 
 9 

Stock Options  
 The following is a summary of stock option activity under the Plan as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:    

The per share weighted average fair values of all options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were estimated as $0.54 and $1.13, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below.  Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock price.  The weighted average expected life is based on both historical and anticipated employee behavior. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, stock option exercises resulted in proceeds of $24,071 and the issuance of 21,492 shares of common stock.  No stock options were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 The Company recognized $1,572,710 and $2,177,067 in compensation expense related to stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and stock compensation expense of $505,663 and $766,062 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $2,300,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested outstanding stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years. 
 Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP) 
 The Company s Board of Directors has approved a long term incentive program ( LTIP ) for the benefit of the Company s senior executives.  Pursuant to the LTIP, the Company s senior executives have been awarded stock options, restricted stock units ( RSU ) and performance stock units ( PSU ) with targeted values based on values granted to similarly situated senior executives in the Company s peer group. 
 The stock options have a ten-year term, have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, vest in quarterly installments over three years, were otherwise granted on the same standard terms and conditions as other stock options granted pursuant to the Plan and are included in the stock options table above. The RSUs vest in three equal annual installments.  The PSU awards made to the senior executives vest and convert into shares of the Company s common stock based on the Company s attainment of certain performance goals as established by the Company s Board of Directors over a performance period, which is typically three to five years.  
 10 

The performance stock unit awards and restricted stock unit awards granted under the long term incentive program are s  ummarized in the following table:  

In 2016 and 2015, the LTIP awards include PSUs that may be earned based on the Company s total shareholder return ( TSR ) relative to the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ( NBI ) at the end of the performance period, which performance period is January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 for the 2015 award and January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 for the 2016 award.  Depending on the outcome of the performance goal, a recipient may ultimately earn a number of shares greater or less than the target number of shares granted, ranging from 0% to 150% of the PSUs granted. The fair values of the TSR PSUs granted in June 2016 and May 2015 was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and utilized the following inputs and assumptions:  

The performance period starting price is measured as the average closing price over the last 20 trading days prior to the performance period start. The Monte Carlo simulation model also assumed correlations of returns of the prices of the Company s common stock and the common stocks of the NBI companies and stock price volatilities of the NBI companies.  The fair value of the target number of shares that can be earned under the TSR PSUs is being recognized as compensation expense over the performance period. 
 Total compensation expense recognized in connection with PSU awards was $11,331 and $89,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Compensation expense recognized in connection with RSU awards was $302,782 and $382,084 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Some of the shares issued in connection with RSU awards that vested in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees  minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations were 65,575 and 39,665 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were based on the fair value of the shares on their vesting date as determined by the Company s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees  tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $64,096 and $87,770 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.

      Significant Customers and Concentrations of Risk     

 Revenues by customer location are summarized as follows: 

Significant customers from which the Company derived 10% or more of total revenue are as follows: 

(1)   
 
 Represents estimated revenue based on OTREXUP  shipments, a portion of which has not been recognized as revenue but is recorded in deferred revenue at the end of each period as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    

(2)   
 
 The licensing agreement with LEO Pharma A/S was terminated effective June 23, 2015 and accordingly no revenue was recognized or received from this customer for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

6  .   
 
 Net Loss Per Share    

 Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per common share reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of securities into common stock.  Potentially dilutive stock options excluded from dilutive loss per share because their effect was anti-dilutive totaled 11,810,212 and 9,571,079 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases , which is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined). ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.  Upon adoption, the lessee will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , as part of its simplification initiative. The areas of simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the standard will have on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08  Principal Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  and in April 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  These updates amend, clarify and provide implementation guidance on the new revenue recognition standard ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contract with Customers , which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of these standards will have on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

 Overview 
 Company and Product Overview 
 Antares Pharma, Inc. ( Antares,   we,   our,   us  or the  Company ) is an emerging, specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing self-administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies.  We have multiple internal product development programs as well as numerous partnership arrangements with several industry leading pharmaceutical companies. We have formed strategic alliances with Teva, Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Ferring B.V. (together  Ferring ), JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. ( JCR ) and AMAG.  We develop and apply our drug delivery systems in collaborations with these pharmaceutical partners to enhance our partners' drug compounds and delivery methods. 
 We develop and manufacture for ourselves and with partners, novel, pressure-assisted injectors, with and without needles, which allow patients to self-inject drugs.  We make a reusable, needle-free spring action injection device that is marketed through our partners for use with human growth hormone ( hGH) .  We have developed variations of the needle-free injector by adding a small shielded needle to a pre-filled, single-use disposable injector, called the VIBEX    pressure assisted auto injection system. This system is an alternative to the needle-free system for use with injectable drugs in unit dose containers and is suitable for branded and generic injectables.  Additionally, we have developed a disposable multi-dose pen injector for use with standard cartridges, and have two gel-based products that are commercialized through partners. 
 We launched our product OTREXUP , which is the first FDA approved subcutaneous methotrexate for once weekly self-administration with an easy-to-use, single dose, disposable auto injector, in February 2014.  OTREXUP  is indicated for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis, children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adults with severe recalcitrant psoriasis.   To date, we have received FDA approval for eight dosage strengths of OTREXUP  (7.5 mg,10 mg, 12.5 mg, 15 mg, 17.5 mg, 20 mg, 22.5 mg and 25 mg).   
 In December 2015, the FDA approved our Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for 4 mg/0.5 mL and 6 mg/0.5 mL Sumatriptan Injection USP, indicated for adults for the acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache.  Sumatriptan Injection USP represents the Company s first ANDA approval of a complex generic and second product approved using the VIBEX    auto injector platform.  Under the terms of a license, supply and distribution arrangement, the VIBEX    Sumatriptan product will be distributed by Teva.  We and our partner Teva announced the launch of the generic equivalent to Imitrex  (sumatriptan succinate) injection, 4 mg and 6 mg single-dose prefilled syringe auto-injectors in the U.S. in June 2016.

Overview of Clinical, Regulatory and Product Development Activities  
 We are developing QuickShot    Testosterone for testosterone replacement therapy.  We previously announced positive top-line pharmacokinetic results that showed that the primary endpoint was achieved in our ongoing, multi-center, phase 3 clinical study (QST-13-003) evaluating the efficacy and safety of testosterone enanthate administered once-weekly by subcutaneous injection using the QuickShot    auto injector in testosterone deficient adult males.  In October 2015, we announced that the last patient in study QST-13-003 received their week 52 treatment, which marked the end of the treatment and follow up phase of this study, and in March 2016, we announced the results of the 52 week safety follow-up for the QST-13-003 trial. Based upon a written response we received from the FDA related to our clinical development program for QST, we conducted an additional study, QST-15-005, to support the filing of our expected 505 (b) (2) New Drug Application ( NDA ) for QST.  The study included a screening phase, a treatment titration phase and a treatment phase for evaluation of safety and tolerability assessments, including laboratory assessments, adverse events and injection site assessments.  We completed enrollment in study QST-15-005 in October 2015 and announced on June 1, 2016 that the last patient had completed their treatment under the 26-week safety and pharmacokinetic phase 3 study. In September 2016, we announced the completion and results of the supplement study QST-15-005, signifying the conclusion of our clinical work necessary to begin the NDA submission process with the FDA. We expect to file the NDA for QST by December 31, 2016. 
 We are collaborating with Teva on a combination product development project for a VIBEX    auto injector pen containing epinephrine, used for the treatment of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).  Teva submitted an amendment to the VIBEX    epinephrine pen ANDA in December 2014 and received a Complete Response Letter ( CRL ) from the FDA on February 23, 2016 in which, according to Teva, the FDA identified certain major deficiencies.  Teva is evaluating the CRL and intends to submit a response. However, due to the major deficiencies identified in the CRL, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from their previously anticipated launch date in the second half of 2016 and that any launch will not take place before 2017. 
 Our other combination product development projects in collaboration with Teva include an exenatide multi-dose pen for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and another multi-dose pen for a generic form of Forteo    (teriparatide [rDNA origin] injection) for the treatment of osteoporosis. Teva filed an ANDA for exenatide, which was accepted by the FDA in October 2014 and is currently under FDA review.  We recently announced that Teva had settled the patent litigation with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, AstraZeneca AB, and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC (collectively  AstraZeneca ), relating to certain AstraZeneca U.S. patents and their drug, BYETTA    (exenatide).  AstraZeneca and Teva entered into a settlement and license agreement pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted Teva a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of BYETTA    described in Teva s ANDA.  The settlement allows Teva to commercialize their exenatide product in the U.S. beginning October 15, 2017 or earlier under certain circumstances. Teva also filed an ANDA for a generic version of Forteo    (teriparatide [rDNA origin] injection), which was accepted by the FDA and is currently under review.  In response to Teva s paragraph IV certification contained in Teva s ANDA for teriparatide, Eli Lilly and Company ( Lilly ) filed a lawsuit against Teva alleging infringement of six U.S. patents related to Forteo    (teriparatide [rDNA origin] injection) resulting in a 30-month stay in FDA approval of the ANDA.  The stay will expire in August 2018 unless the litigation is resolved sooner. 
 In partnership with AMAG, we are currently developing a variation of our VIBEX    QuickShot    auto injector for use with AMAG s progestin hormone drug   Makena    (hydroxy-progesterone caproate injection) for the prevention of pre-term labor in pregnant women.  Under a license, development and supply agreement, AMAG is responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications, manufacturing and supplying the drug, and marketing, selling and distributing the final product.  We are responsible for the design and development of the auto-injection device, manufacturing and supplying the device, and assembly and packaging of the final product.   
 Results of Operations 
 We reported net losses of $6,120,983 and $19,838,556 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively as compared to net losses of $5,738,041 and $14,032,361 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  The following is an analysis and discussion of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015. 
 15 

Revenues  

Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $13,478,763 and $11,085,752, respectively.  Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $38,025,925 as compared to $33,854,180 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The following is a detailed discussion of the components of and changes in revenue. 
 OTREXUP  
 We sell OTREXUP  in a package of four pre-filled, single-dose disposable auto injectors to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, our customers.  Sales to our customers are subject to specified rights of return. We currently defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of OTREXUP  to our customers until the right of return no longer exists, which occurs at the earlier of the time OTREXUP  units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return. Patient prescriptions dispensed are estimated using third-party market prescription data.  These third-party sources poll pharmacies, hospitals, mail order and other retail outlets for OTREXUP  prescriptions and project this sample on a national level.  We use this third party prescription data, among other information, as a basis for revenue recognition in each reporting period. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenue of $3,904,329 and $3,592,779, respectively, from OTREXUP  sales, which is presented net of product sales allowances for estimated wholesaler discounts, prompt pay discounts, chargebacks, rebates and patient discount programs.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenue from OTREXUP  sales of $11,024,394 and $9,943,182, respectively. Sales of OTREXUP  increased by $311,550, or 9%, and $1,081,212 or 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared with sales in the same periods in 2015.  We believe the growth in sales and revenue recognized in each of the periods presented is a result of an increase in, and broadening of, our marketing efforts. 
 We had deferred revenue of $1,154,112 and $1,064,874 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for OTREXUP  product shipments to wholesalers, which is net of product sales allowances. We will continue to recognize revenue upon the earlier to occur of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until we can reliably estimate product returns, at which time we may record a one-time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred. 
 Auto injector and pen injector devices 
 We recognize revenue from shipments of auto injector and pen injector devices to our partner/customers Teva and AMAG.  Product sales of auto injector and pen injector devices were $5,943,786 and $3,240,437 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an overall increase of 83% on a year over year basis.  This increase is primarily due to the sale of approximately $3.4 million in sumatriptan injection drug/device combination product to Teva and $1.4 million in device sales to AMAG, offset by a decrease in pre-launch epinephrine device sales during the third quarter of 2016 versus 2015. In June 2016, we announced the launch of the generic equivalent of Imitrex    (sumatriptan succinate) injection in the U.S. with Teva.  Under a license, supply and distribution agreement, we produce the devices and assemble the final combination product, and Teva is responsible for distribution of the product.  We are compensated at cost for shipments of product to Teva and are entitled to receive 50 percent of the future net profits from commercial sales made by Teva.  There were no profit sharing revenues recognized on shipments of sumatriptan product during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Revenues from the profit sharing arrangement, if any, will be recognized in future periods, likely beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, when amounts are fixed and determinable and will be payable to us within 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter in which commercial sales are made.   
 Sales from auto injector and pen injector devices were $15,836,179 and $5,207,463 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant increase in auto injector sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as  
 16 

compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 is attributable to approximately $6.4 million in year to date shipments of sumatriptan product   to Teva, $1.4 million in device sales to AMAG, and a $3.0 million increase in sales of pre-launch quantities of auto injector devices sold to Teva for use with their generic epinephrine product, which is currently under FDA review, in anticipation of a pot  ential launch.  However, as discussed above, Teva received a CRL from the FDA citing certain major deficiencies related to its ANDA for its epinephrine product.  As a result, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from thei  r previously anticipated launch date in the second   half of 2016 and that any launch will not take place before 2017  .  Accordingly, this delay may impact our future sales of epinephrine devices to Teva.  The trend in increased revenue from auto injector dev  ices may not be sustained, and may not be indicative of revenues in future quarters or for the year ending December 31, 2016.   
 Needle-free injector devices and components 
 Our revenue from reusable needle-free injector devices and disposable components was $1,201,725 and $1,193,813 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3,720,316 and $3,339,548 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These revenues are generated primarily from sales to Ferring, which sells our needle-free injector with 4 mg and 10 mg hGH formulations in Europe and Asia.  We do not control our partners  sales volume or inventory levels of our injectors and components, which can cause fluctuations in our product sales in comparative periods. 
 Development revenue 
 Development revenue typically represents amounts earned under arrangements with partners for which we develop new products on their behalf.  Frequently, we receive up-front and milestone payments from our partners that are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over a development period or upon completion of defined deliverables.  Development revenue was $2,101,203 and $2,608,336 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6,466,974 and $8,024,184 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease in development revenue recognized for the comparative three and nine month periods was primarily a result of a reduction in development activities with Teva in connection with the epinephrine auto injector, which is currently under FDA review, offset by increases in development activities with Teva for the exenatide and teriparatide pen injector products and with AMAG for the Makena    auto injector. 
 Licensing Revenue 
 Licensing revenue represents amounts received from partners for the right to use certain intellectual property.  Generally, the up-front or milestone payments received are initially deferred and recognized in revenue over the license period. We recognized $38,618 and $42,960 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $128,040 and $6,112,341 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The licensing revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was principally attributable to our license and promotion agreement with LEO Pharma A/S ( LEO ), which was terminated effective June 23, 2015.  The upfront and milestone payments received from LEO totaling $10.0 million were being recognized into revenue over a 35-month period.  As a result of the termination of the agreement, we recognized the remaining unamortized balance of the deferred revenue in the second quarter of 2015.  No additional revenue related to this arrangement has been or is expected to be recognized in subsequent or future periods, which resulted in the decrease in licensing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 
 Royalties 
 Royalty revenue was $289,102 and $407,427 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $850,022 and $1,227,462 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We receive royalties from Ferring related to needle-free injector device sales, from Meda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on sales of Elestrin    and from Actavis plc on sales of Gelnique   .   
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 The following table summarizes our total cost of revenue and gross profit: 

17 

Our gross profit was $5,445,042 and $15,898,365 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively as compared to $5,985,989 and $20,371,594 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The decrease in our gross profit for the nine-month comparative period ended September 30, 2016 is principally attributable to the termination of the LEO agreement in the second quarter of 2015, during which we recognized the remaining balance of the deferred revenue received under the agreement of approximately $5.1 million, which had no associated cost.  In addition, product sales recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include approximately $3.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, in generic sumatriptan injection product sold to Teva at cost, for which profit sharing will be recognized in future periods following commercial sale by Teva.  The sumatriptan sales in 2016, for which no margin has yet been recognized, was the primary cause of the lower gross profit percentage for the three-month comparative period ended September 30, 2016.  Other variations in revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit are attributable to our development activities, which fluctuate depending on the mix of development projects in progress and stages of completion in each period, as discussed in more detail below. 
 The following table summarizes the revenue, cost of sales and gross margin associated with our product sales: 

The cost of product sales includes product acquisition costs from third-party manufacturers and internal manufacturing overhead expenses. The product gross profit decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the $3.4 million sales of sumatriptan product to Teva during the quarter, for which no margin has yet been recognized. The increase in product gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 was principally a result of the overall increase in product sales for the comparative nine month periods, as discussed above. The reduction in our product gross margin percentage was caused primarily by the sale of approximately $3.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of generic sumatriptan product at cost with no corresponding gross margin to be recognized until commercial sales are made by Teva and our portion of profit margin is calculated and paid to us in future periods.  Our profit sharing arrangement with Teva for generic sumatriptan injection may create fluctuation in revenues and cost of sales recognized in a given period depending upon the timing of product shipments to Teva and the subsequent commercial sales by Teva into the distribution channel. 
 The cost of development revenue consists primarily of direct external costs, some of which may have been previously incurred and deferred.  The cost of development revenue in each period was primarily related to revenue recognized under the Teva auto injector and pen injector programs.  Development gross profits can vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of development projects in progress and stages of completion in each period. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist of external costs for clinical studies and analysis activities, design work and prototype development, FDA fees, personnel costs and other general operating expenses associated with research and development.  Research and development expenses were $5,958,550 and $5,142,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $15,554,599 and $14,089,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The costs primarily relate to external expenses.  The increase in research and development costs on a quarter and year to date comparative basis was mainly attributable to an overall increase in personnel costs and FDA fees.  In addition, the increase for the quarterly period was attributable to additional external costs incurred in connection with the development of QST for testosterone replacement therapy. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $5,622,937 and $6,611,169 for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $20,240,635 and $20,253,489 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The net decrease was attributable to a reduction in litigation fees, which were incurred in the prior year in connection with litigation settled in early 2015, and a reduction in personnel costs and share-based compensation in connection with the departures of our former CEO and CFO in 2016, offset by an increase in personnel costs associated with the growth in our sales force. 
 18 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 At September 30, 2016, our cash and investments totaled $31,782,739, which consisted of $28,781,427 in cash and $3,001,312 in short-term investments.  All investments are U.S. Treasury bills or U.S. Treasury notes which we intend to hold to maturity. 
 We believe that the combination of our current cash and investments balances and projected product sales, product development revenues, milestone payments and royalties will provide us with sufficient funds to support operations.  We do not currently have any bank credit lines.  If in the future we do not turn profitable or generate cash from operations as anticipated and additional capital is needed to support operations, we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources.  We may be unable to obtain such financing, or obtain it on favorable terms, in which case we may be required to curtail development of new products, limit expansion of operations or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as we may desire. 
 Cash Flows 
 Net Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Operating cash inflows are generated primarily from product sales, license and development fees and royalties.  Operating cash outflows consist principally of expenditures for manufacturing costs, personnel costs, general and administrative costs, research and development projects including clinical studies, and sales and marketing activities. Fluctuations in cash used in operating activities are primarily a result of the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Net cash used in operating activities was $11,696,233 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $25,850,595 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in cash used in operating activities in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a growth in accounts payable as of September 30, 2016, which conserved cash, as compared to greater cash used to pay down accounts payable and accrued expenses during the first nine months of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by our net loss, adjusted for non-cash operating costs plus increases in accounts receivable, inventories and deferred costs, offset by the growth in our accounts payable and deferred revenue.  
 Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,617,569 as compared to net cash used in investing activities $15,059,050 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The net cash inflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was attributable to maturities of investment securities of $12,000,000, offset by payments for capital expenditures and patent acquisition costs.   The net cash outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included the purchase of $15,037,675 in investments with proceeds from our common stock offering in May 2015, capital expenditures and payment of patent legal defense costs related to litigation settled in 2015, offset by maturities of investment securities of $6,000,000.  
 Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was $40,025 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and was related to proceeds from the exercise of stock options, less amounts withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities for an employee s minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and employment taxes in connection with the net settlement of restricted stock awards that vested. Net cash provided by financing activities was $42,762,907 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and was principally attributable to the receipt of net cash proceeds of $42,850,677 from the offering and sale of our common stock in May 2015. 
 Research and Development Programs 
 We conduct clinical, regulatory, formulation development, parenteral device development and commercial development activities for internal and partnered products.  The following is a discussion of our significant research and development programs. 
 VIBEX    QuickShot    Testosterone ( QST ).     We are developing QST for self-administered weekly injections of testosterone enanthate in a preservative free formulation for men requiring testosterone replacement.    
 On December 5, 2012, we conducted a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug application) meeting with the FDA as part of preparing to initiate clinical development of QST, establishing an agreed upon clinical path forward.  In September 2013, we announced that the first patients were dosed in a clinical study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of testosterone enanthate administered weekly by subcutaneous injection at doses of 50 mg and 100 mg via the QST auto injector device in adult males with testosterone deficiency. The study enrolled 39 patients at nine investigative sites in the U.S.  We announced our top-line results of this study on February 20, 2014.  The results are considered positive in that QST treatment resulted in most patients achieving average levels of testosterone within the normal range from the first dose onward.  QST was also safe and well-tolerated by all dosed patients. 
 19 

On November 3, 2014, we announced that the last patient has been enrolled in a double-blind, multiple-dose, phase 3 study (QST-13-003) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QST administered subcutaneously once each week to testosterone-de  ficient adult males.  Patients enrolled in this study had a documented diagnosis of hypogonadism or testosterone deficiency defined as having testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL.  The study included a screening phase, a treatment titration and efficacy pha  se and an extended treatment phase.  One hundred fifty patients were enrolled in this study.  Patients meeting all eligibility criteria were assigned to receive a starting dose of QST once weekly for six weeks.  Adjustments to dose could be made at week se  ven based upon the week six pre-dose blood level.  The efficacy of QST and dose adjustment to regulate testosterone levels were evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment.  
 On February 25, 2015, we announced positive top-line pharmacokinetic results that showed that the primary endpoint was achieved in QST-13-003.   The protocol for the study required that at the week 12 endpoint: (i) at least 75% of all patients  C avg  are within the normal range of 300 to 1100 ng/dL, with a lower limit of a 95% 2-sided confidence interval of greater than or equal to 65%, (ii) at least 85% of patients  C max  are less than1500 ng/dL and (iii) no more than 5% of patients had a C max  greater than 1800 ng/dL. The primary endpoint of the population that received one or more doses of QST was met by 139 out of 150 patients, equating to 92.7% with a 95% confidence interval of 87.3% to 96.3%.  Among the 137 patients that completed all 12 weeks of dosing and pharmacokinetic sampling, 98.5% were within the pre-defined range.  The top-line results are summarized in the table below. 

*   
 
 All patients with 1 or more doses, C avg  0-168 hours post week 12 injection or last measured concentration carried forward    

**   
 
 Patients without a C max  determination at week 12 are assigned above 1500 ng/dL    

 Overall, the regimen demonstrated a mean (  standard deviation) steady state concentration of testosterone of 553.3   127.3 ng/dL at 12 weeks. 
 Participants in the study remained on QST and were followed for an additional 40 weeks for the collection of safety data.  On March 16, 2016, we announced that the pharmacokinetic results were final and reported the results from the 52-week safety study.  The safety population, defined as patients who received at least one dose of study drug, was comprised of 150 patients.  The most common adverse reactions (incidence  5%) in this phase 3 study were increased hematocrit, hypertension, increased prostate-specific antigen, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, injection site bruising and headache. Serious adverse events (SAE s) reported included one case each of worsening depression, vertigo and suicide.  None of the SAE s were considered to be related to the study drug by the investigators, however the Company determined that the case of suicide could not be ruled out as potentially being related to study drug.  There have been no reported adverse events consistent with urticaria (hives), pulmonary oil micro embolism ( POME ), anaphylaxis or major adverse cardiovascular events in this study.  
 After we initiated study QST-13-003, but before we announced positive top-line pharmacokinetic results in February 2015, we received written recommendations from the FDA related to our clinical development program for QST.  The recommendations received were in response to various clinical, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and user study submissions that we made through November 2014.  We believe that we had already factored many of the recommendations cited in the advice letter into the protocol of the ongoing QST-13-003 study and into the protocols for planned human use studies as a result of guidance provided by the FDA at the May 2014 Type C meeting.  Based on a single reported occurrence of hives in our phase 2 study, the FDA recommended that we create a larger safety database, including approximately 350 subjects exposed to QST with approximately 200 subjects exposed for six months and approximately 100 subjects exposed for a year.  We assessed the FDA s comments in the advice letter and their impact on the timing of the filing of a NDA for QST with the FDA.  Based on the number of subjects in previous studies and in the current QST-13-003 study, we concluded that we would need additional subjects exposed to QST for six months.  The timing and design of the study to obtain the additional subjects and data required was determined based on further discussion with the FDA. We submitted our response to the FDA s written recommendations in early March 2015. 
 In May 2015, we received a written update from the FDA related to our clinical development program for QST. We believe, based on the update received from the FDA, there is an agreed upon path forward for the completion of an additional study to support the filing of a NDA for QST.  In June 2015, we finalized and submitted the protocol for the study, and in August 2015, we enrolled the first patients in the study, which is known as QST-15-005. The study included a screening phase, a treatment titration phase and a  
 20 

treatment phase for evaluation of sa  fety and tolerability assessments, including laboratory assessments, adverse events and injection site assessments.  The study was a dose-blind, multiple-dose, concentration controlled 26-week supplemental safety and pharmacokinetic study of QST.  Patients   meeting all eligibility criteria were assigned to receive 75 mg of QST once weekly for six weeks.  According to the protocol, adjustments to dose may be made at week seven based upon the week six C   trough    value.  QST was provided to clinical sites at dosag  e strengths of 100 mg, 75 mg and 50 mg to be utilized in dose titration.  
 In early November 2015, the Company announced that enrollment was complete in study QST-15-005. The safety population, defined as patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, consisted of 133 patients dosed with QST.  On June 1, 2016 we announced that the last patient had completed treatment under the 26-week safety and pharmacokinetic phase 3 study QST-15-005, and in September, 2016 we announced the results of the study. The most common adverse reactions (incidence  5%) in the QST-15-005 study were increased hematocrit, upper respiratory tract infection and injection site ecchymosis.  There were four patients with treatment emergent SAE s, which included one patient with transient visual impairment determined not to be drug related, one patient with appendicitis that was not drug related and one patient with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  The investigator attributed DVT as possibly drug related, which is consistent with known testosterone class SAE s.  The fourth patient had multiple hospitalizations related to septic arthritis and coronary artery disease, with a complicated clinical course post-angioplasty. These multiple reported events from the fourth patient were deemed not to be drug related.  There have been no reported adverse events consistent with urticaria, POME or anaphylaxis.  The safety data collected also included an assessment of pain.  Of the 965 injections assessed, pain was reported one time.  In that instance, the pain reported was classified as mild. 
 The Company believes that with the successful completion of this supplemental safety study we should be able to satisfy the FDA s recommendation for the larger safety database, as discussed above, and begin the NDA submission process.  We are presently preparing our NDA for QST for submission to the FDA and expect to file in by December 31, 2016. 
 In addition to the clinical trial program, we completed a Human Factors program to demonstrate safe and reliable at-home usability of QST.  Study populations included trained and untrained subjects, including patients, non-patient caregivers and health care providers.  The goals of the program were to optimize and document reliable and proper administration in study subjects in the setting of at-home use in order to support the approvability of the product.  
 Device Development Projects .  We, along with our pharmaceutical partners, are engaged in research and development activities related to our VIBEX    disposable pressure assisted auto injectors, our QuickShot    ( QS ) auto injectors, and our disposable pen injectors.  We have signed license agreements with Teva for our VIBEX    system for a product containing epinephrine and for our pen injector devices for a product containing exenatide and a product containing teriparatide. We also have a license, development and supply agreement with AMAG for our QS device containing Makena      indicated for reduced risk of pre-term labor. Our pressure assisted auto injectors are designed to deliver drugs by injection from single dose prefilled syringes.  The disposable pen injector device is designed to deliver drugs by injection through needles from multi-dose cartridges.  The development programs consist of determination of the device design, development of prototype tooling, production of prototype devices for testing and clinical studies, and development of commercial tooling and assembly equipment.  The following is a summary of the development stage for the three products in development with Teva and the development stage of our product with AMAG.  
 VIBEX    with Epinephrine 
 We have designed the VIBEX    device for a product containing epinephrine and have scaled up the commercial tooling and molds for this product.  From a regulatory standpoint Teva filed this product as an ANDA, and the FDA accepted the filing as such.  Currently, Teva is conducting its own development work on the drug product (epinephrine).  Teva filed an amendment to the ANDA with the FDA in December 2014.  Teva received a complete response letter on February 23, 2016 relating to its epinephrine ANDA in which, according to Teva, the FDA identified certain major deficiencies. Teva is evaluating the CRL and intends to submit a response. Due to the major deficiencies identified in the CRL, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from the previously anticipated launch date in the second half of 2016 and that any launch will not take place before 2017. 
 Teriparatide disposable pen injector 
 We have developed, produced and provided clinical supplies for a previously undisclosed pen injector product, which was referred to as  Pen 1 .  In April 2016, we disclosed that the  Pen 1  project with Teva relates to a generic form of Forteo    (teriparatide [rDNA origin] injection) ( Teriparatide ), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company ( Lilly ).  Forteo    is an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women.  Teva previously filed an ANDA for Teriparatide, which was accepted by the FDA and is currently under review.  On March 16, 2016, Lilly filed a lawsuit against Teva alleging patent infringement in response to Teva s Paragraph IV notice and filing contained in its ANDA for Teriparatide, resulting in a thirty-month stay on FDA s approval of the ANDA.  The stay will expire in August 2018 unless the litigation is resolved prior to that time.  Based on available information, we believe that Teva may be  
 21 

the "first applicant" to file an ANDA for a generic equivalent of Forteo        and, should Teva s ANDA be approved, may be entitled to 180 days of generic market exclusivity. The ANDA for Teriparatide represents the fourth ANDA for which the Company is the de  vice developer and the third drug device combination product with first-to-file status using one of our devices.   
 Exenatide disposable pen injector 
 We have designed and produced pen injectors for the exenatide pen injector product ( Exenatide ).  Teva initiated drug stability and completed the device development program and filed an ANDA with the FDA in the second half of 2013.  The ANDA was accepted by the FDA in October 2014 and is currently under FDA review.  In December 2014, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, AstraZeneca AB, and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC (collectively  AstraZeneca ) filed a lawsuit alleging patent infringement against Teva with respect to certain patents related to their generic version of BYETTA    (exenatide).  Teva settled the patent litigation with AstraZeneca and entered into a settlement and license agreement pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted Teva a license to manufacture and commercialize Teva s generic version of BYETTA    in the U.S. beginning October 15, 2017 or earlier under certain circumstances. Based on available information, we believe that Teva may be the "first applicant" to file an ANDA for Exenatide as a generic equivalent of BYETTA    and, should Teva s ANDA be approved, may be entitled to 180 days of generic market exclusivity.  
 VIBEX    QS with Makena     (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)  
 We are in the process of developing a variation of our VIBEX    QuickShot    auto injector for use with the progestin hormone drug   Makena    under a license, development and supply agreement with AMAG.  Under this arrangement, AMAG is responsible for the clinical development and preparation, and submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications.  We are responsible for the design and development of the auto-injection device.   
 Other Research and Development Costs.   In addition to our QST project and our device development projects with Teva and AMAG, we incur direct costs in connection with other research and development projects related to our technologies and indirect costs that include personnel costs, administrative and other operating costs related to managing our research and development projects.  
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, including any arrangements with any structured finance, special purpose or variable interest entities. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We have identified certain of our significant accounting policies that we consider particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position and which may require the application of a higher level of judgment by management and, as a result, are subject to an inherent level of uncertainty.  These policies are characterized as  critical accounting policies  and address revenue recognition, inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, and share-based compensation and are more fully described under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases , which is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined). ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.  Upon adoption, the lessee will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption. We are currently assessing the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , as part of its simplification initiative. The areas of simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently assessing the impact that the standard will have on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08  Principal Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  and in April 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  These updates amend, clarify and  
 22 

provide implementation guidance on the new revenue recognition standard ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contract with Customers, which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after Decembe  r 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of these standards will have on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  

Item 3.   
 
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

 Our primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the Swiss Franc to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of our subsidiaries in Switzerland are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to our Swiss subsidiaries in Swiss Francs.  In addition, we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the Euro and the U.S. dollar in connection with a licensing agreement with Ferring, under which certain products sold to Ferring and royalties are denominated in Euros.  Most of our product sales, including a portion of our product sales to Ferring, and our development and licensing fees and royalties are denominated in U.S. dollars, thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables. We do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk.  The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results for the periods ended September 30, 2016 was not material. 
 We also have limited exposure to market risk due to interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because a significant portion of our investments are in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and institutional money market funds. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal. To minimize market risk, we have in the past and, to the extent possible, will continue in the future, to hold debt securities to maturity at which time the debt security will be redeemed at its stated or face value. Due to the nature of our marketable securities, we believe that we are not exposed to any material market interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio. 

Item 4.   
 
     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  The evaluation was performed to determine whether the Company s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Exhibit 10.1 
  ANTARES PHARMA, INC.  
  EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  
 THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this   Agreement  ) is made and entered into on this 11 th  day of October, 2016, effective as of the 31st day of October 2016 (the   Effective Date  ) by and between Antares Pharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the   Company  ), and Fred Powell (the   Executive  ). 
  WITNESSETH:  
 WHEREAS, the Company desires to secure for itself the services of the Executive, and the Executive wishes to furnish such services to the Company, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the Company and the Executive, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 
 1.   Employment . 
 (a)   Term . This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and continue until the one-year anniversary thereof, unless sooner terminated by either party as hereinafter provided. In addition, this Agreement shall automatically renew for periods of one (1) year unless either party gives written notice to the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Term (as defined below) or at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of any one (1) year renewal period that the Agreement shall not be further extended. The period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date on which the term of the Executive s employment under this Agreement terminates is referred to herein as the   Term .  
 (b)   Duties . During the Term, the Executive shall be employed by the Company as the Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer with the duties, responsibilities and authority commensurate therewith. The Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer (the   CEO  ) and shall perform all duties and accept all responsibilities incident to such position as may be reasonably assigned to him by the CEO. 
   (c)   Best Efforts . During the Term, the Executive shall devote his best efforts and full time and attention to promote the business and affairs of the Company, and may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, operate, participate in the management, operations or control of, or act as an employee, officer, consultant, agent or representative of, any type of business or service (other than as an employee of the Company). It shall not be deemed a violation of the foregoing for the Executive to (i) act or serve as a director, trustee or committee member of any civic or charitable organization; (ii) manage his personal, financial and legal affairs; or (iii) serve as a director of an organization that is not a civic or charitable organization with the prior consent of the Board of Directors of the Company (the   Board  ), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, in all cases so long as such activities (described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)) are permitted under the Company s code of conduct and employment policies  

and do not materially interfere with or conflict with his obligations to the Company hereunder, including, without limitation, obligations pursuant to Section 6 below.  
 2.   Compensation . 
 (a)   Base Salary . During the Term, the Company shall pay the Executive a base salary (  Base Salary  ) at the annual rate of $345,000, which shall be paid in accordance with the Company s normal payroll practices. The Executive s Base Salary shall be subject to review, and at the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the   Compensation Committee  ), subject to increase (but not decrease) during the Term, based upon the performance of the Executive and the Company, as determined by the Compensation Committee with input from the CEO, in accordance with the Company s normal compensation and performance review policies for senior executives generally. 
 (b)   Bonus . In addition to the Executive s Base Salary, the Executive shall be eligible to receive a bonus for each calendar year during the Term, based on attainment of certain individual and corporate performance goals and targets (the   Annual Bonus  ) in accordance with the terms of the Company s Annual Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (or successor plan). The target amount of the Executive s Annual Bonus shall be 40% of Base Salary. The performance goals and targets shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in consultation with the CEO. Once determined, the applicable performance goals and targets shall be communicated to the Executive as soon as reasonably practicable following the Compensation Committee s determination of the applicable goals and targets. The actual Annual Bonus amount paid will be based upon the Compensation Committee s determination, in its sole discretion, whether and to what extent the applicable performance goals and targets have been achieved, and such amount may be more or less than the target amount, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. Any Annual Bonus earned and payable to the Executive hereunder shall be paid on or after January 1 but not later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the Annual Bonus is earned. Executive will not be eligible to receive an Annual Bonus for 2016. 
 (c)   Equity Compensation . 
 (i) On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Antares Pharma, Inc. 2008 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended from time to time (the    2008 Equity Plan  ) (or successor plan), the Executive shall be granted a stock option to purchase one hundred fifty thousand (150,000) shares of common stock of the Company, $0.01 par value (the   Stock  ) at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Stock on the date of grant, subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the 2008 Equity Plan (or a successor plan) and the Stock Option Agreement evidencing the terms and conditions of the grant. Provided that the Executive is employed by the Company on the applicable vesting date, the option shall vest in quarterly increments over the three year period commencing on the date of grant, such that 33-1/3% vests annually until the option is fully vested. 
   (ii) In addition, during the Term, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in any long-term equity incentive programs established by the Company for its senior level   

executives generally, including the 2008 Plan (or successor plan), at levels determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, commensurate with the Executive s position.  
 (d)   Vacation . During the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to vacation, holiday and sick leave at levels generally commensurate with those provided to other senior executives of the Company, in accordance with the Company s vacation, holiday and other pay-for-time-not worked policies; provided, however, that the Executive shall be entitled to not less than four (4) weeks of paid vacation each calendar year, prorated from any period of employment of less than twelve (12) months in a calendar year. Such paid time off may be carried over from year to year to the extent permitted in accordance with standard Company policy and shall be paid to the extent accrued (and to the extent not used) as of the Executive s termination of employment. 
 (e)   Employee Benefits . The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company s health, life insurance, long and short-term disability, dental, retirement, savings, flexible spending accounts and medical programs, if any, pursuant to their respective terms and conditions. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company from terminating or amending any employee benefit plan or program from time to time after the Effective Date. 
 (f)   Expense Reimbursement . During the Term, the Company shall reimburse the Executive, in accordance with the policies and practices of the Company in effect from time to time, for all reasonable and necessary business expenses and other disbursements incurred by him for or on behalf of the Company in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder upon presentation by the Executive to the Company of appropriate documentation thereof. 
 3.   Termination of Employment . 
 (a)   Termination for Cause . The Company may terminate the Executive s employment hereunder at any time for Cause (as defined below) upon written notice to the Executive (as described below), in which event all payments under this Agreement shall cease, except for any amounts earned, accrued and owing, but not yet paid under Section 2 above and any benefits accrued and due under any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company. 
 For purposes of this Agreement, the term   Cause   shall mean any of the following grounds for termination of the Executive s employment: (i) the Executive s knowing and material dishonesty or fraud committed in connection with the Executive s employment; (ii) theft, misappropriation or embezzlement by the Executive of the Company s funds; (iii) the Executive s conviction of or a plea of guilty or  nolo contendere  to any felony, a crime involving fraud or misrepresentation, or any other crime (whether or not connected with his employment) the effect of which is likely to adversely affect the Company or its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates; or (iv) a material breach by the Executive of any of the provisions or covenants set forth in this Agreement. 
 (b)   Voluntary Resignation . The Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment without Good Reason (as defined below) upon thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Company. In such event, after the effective date of such termination, no payments shall be due under this Agreement, except that the Executive shall be entitled to any amounts earned, accrued  

and owing, but not yet paid under Section 2 above and any benefits accrued and due under any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company.  
 For purposes of this Agreement,   Good Reason   shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following without the prior written consent of the Executive: (i) a material reduction in Executive s Base Salary; (ii) the Company s material breach of terms of this Agreement (which for purposes of this Agreement shall include (A) the failure of the Company to require any successor to the Company to assume the obligations of the Company to Executive under this Agreement and any other agreement between the Company and Executive then in effect or (B) the Company s reduction in the target annual bonus opportunity below forty (40%) of Base Salary for any calendar year during the Term) (for the avoidance of doubt for purposes of this clause (ii), both of the events described in subclauses (A) and (B) do not need to occur for a material breach of this Agreement to be triggered); (iii) a change in the Executive s designation of title from Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of the Company or successor entity (unless such change is to a higher title and level of responsibility) that results in a material diminution in Executive s authority, duties and responsibilities; (iv) a material change in the geographic location at which Executive must perform services that results in the relocation of Executive s principal business location to a location that is sixty (60) miles or more from Ewing, New Jersey; or (v) the Company s delivery to the Executive of a notice of its intent not to renew the Term pursuant to Section 1(a) above; provided that the Executive is willing and able to execute a new contract providing terms and conditions substantially similar to those in this Agreement and to continue providing services to the Company. 
 Notwithstanding any provision of this definition of Good Reason to the contrary, the Executive shall not have Good Reason for termination unless the Executive gives written notice of termination for Good Reason within thirty (30) days after the event giving rise to Good Reason occurs, the Company does not correct the action or failure to act that constitutes the grounds for Good Reason, as set forth in the Executive s notice of termination, within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Executive gives written notice of termination, and the Executive terminates employment within sixty (60) days after the event that constitutes Good Reason. If the Executive s resignation occurs after such time, the resignation shall be treated as a voluntary resignation other than for Good Reason and the Executive will not be entitled to severance benefits under this Agreement. 
 (c)   Termination without Cause; Resignation for Good Reason . Except as provided in Section 4(a) below, if the Executive s employment is terminated by the Company (or the surviving company following a Change of Control (as defined in Section 4(c) below)) without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, either before or after a Change of Control, the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall apply (subject to the modifications of Section 4(a) below, if applicable). The Company may terminate the Executive s employment with the Company at any time without Cause upon not less than thirty (30) days  prior written notice to the Executive. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, pay the Executive his Base Salary in lieu of any unexpired period of notice and terminate his employment immediately. Except as provided in Section 4(a) below, upon termination of the Executive  s employment by the Company under this Section 3(c) or by the Executive for Good Reason, either before or after a Change of Control, if the Executive executes and does not revoke a written release, in substantially the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A , of any and all claims against the Company and all related parties  

with respect to all matters arising out of the Executive s employment by the Company, or the termination thereof (other than claims for any entitlements under the terms of this Agreement or under any plans or programs of the Company under which the Executive has accrued and is due a benefit) (the    Release   ), and continues to comply with the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Invention Assignment Agreement (as defined in Section 6(a) below) and restrictive covenants and representations in Section 6 below, the Executive shall be entitled to receive the payments and benefits set forth in subsections 3(c)(i), (ii) and (iii), in lieu of any other payments and benefits due under any severance plan or program for employees or executives (subject to the modifications of Section 4(a) below, if applicable). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the timing of the Executive s execution of the Release, directly or indirectly, result in the Executive designating the calendar year of payment, and if a payment that is subject to execution of the Release could be made in more than one taxable year, payment shall be made in the later taxable year.  
 (i) The Company will pay to the Executive severance as follows: the rate of the Executive s Base Salary as in effect at the time of termination will be added together with the dollar value of the Executive s target Annual Bonus for the year in which termination occurs and the sum of the foregoing amounts will be divided by twelve (12) (the    Monthly Severance Amount  ). The Monthly Severance Amount will be paid each month over the twelve (12) month period following the Termination Date, less applicable tax withholding, paid in approximately equal installments beginning within the sixty (60)-day period following the date of the Executive s termination of employment and continuing on each payroll date thereafter until fully paid, in accordance with the Company s regular payroll practices. The first severance payment will include any missed payments during such sixty (60)-day period. 
 (ii) The Company will pay to the Executive a pro rata Annual Bonus for the year in which the termination of employment occurs, which shall be determined based on Executive s actual Annual Bonus earned for the year in which termination of employment occurs (if any), based on actual performance, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in which the Executive was employed by Company during the year in which the termination of employment occurs, and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365). The pro rata Annual Bonus described in this subsection 3(c)(ii) will be paid at the same time and under the same terms and conditions as bonuses are paid to other executives of the Company, on or after January 1 but not later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive s employment terminates, subject to Section 5(b) below.  
 (iii) For the twelve (12) month period following the Executive s termination of employment, provided that the Executive timely elects COBRA, the Company will reimburse the Executive for the monthly COBRA cost of continued medical and dental coverage for the Executive and, where applicable, his spouse and dependents, at the level in effect as of the date of the Executive s termination of employment, less the employee portion of the applicable premiums that the Executive would have paid had he remained employed during the such twelve (12) month period (the COBRA continuation coverage period shall run concurrently with the twelve (12) month period that the Executive is provided with medical and dental coverage under subsection 3(c)(i)). These reimbursements will commence within the sixty (60)-day period following the date of the Executive s termination of employment and will be paid on the first payroll date of each month, provided that the Executive demonstrates proof of payment of the   

applicable premiums prior to the applicable reimbursement payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s reimbursement of the monthly COBRA premiums in accordance with this subsection 3(c)(iii) shall cease immediately upon the earlier of: (A) the end of the twelve (12) month period following the Executive s termination of employment, or (B) the date that the Executive is eligible for comparable coverage with a subsequent employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to restructure the foregoing COBRA premium reimbursement arrangement in any manner necessary or appropriate to avoid fines, penalties or negative tax consequences to the Company or the Executive (including, without limitation, to avoid any penalty imposed for violation of the nondiscrimination requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the guidance issued thereunder), as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.  
 (iv) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the 2008 Equity Plan (or a successor plan) or any applicable agreement (including this Agreement), all outstanding equity grants held by the Executive immediately prior to the Executive s termination date which vest based upon the Executive s continued service over time that would have become vested during the twelve (12) month period following the Executive s termination date had the Executive remained employed during such twelve (12) month period shall accelerate, become fully vested and/or exercisable, as the case may be, as of the Executive s termination date. All outstanding equity grants held by the Executive immediately prior to the Executive s termination date which vest based upon attainment of performance criteria shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement evidencing such performance based award.  
 (v) The Executive shall also be entitled to any amounts earned, accrued and owing but not yet paid under Section 2 above and any benefits accrued and due under any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company without regard to whether the Executive does not execute or revokes the Release.  
 (d)   Death or Disability . The Executive s employment hereunder shall terminate upon the Executive s death or involuntary termination of employment by the Company on account of his Disability (as defined below), subject to the requirements of applicable law. If the Executive s employment terminates due to death or involuntary termination by the Company on account of the Executive s Disability, no payments shall be due under this Agreement, except that the Executive (or in the event of the Executive s death, the Executive s executor, legal representative, administrator or designated beneficiary, as applicable), shall be entitled to receive any amounts earned, accrued and owing but not yet paid under Section 2 above and any benefits accrued and due under any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term   Disability   shall mean such physical or mental illness or incapacity of the Executive as shall (i) prevent him from substantially performing his customary services and duties to the Company, and (ii) continue for periods aggregating more than sixty (60) days in any six (6)-month period. The Company shall determine whether there is a Disability after consultation with a qualified, independent physician. The Executive shall cooperate with the Company, including making himself reasonably available for examination by physicians at the Company s request, to determine whether or not he has incurred a Disability. The Executive s failure (other than a failure caused by the Disability) to cooperate with the Company in a determination of Disability shall be treated as the Executive s voluntary resignation from the Company without Good Reason. 

4.    Change of Control  .  
 (a)   Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason Within Sixty Days  Before or Eighteen Months Following a Change of Control . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if there is both a Change of Control and the Executive s employment is terminated without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason within sixty (60) days before or within eighteen (18) months following such Change of Control (a   CIC Termination  ), the Executive shall be entitled to (i) the payments set forth under subsection 3(c)(i), except that the Monthly Severance Amount will be multiplied by eighteen (18) months, (ii) the payment described in subsection 3(c)(ii) on the same terms and conditions described in subsection 3(c)(ii), (iii) the payments set forth under subsection 3(c)(iii), except that twelve (12) months shall be replaced with eighteen (18) months, and (iv) in lieu of the benefit described in subsection 3(c)(iv), notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the 2008 Equity Plan (or a successor plan) or any applicable agreement (including this Agreement), all outstanding equity grants held by the Executive immediately prior to the CIC Termination which vest based upon the Executive s continued service over time shall accelerate, become fully vested and/or exercisable, as the case may be, as of the date of the CIC Termination and all outstanding equity grants held by the Executive immediately prior to the CIC Termination which vest based upon attainment of performance criteria shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement evidencing such performance based award. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4(a), no amounts under this Section 4(a) will be paid or benefits under this Section 4(a) will be provided, in each case, upon a CIC Termination unless the Executive executes and does not revoke a Release and continues to comply with the covenants set forth in Section 6 below and the provisions of any confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation or invention assignment agreement with the Company to which the Executive is subject. 
 (b)   Application of Section 2800 . In the event that it shall be determined that any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the   Code  )) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a   Payment  ), would constitute an  excess parachute payment  within the meaning of section 280G of the Code, the aggregate present value of the Payments under the Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount (defined below), provided that the reduction shall be made only if the Accounting Firm (described below) determines that the reduction will provide the Executive with a greater net after-tax benefit than would no reduction. The   Reduced Amount   shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Payments under this Agreement without causing any Payment under this Agreement to be subject to the Excise Tax (defined below), determined in accordance with section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. The term   Excise Tax   means the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax. Payments under this Agreement shall be reduced on a nondiscretionary basis in such a way as to minimize the reduction in the economic value deliverable to the Executive. Where more than one payment has the same value for this purpose and they are payable at different times they will be reduced on a pro rata basis. Only amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 4(b). All determinations to be made under this Section 4(b) shall be made by an independent certified public accounting  

firm selected by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control (the    Accounting Firm   ), which shall provide its determinations and any supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within ten (10) days of the Change of Control. Any such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in performing the determinations referred to in this Section 4(b) shall be borne solely by the Company.  
 (c)   Definition of a Change of Control . For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Change of Control  shall have the same meaning ascribed to such term under the 2008 Equity Plan, as in effect on the date hereof and as it may be amended from time to time, or if the 2008 Equity Plan is no longer in effect, a successor plan thereto. 
 5.   Section 409A . 
 (a)   Compliance with Section 409A . This Agreement is intended to comply with section 409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations, or an exemption, and payments may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by section 409A, to the extent applicable. Severance benefits under the Agreement are intended to be exempt from section 409A of the Code under the  short-term deferral  exception, to the maximum extent applicable, and then under the  separation pay  exception, to the maximum extent applicable. For purposes of section 409A of the Code, all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a  separation from service  within the meaning of such term under section 409A of the Code, each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. In no event shall the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the Executive s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
 (b)   Payment Delay . Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive s separation from service with the Company, the Company has securities which are publicly traded on an established securities market and the Executive is a  specified employee  (as defined in section 409A of the Code) and it is necessary to postpone the commencement of any severance payments otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement as a result of such separation from service to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under section 409A of the Code, then the Company will postpone the commencement of the payment of any such payments hereunder (without any reduction in such payments ultimately paid or provided to the Executive) that are not otherwise exempt from section 409A of the Code, until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months following the Executive s separation  

from service with the Company. If any payments are postponed due to such requirements, such postponed amounts will be paid in a lump sum to the Executive on the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months following the Executive s separation from service with the Company. If the Executive dies during the postponement period prior to the payment of the postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the personal representative of the Executive s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive s death.  
 6.   Restrictive Covenants and Representations . 
 (a)   Confidential Information . Contemporaneously with this Agreement, the Executive executed the Company  s standard Proprietary Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, attached hereto as  Exhibit B  (the   Proprietary Information and Invention Assignment Agreement  ), all of the terms of which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference. The Executive hereby agrees that, during the Term and thereafter, the Executive shall hold in strict confidence any proprietary or Confidential Information (as defined below) related to the Company and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, except that he may disclose such information pursuant to law, court order, regulation or similar order or in accordance with Sections 6(g) and (h) below. For purposes of this Agreement, the term   Confidential Information   shall mean all information of the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (in whatever form) which is not generally known to the public, including without limitation any inventions, processes, methods of distribution, customer lists or trade secrets. The Executive hereby agrees that, upon the termination of this Agreement, he shall not take, without the prior written consent of the Company or in accordance with Sections 6(g) and (h) below, any document (in whatever form) of the Company or its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, which is of a confidential nature relating to the Company or its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, or, without limitation, relating to its or their methods of distribution, or any description of any formulas or secret processes and will return any such information (in whatever form) then in his possession. 
 (b)   Non-Competition . The Executive hereby acknowledges that during his employment with the Company, the Executive will become familiar with trade secrets and other Confidential Information concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors, and that the Executive s services will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company. Accordingly, the Executive hereby agrees that, subject to the requirements of applicable law, at any time during the Term, and for a period of twelve (12) months after the Executive s date of termination of employment for any reason except a CIC Termination, or eighteen (18) months after a CIC Termination (such twelve (12) month period or eighteen (18) month period, as applicable, shall be referred to as the   Restriction Period  ), the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services for, or in any manner engage in any business involving or related to (directly or indirectly) the research, development, marketing and/or sale or other delivery of injection devices, within any geographical area in which, as of the date of the Executive s termination of employment, the Company or its subsidiaries engage in business or demonstrably plan to engage in business (the   Business  ). It will not be considered a violation of this Section 6(b) for the Executive to be a passive owner of not more than 1% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. In addition, the restrictions contained in this section 6(b) shall not prevent the  

Executive from accepting employment following termination of employment with the Company with a large diversified organization with separate and distinct divisions that do not compete, directly or indirectly, with the Business, as long as prior to accepting such employment, the Company receives separate written assurances from the prospective employer and from the Executive, satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that Executive will not render any services, directly or indirectly, to any division or business unit that competes, directly or indirectly, with the Business. During the restrictive period set forth in the section, Executive will inform any new employer, prior to accepting employment, of the existence of this Agreement and provide such employer with a copy of this Agreement.  
 (c)   Non-Solicitation . The Executive hereby agrees that during the Term and the Restriction Period, (i) the Executive will not, directly or indirectly through another entity, induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries to leave the employ of the Company or its subsidiaries, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or its subsidiaries and any employee thereof or otherwise employ or receive the services of an individual who was an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries at any time during such Restriction Period, except any such individual whose employment has been terminated by the Company and (ii) the Executive will not induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, client, broker, licensee or other business relation of the Company or its subsidiaries to cease doing business with the Company or its subsidiaries. 
 (d)   Return of Property . Upon termination of the Executive s employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, voluntarily or involuntarily (and in all events within five (5) days of the Executive s date of termination), and at any earlier time the Company requests, the Executive will deliver to the person designated by the Company all originals and copies of all documents and property of the Company in the Executive s possession, under the Executive s control or to which the Executive may have access, including but not limited to, any office, computing or communications equipment (e.g., laptop computer, facsimile machine, printer, cellular phone, etc.) that he has had or has been using, and any business or business-related files that he has had in his possession, except as otherwise permitted in accordance with Sections 6(g) and (h) below. The Executive will not reproduce or appropriate for the Executive s own use, or for the use of others, any property, Confidential Information or Company inventions, and shall remove from any personal computing or communications equipment all information relating to the Company, except as otherwise permitted in accordance with Sections 6(g) and (h) below. 
 (e)   Non-Disparagement . The Executive agrees that the Executive will not disparage the Company, its subsidiaries and parents, and their respective Executives, directors, investors, employees, and agents, and its and their respective successors and assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators, or make any public statement reflecting negatively on the Company, its subsidiaries and parents, and their respective officers, directors, investors, employees, and agents, and its and their respective successors and assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators, to third parties, including, but not limited to, any matters relating to the operation or management of the Company, irrespective of the truthfulness or falsity of such statement, except as may otherwise be required by applicable law or compelled by process of law, except as otherwise permitted in accordance with Sections 6(g) and (h) below. The Company shall instruct the members of the Board and members of executive management not make any disparaging or negative remarks, either oral or in writing, regarding the Executive. 

(f)    Cooperation  . During the Term and thereafter, the Executive shall cooperate with the Company and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, upon the Company s reasonable request, with respect to any internal investigation or administrative, regulatory or judicial proceeding involving matters within the scope of the Executive s duties and responsibilities to the Company during the Term (including, without limitation, the Executive being available to the Company upon reasonable notice for interviews and factual investigations, appearing at the Company s reasonable request to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process, and turning over to the Company all relevant Company documents which are or may come into the Executive s possession during the Term);   provided  ,   however  , that any such request by the Company shall not be unduly burdensome or interfere with the Executive s personal schedule or ability to engage in gainful employment. In the event the Company requires the Executive s cooperation in accordance with this Section 6(f), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including travel, lodging and meals and reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by the Executive in connection with such cooperation, subject to reasonable documentation.  
 (g)   Reports to Government Entities . Nothing in this Agreement or the Proprietary Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, restricts or prohibits the Executive from initiating communications directly with, responding to any inquiries from, providing testimony before, providing Confidential Information to, reporting possible violations of law or regulation to, or from filing a claim or assisting with an investigation directly with a self-regulatory authority or a government agency or entity, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General (collectively, the   Regulators  ), or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal law or regulation. However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Executive is waiving his right to receive any individual monetary relief from the Company or any others covered by the Release of Claims resulting from such claims or conduct, regardless of whether the Executive or another party has filed them, and in the event the Executive obtains such monetary relief the Company will be entitled to an offset for the payments made pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement does not limit the Executive s right to receive an award from any Regulator that provides awards for providing information relating to a potential violation of law. The Executive does not need the prior authorization of the Company to engage in conduct protected by this paragraph, and the Executive does not need to notify the Company that the Executive has engaged in such conduct. 
 Please take notice that federal law provides criminal and civil immunity to federal and state claims for trade secret misappropriation to individuals who disclose a trade secret to their attorney, a court, or a government official in certain, confidential circumstances that are set forth at 18 U.S.C.    1833(b)(1) and 1833(b)(2), related to the reporting or investigation of a suspected violation of the law, or in connection with a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of the law. 
 (h)   Executive Representations . 
 (i) The Executive represents and warrants to the Company that there are no restrictions, agreements or understandings whatsoever to which the Executive is a party which   

would prevent or make unlawful the Executive s execution of this Agreement or the Executive s employment hereunder, which is or would be inconsistent or in conflict with this Agreement or the Executive s employment hereunder, or would prevent, limit or impair in any way the performance by the Executive of the obligations hereunder. In addition, the Executive has disclosed to the Company all restraints, confidentiality commitments, and other employment restrictions that he has with any other employer, person or entity. The Executive covenants that in connection with his provision of services to the Company, the Executive shall not breach any obligation (legal, statutory, contractual or otherwise) to any former employer or other person, including, but not limited to, obligations relating to confidentiality and proprietary rights.  
 (ii) Upon and after the Executive s termination or cessation of employment with the Company and until such time as no obligations of the Executive to the Company hereunder exist, the Executive shall (A) provide a complete copy of this Agreement to any person, entity or association engaged in a competing business with whom or which the Executive proposes to be employed, affiliated, engaged, associated or to establish any business or remunerative relationship prior to the commencement of any such relationship and (B) shall notify the Company of the name and address of any such person, entity or association prior to the commencement of such relationship.  
 7.   Legal and Equitable Remedies . Because the Executive s services are personal and unique and the Executive has had and will continue to have access to and has become and will continue to become acquainted with the proprietary information of the Company, and because any breach by the Executive of any of the restrictive covenants contained in Section 6 would result in irreparable injury and damage for which money damages would not provide an adequate remedy, the Company shall have the right to enforce Section 6 and any of its provisions by injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without bond and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach, or threatened breach, of the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 6. The Executive agrees that in any action in which the Company seeks injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, the Executive will not assert or contend that any of the provisions of Section 6 are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. The Executive irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees that any legal proceeding arising out of this paragraph may be brought in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in Mercer County, New Jersey, (b) consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such court in any such proceeding, and (c) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such proceeding in any such court. The Executive also irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the service of any process, pleadings, notices or other papers. 
 8.   Arbitration; Expenses . In the event of any dispute under the provisions of this Agreement, other than a dispute in which the primary relief sought is an equitable remedy such as an injunction, the parties shall be required to have the dispute, controversy or claim settled by arbitration in Trenton, New Jersey in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect of the American Arbitration Association, before an arbitrator agreed to by both parties. If the parties cannot agree upon the choice of arbitrator, the Company and the Executive will each choose an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will then select a third arbitrator who will serve as the actual arbitrator for the dispute, controversy or claim.

 1.   Confidentiality of this Agreement .  Executive agrees not disclose to others the fact or terms of this Agreement,  except  Executive may disclose such information to his spouse or domestic/civil union partner and to his attorney or accountant (in order for such individuals to render professional services to Executive), so long as such individuals agree to keep such information confidential. Nothing in this Section 10, or elsewhere in this Agreement, is intended to prevent or prohibit Executive from (a) providing information regarding Executive s former employment relationship with the Company, as may be required by law or legal process, or (b) cooperating, participating or assisting in any government entity investigation or proceeding. 

2.    Reports to Government Entities  .

However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Executive is waiving his right to receive any individual monetary relief from the Company or any others covered by the Release of Claims resulting from such claims or conduct, regardless of whether the Executive or another party has filed them, and in the event the Executive obtains such monetary relief the Company will be entitled to an offset for the payments made pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement does not limit the Executive s right to receive an award from any Regulator that provides awards for providing information relating to a potential violation of law. The Executive does not need the prior authorization of the Company to engage in conduct protected by this paragraph, and the Executive does not need to notify the Company that the Executive has engaged in such conduct. 
 Please take notice that federal law provides criminal and civil immunity to federal and state claims for trade secret misappropriation to individuals who disclose a trade secret to their attorney, a court, or a government official in certain, confidential circumstances that are set forth at 18 U.S.C.    1833(b)(1) and 1833(b)(2), related to the reporting or investigation of a suspected violation of the law, or in connection with a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of the law. 
 (b) Executive recognizes and agrees that, in connection with any such activity outlined above, Executive must inform the Regulators, Executive s attorney, a court or a government official that the information Executive is providing is confidential. Despite the foregoing, Executive is not permitted to reveal to any third-party, including any governmental, law enforcement, or regulatory authority, information Executive came to learn during the course of Executive s employment with the Company that is protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to the attorney-client privilege and/or attorney work product doctrine. The Company does not waive any applicable privileges or the right to continue to protect its privileged attorney-client information, attorney work product, and other privileged information.

signatures of Executive and the Company. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including facsimile counterparts or as a  pdf  or similar attachment to an email), each of which shall be deemed to be an original as against any party whose signature appears thereon, but all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.  
 5.   Severability .  If any provision of this Agreement or application thereof to anyone or under any circumstances is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or application of this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid or unenforceable provision or application and shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision or application in any other jurisdiction.

Exhibit B  
 ANTARES PHARMA, INC. 
 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT 
 As an employee of Antares Pharma, Inc. (the  Company ), I acknowledge that the Company operates in a competitive environment and that it enhances its opportunities to succeed by establishing policies designed to identify and secure the Company s Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information. This Agreement is designed to make clear that: 

i)   
 
 I will maintain the confidentiality of the Company s Proprietary Information and use such Proprietary Information for the exclusive benefit of the Company;    

ii)   
 
 Inventions that I create will be owned by the Company; and    

iii)   
 
 My activities separate from the Company will not conflict with the Company s development of its proprietary rights.    

 In consideration of my employment and/or the continuation of my employment by the Company, I hereby agree as follows: 

1.   
 
 Provisions Related to Trade Secrets    

(a)   
 
 I acknowledge that the Company possesses and will continue to develop and acquire valuable Proprietary Information (as defined below), including information that I may develop or discover as a result of my employment with the Company.    

(b)   
 
 As used in this Agreement,  Proprietary Information  means any information (including any compilation, device, method, technique or process) that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and includes information of the Company, its customers, suppliers, joint ventures, licensors, licensees, distributors and other persons and entities with whom the Company does business.    

(c)   
 
 I will not disclose or use at any time, either during or after my employment with the Company, any Proprietary Information except for the exclusive benefit of the Company as required by my duties for the Company, as the Company expressly may consent to in writing or in accordance with Sections 1(d) and (e) below. Except as specifically authorized under Sections 1(d) and (e) below, I will cooperate with the Company to implement reasonable measures to maintain the secrecy of, and will use my best efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure, use or reproduction of, all Proprietary Information.    

(d)   
 
    I understand that nothing in this Agreement restricts or prohibits me from initiating communications directly with, responding to any inquiries from, providing testimony before, providing confidential information to, reporting possible violations of law or regulation to, or from filing a claim or assisting with an investigation directly with a self-regulatory authority or a government agency or entity, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General (collectively, the  Regulators ), or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal law or regulation. However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, I am waiving my right to receive any individual monetary relief from the Company or any others covered by the Release of Claims resulting from such claims or conduct, regardless of whether I or another party has filed them, and in the event I obtain such monetary relief the Company will be entitled to an offset for the payments made pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement does not limit my right to receive an award from any Regulator that provides awards for providing information relating to a potential violation of law. I do not need the prior authorization of the Company to engage in conduct protected by this paragraph, and the Executive does not need to notify the Company that I have engaged in such conduct.     

 Please take notice that federal law provides criminal and civil immunity to federal and state claims for trade secret misappropriation to individuals who disclose a trade secret to their attorney, a court, or a government official in certain, confidential circumstances that are set forth at 18 U.S.C.    1833(b)(1) and 1833(b)(2), related to the reporting or investigation of a suspected violation of the law, or in connection with a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of the law. 

(e)   
 
 Upon leaving employment with the Company for any reason, I immediately will deliver to the Company any property, records, documents and other tangible materials (including all copies) in my possession or under my control, including data incorporated in word processing, computer and other data storage media, containing or disclosing Proprietary Information, except as otherwise permitted in accordance with Sections 1(d) and (e) above.    

2.   
 
    Ownership of Inventions     

(a)   
 
 I agree to communicate to the Company as promptly and fully as practicable all Inventions (as defined below) conceived or reduced to practice by me (alone or jointly by others) at any time during my employment with the Company. I hereby assign to the Company and/or its nominees all my right, title and interest in such Inventions, and all my right, title and interest in any patents, copyrights, patent applications or copyright applications based thereon. I will give the Company and/or its nominees (at no expense to me) any assistance it reasonably requires to perfect, protect and use its rights to all such Inventions anywhere in the world.    

(b)   
 
 As used in this Agreement, the term  Inventions  includes, but is not limited to, all discoveries, improvements, processes, developments, designs, know-how, data, computer programs and formulae, whether patentable or unpatentable or protectable by copyright or other intellectual property law.    

(c)   
 
 Any provision in this Agreement requiring me to assign my rights in any Invention does not apply to an Invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of the Company was used, and which was developed entirely on my own time, and which:    

(i)   
 
 does not relate directly to the Company s business or to the Company s anticipated research or development, or    

(ii)   
 
 does not result from any work performed by me for the Company.    

(d)   
 
 I hereby designate and appoint the Company and each of its duly authorized officers as my agent and attorney-in-fact to act for and in my behalf to execute and file any document, and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance and enforcement of patents, copyrights and other proprietary rights with the same force and effect as if executed and delivered by me.    

3.   
 
 Conflicts With Other Activities    

 I understand that my employment with the Company and my compliance with this Agreement do not and will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence any information acquired by me prior to or outside of my employment with the Company. I have not brought and will not bring with me to the Company for use in the performance of my duties at the Company any materials, documents or information of a former employer or any third party that are not generally available to the public unless I have obtained express written authorization from the owner for their possession and use by or for the Company. I have not entered into and will not enter into any agreement, either oral or written, in conflict with this Agreement. 

4.   
 
 Miscellaneous    

(a)   
 
 My obligations under this Agreement may not be modified or terminated, in whole or in any part, except in a writing signed by the Company. Any waiver by     

the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.     

(b)   
 
 Each provision of this Agreement will be treated as a separate and independent clause, and the unenforceability of any one provision will in no way impair the enforceability of any other provision. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such provision will be construed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting or reducing it to the minimum extent necessary to make it legally enforceable.    

(c)   
 
 My obligations under this Agreement will survive the termination of my employment, regardless of the manner of such termination. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company.    

(d)   
 
 I understand that the provisions of this Agreement are a material condition to my employment and/or continued employment with the Company. I also understand that this Agreement is not an employment contract, and nothing in this Agreement creates any right to my continuous employment by the Company, or to my employment for any particular term.    

(e)   
 
 Any breach of this Agreement likely will cause irreparable harm to the Company for which money damages could not reasonably or adequately compensate the Company. Accordingly, I agree that the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement, in addition to damages and other available remedies.    

 SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT CREATES IMPORTANT OBLIGATIONS OF TRUST AND AFFECTS THE EMPLOYEE S RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS THE EMPLOYEE MAY MAKE DURING HIS/HER EMPLOYMENT.
