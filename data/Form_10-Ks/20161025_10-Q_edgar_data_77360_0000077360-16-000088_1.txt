1.  Basis of Presentation and Responsibility for Interim Financial Statements 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Pentair plc (formerly Pentair Ltd.) and its subsidiaries ("we," "us," "our," "Pentair," or "the Company") have been prepared following the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America can be condensed or omitted. 
  We are responsible for the unaudited financial statements included in this document. The financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and operating results. As these are condensed financial statements, one should also read our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Revenues, expenses, cash flows, assets and liabilities can and do vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be indicative of those for a full year. 
  Our fiscal year ends on December 31. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we report our interim quarterly periods on a calendar quarter basis. Prior to the first quarter of 2016, we reported our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday. 
  New accounting standards 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new accounting standard that will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements regarding accounting for leases, which requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the potential effects on our financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies and simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Under the new standard, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our financial condition.   
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2016 and, as a result, reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of $23.5 million from   Other current assets   and   Other non-current assets   to   Long-term debt   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The new requirements include additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We have not yet determined the potential effects on our financial condition or results of operations.  
   
           2. 
    Acquisitions 
     On September 18, 2015, we acquired, as part of Technical Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of ERICO Global Company ("ERICO") for approximately   $1.8 billion   (the "ERICO Acquisition"). ERICO is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of engineered electrical and fastening products for electrical, mechanical and civil applications.

     Table of Contents  
  Pentair plc and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) 

ERICO has employees in 30 countries across the world with recognized brands including CADDY fixing, fastening and support products; ERICO electrical grounding, bonding and connectivity products and LENTON engineered systems. 
  The purchase price has been allocated based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the ERICO Acquisition. The purchase price allocation was completed in the third quarter of 2016. 
  The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the ERICO Acquisition as previously reported at   December 31, 2015   and as revised at   September 30, 2016  : 

The excess of purchase price over tangible net assets and identified intangible assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill in the amount of   $1,031.0 million  , none of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the ERICO Acquisition include   $228.4 million   of indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets and   $805.4 million   of definite-lived customer relationships with an estimated useful life of   21   years. 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial results of operations are presented as if the ERICO Acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2014: 

The pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and includes certain adjustments, as noted above. The adjustments are estimates based on currently available information and actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates. They do not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that would have been expected to result from the integration of the ERICO Acquisition. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the ERICO Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014. 
  In April 2015, we acquired, as part of Technical Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Nuheat Industries Limited ("Nuheat") for   $96.0 million   in cash (  120.5 million   Canadian dollars translated at the April 2, 2015 exchange rate), net of cash acquired.  In November 2015, cash of   $0.9 million   (  1.2 million   Canadian dollars translated at the average monthly exchange rate) was paid to Nuheat in settlement of a working capital adjustment. Based in Canada, Nuheat is a leading manufacturer of electric floor heating systems that are distributed across North America. Total goodwill recorded as part of the

     Table of Contents

  Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) 

purchase allocation was   $43.2 million  , none of which is tax deductible. Identified intangible assets acquired consisted of definite-lived customer relationships of   $53.3 million  , with an estimated useful life of 17 years. The pro forma impact of this acquisition was deemed to not be material. 

3. 
    Discontinued Operations  
     On August 18, 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to sell our Valves   Controls business to Emerson Electric Co. for a purchase price of   $3.15 billion   in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments. We expect the sale to close in late 2016 or early 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. 
    
  We have concluded, as a result of the signing of the Purchase Agreement, that the Valves   Controls business has met the criteria to be held for sale. The results of the Valves   Controls business have been presented as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. The Valves   Controls business was previously disclosed as a stand-alone reporting segment. 
    
  In addition, during the first and second quarters of 2015, we sold the remaining portions of the Water Transport business in Australia and received cash proceeds of   $59.0 million  . The results of the Water Transport business have been presented as discontinued operations.  
  Transaction costs of   $15.6 million   related to the sale of Valves   Controls were incurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Operating results of discontinued operations are summarized below:

The carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows: 

4. 
    Share Plans 
     Total share-based compensation expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was as follows:    

In the first quarter of   2016  , we issued our annual share-based compensation grants under the Pentair plc 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan to eligible employees. The total number of awards issued was approximately   1.7 million  , of which   1.1 million   were stock options,   0.3 million   were restricted stock units and   0.3 million   were performance share units. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units issued was   $10.23  ,   $49.21   and   $49.21  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  
  Pentair plc and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) 

We estimated the fair value of each stock option award issued in the annual share-based compensation grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, modified for dividends and using the following assumptions:   

  These estimates require us to make assumptions based on historical results, observance of trends in our share price, changes in option exercise behavior, future expectations and other relevant factors. If other assumptions had been used, share-based compensation expense, as calculated and recorded under the accounting guidance, could have been affected. 
  We based the expected life assumption on historical experience as well as the terms and vesting periods of the options granted. For purposes of determining expected share price volatility, we considered a rolling average of historical volatility measured over a period approximately equal to the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate for periods that coincide with the expected life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury Department yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
   
           5. 
    Restructuring 
     During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we continued execution of certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business. Initiatives during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included the reduction in hourly and salaried headcount of approximately   475   employees, consisting of approximately   75   in Water Quality Systems,   100   in Flow   Filtration Solutions and   300   in Technical Solutions. Initiatives during the year ended   December 31, 2015   included the reduction in hourly and salaried headcount of approximately   500   employees, consisting of approximately   100   in Water Quality Systems,   200   in Flow   Filtration Solutions and   200   in Technical Solutions. 
  Restructuring related costs included in   Selling, general and administrative   expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) included costs for severance and other restructuring costs as follows:    

Other restructuring costs primarily consist of asset impairment and various contract termination costs. 
  Restructuring costs by reportable segment for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows:

Debt and the average interest rates on debt outstanding were as follows:    

In September 2015, Pentair plc, Pentair Finance S.A. ("PFSA") and Pentair Investments Switzerland GmbH ("PISG"), a 100-percent owned subsidiary of Pentair plc and the 100-percent owner of PFSA, completed public offerings (the "September 2015 Offerings") of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   2.90%   Senior Notes due   2018  ,   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   3.625%   Senior Notes due   2020  ,   $250 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   4.65%   Senior Notes due   2025   and    500 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   2.45%   Senior Notes due   2019  . Pentair plc used the net proceeds from the September 2015 Offerings to finance the ERICO Acquisition.  
  The Senior Notes issued in the September 2015 Offerings,   1.875%   Senior Notes due   2017  ,   2.65%   Senior Notes due   2019  ,   $373.0 million   of the   5.00%   Senior Notes due   2021   and   3.15%   Senior Notes due   2022   issued by PFSA and   $127.0 million   of the   5.00%   Senior Notes due   2021   issued by Pentair, Inc. (collectively, the "Notes") are guaranteed as to payment by Pentair plc and PISG.  
  In October 2014, Pentair plc, PISG, PFSA and Pentair, Inc. entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Facility"), with Pentair plc and PISG as guarantors and PFSA and Pentair, Inc. as borrowers. The Credit Facility had a maximum aggregate availability of   $2,100.0 million   and a maturity date of October 3, 2019. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a specified margin based upon PFSA's credit ratings. PFSA must pay a facility fee ranging from   9.0   to   25.0   basis points per annum (based upon PFSA's credit ratings) on the amount of each lender's commitment and letter of credit fee for each letter of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility.  
  In August 2015, Pentair plc, PISG and PFSA entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Facility (the "First Amendment"), which, among other things, increased the maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined below). In September 2015, Pentair plc, PISG and PFSA entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Facility (the "Second Amendment"), which, among other things, increased the maximum aggregate availability to   $2,500.0 million  . Additionally, in September 2016, Pentair plc, PISG and PFSA entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Facility (the "Third Amendment," and collectively with the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, the "Amendments"), which, among other things, increased the maximum Leverage Ratio to the amounts specified below, and amended the definition of EBITDA to include earnings from discontinued operations for operations subject to a sale agreement until such disposition actually occurs. 
  PFSA is authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. PFSA uses the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , PFSA had   $454.3 million   and   $179.5 million  , respectively, of commercial paper outstanding, all of which

     Table of Contents  
  Pentair plc and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) 

was classified as long-term debt as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility. 
  Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the most restrictive of which are in the Credit Facility (as updated for the Amendments), including that we may not permit (i) the ratio of our consolidated debt plus synthetic lease obligations to our consolidated net income (excluding, among other things, non-cash gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation expense, and up to a lifetime maximum   $25.0 million   of costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain acquisitions, investments, dispositions and the issuance, repayment or refinancing of debt, ("EBITDA") for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended (the "Leverage Ratio") to exceed (a) 4.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on September 30, 2016; (b) 4.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on December 31, 2016; (c) 4.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on March 31, 2017; (d)   4.00   to 1.00 as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on June 30, 2017; and (e)   3.50   to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending thereafter, and (ii) the ratio of our EBITDA for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to our consolidated interest expense, including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations (if any), for the same period to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. For purposes of the Leverage Ratio, the Credit Facility provides for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions, divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements  .  
  Total availability under the Credit Facility was   $1,430.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which was limited to   $733.6 million   by the maximum Leverage Ratio in the Credit Facility s credit agreement. 
  In addition to the Credit Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of   $51.9 million  , of which   none   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. 
  We have   $350.0 million   of fixed rate senior notes maturing in September   2017  . We classified this debt as long-term as of   September 30, 2016   as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility. 
  Debt outstanding, excluding unamortized issuance costs and discounts, at   September 30, 2016   matures on a calendar year basis as follows:

    Derivatives and Financial Instruments 
     Derivative financial instruments 
  We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness. To manage the volatility related to these exposures, we periodically enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates. The derivative contracts contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. The amount of such credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains, if any, in such contracts. Such risk is minimized by limiting those counterparties to major financial institutions of high credit quality. 
  Foreign currency contracts 
  We conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain market-based risks through the use of foreign currency derivative financial instruments. Our objective in holding these derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year. To hedge currency exposure related to certain non-functional currency intercompany debt, we have entered into cross-currency swap contracts for periods consistent with the underlying debt.

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of   $543.9 million   and   $331.5 million  , respectively. The impact of these contracts on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) is not material for any period presented. 
  Gains or losses on foreign currency contracts designated as hedges are reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ("AOCI") and into   Selling, general and administrative   expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) upon settlement. Such reclassifications during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were not material. 
  Net investment hedge 
  We have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are subject to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate. In September 2015, we designated the    500.0 million 2.45% Senior Notes due 2019   (the "2019 Euro Notes") as a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investment in our Euro denominated subsidiaries. The gains/losses on the 2019 Euro Notes have been included as a component of the cumulative translation adjustment account within AOCI. We had deferred foreign currency gains of   $4.1 million   and   $16.4 million   in AOCI associated with the net investment hedge activity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Fair value measurements 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date: 
                      Level 1: 
       
    Valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2: 
       
    Valuation is based on inputs such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3: 
       
    Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. 

In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  Fair value of financial instruments 
  The following methods were used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instruments:    
             
    short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable and variable-rate debt)   recorded amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity period; 
                
    long-term fixed-rate debt, including current maturities   fair value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar terms, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by the accounting guidance; and 
                
    foreign currency contract agreements   fair values are determined through the use of models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by the accounting guidance. 
     The recorded amounts and estimated fair values of total debt, excluding unamortized issuance costs and discounts, were as follows:

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis were as follows:   

(1) 
    Deferred compensation plan assets include mutual funds, common/collective trusts and cash equivalents for payment of certain non-qualified benefits for retired, terminated and active employees. The fair value of mutual funds and cash equivalents were based on quoted market prices in active markets. The underlying investments in the common/collective trusts primarily include intermediate and long-term debt securities, corporate debt securities, equity securities and fixed income securities. The overall fair value of the common/collective trusts are based on observable inputs. 
              (2) 
    During the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the Valves   Controls reporting unit using the required two-step process as of December 31, 2015. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of   $515.2 million  .  
     The first step of this process includes comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated to identify potential impairment. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from those used in our valuations.  
  Step two compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.  
           (3) 
    During the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment test for the Valves   Controls trade names. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash trade name impairment charge of   $39.5 million  . The fair value of trade names is measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.  
     The Valves   Controls business referred to above has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and is presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and therefore have our tax residency in the U.K. The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for U.K. and international income taxes. We operate in an international environment with operations in various locations outside the U.K. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates. 
  The effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   21.5%  , compared to   22.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 26, 2015  . We continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate. The tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution. 
  The liability for uncertain tax positions of continuing operations was   $48.3 million   and   $45.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The liability for uncertain tax positions of discontinued operations was   $27.8 million   and   $24.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in   Provision for income taxes   and   Net interest expense  , respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), which is consistent with our past practices. 
   
   Components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension plans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows: 

Components of net periodic benefit cost for our other post-retirement plans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were not material.

    Shareholders  Equity 
     Ordinary shares held in treasury 
  In August 2015, we canceled all of our ordinary shares held in treasury. At the time of the cancellation, we held   19.1 million   ordinary shares in treasury at a cost of   $1.2 billion  . 
  Share repurchases 
  In December 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of   $1.0 billion  . The authorization expires on   December 31, 2019  . During the nine months ended   September 26, 2015  , we repurchased   3.1 million   of our shares for   $200.0 million   pursuant to this authorization. There were   no   share repurchases during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   pursuant to this authorization. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $800.0 million   available for share repurchases under this authorization.  
  Dividends payable 
  On December 8, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the 2016 annual cash dividend to   $1.34  , to be paid to our shareholders in four quarterly installments of   $0.33   in each of the first and second quarters of 2016 and   $0.34   in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016.  
    
  On October 4, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.34   payable on November 4, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 21, 2016. As a result, there were   no   dividends payable included in   Other current liabilities   on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and a balance of   $59.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
   
           14. 
    Segment Information 
     We evaluate performance based on net sales and segment income (loss) and use a variety of ratios to measure performance of our reporting segments. Segment income (loss) represents equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and operating income exclusive of intangible amortization, certain acquisition related expenses, costs of restructuring activities, "mark-to-market" gain/loss for pension and other post-retirement plans, impairments and other unusual non-operating items. 
  Financial information by reportable segment is as follows:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Asbestos matters 
  Our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. While we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. Our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   4,000   claims outstanding against our subsidiaries, of which approximately   3,500   relate to the Valves   Control business classified as held for sale. These amounts include adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted. The amounts are not adjusted for claims that identify incorrect defendants or duplicate other actions. In addition, the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification. 
  Periodically, we perform an analysis with the assistance of outside counsel and other experts to update our estimated asbestos-related assets and liabilities. Our estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on our historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed. Our legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates. 
  Our estimate of asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to our estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers. 
  Our estimated liability for asbestos-related claims was   $231.2 million   and   $237.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was recorded in   Non-current liabilities held for sale   in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs. Our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was   $109.3 million   and   $111.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was recorded in   Non-current assets held for sale   in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The amounts recorded by us for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on our strategies for resolving our asbestos claims and currently available information as well as estimates and assumptions. Key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, the amounts of insurance and the related solvency risk with respect to our insurance carriers, and the indemnifications we have provided to and received from third parties. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the latter portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect our liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance

policies among subsidiaries. As a result, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in our calculations vary significantly from actual results. 
  Environmental matters 
  We are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and, including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations, related to certain formerly owned businesses. Our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on current law and existing technologies. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of   $18.0 million   and   $22.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which relate primarily to the Valves   Controls business classified as held for sale. We do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Warranties and guarantees 
  In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or other obligations. The subject matter, amounts and duration of any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  We recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. 
  We provide service and warranty policies on our products. Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a review of historical warranty and service claim experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience warrant. 
  The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties of continuing operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were as follows:       

  Stand-by letters of credit, bank guarantees and bonds 
  In certain situations, Tyco International Ltd., Pentair Ltd.'s former parent company ("Tyco"), guaranteed performance by the flow control business of Pentair Ltd. ("Flow Control") to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of Pentair Ltd. In situations where Flow Control and Tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spin-off of Pentair Ltd., we will indemnify Tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees. 
  In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any non-performance. The outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs.

  Overview 
  The terms "us," "we" or "our" refer to Pentair plc (formerly Pentair Ltd.) and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprising three reporting segments: Water Quality Systems, Flow   Filtration Solutions, and Technical Solutions. For the first   nine months   of   2016  , Water Quality Systems, Flow   Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions, represented approximately   27 percent  ,   28 percent   and   45 percent   of total revenues, respectively. We classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served: 
             
    Water Quality Systems     The Water Quality Systems segment designs, manufactures, markets and services innovative water system products and solutions to meet filtration and fluid management challenges in food and beverage, water, swimming pools and aquaculture applications.  
                  
    Flow   Filtration Solutions     The Flow   Filtration Solutions segment designs, manufactures, markets and services solutions for the toughest filtration, separation, flow and fluid management challenges in agriculture, food and beverage processing, water supply and disposal and a variety of industrial applications.  
                
    Technical Solutions     The Technical Solutions segment designs, manufactures, markets and services products that guard and protect some of the world s most sensitive electrical and electronic equipment, as well as heat management solutions designed to provide thermal protection to temperature sensitive fluid applications and engineered electrical and fastening products for electrical, mechanical and civil applications.  
     On August 18, 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell our Valves   Controls business to Emerson Electric Co. for a purchase price of   $3.15 billion   in cash, subject to customary adjustments. We expect the sale to close in late 2016 or early 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. The results of the Valves   Controls business have been presented as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. The Valves   Controls business was previously disclosed as a stand-alone reporting segment. 
  On September 18, 2015, we acquired, as part of Technical Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of ERICO Global Company ("ERICO") for approximately   $1.8 billion   (the "ERICO Acquisition"). ERICO is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of engineered electrical and fastening products for electrical, mechanical and civil applications. ERICO has employees in 30 countries across the world with recognized brands including CADDY fixing, fastening and support products; ERICO electrical grounding, bonding and connectivity products and LENTON engineered systems.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we report our interim quarterly periods on a calendar quarter basis. Prior to the first quarter of 2016, we reported our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday. 
  Key Trends and Uncertainties Regarding Our Existing Business 
  The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in   2015   and the first   nine months   of   2016   and will likely impact our results in the future: 

Despite the favorable long-term outlook for our end-markets, we experience differing levels of volatility depending on the end-market and may continue to do so over the medium and longer term. During   2015   and the first   nine months   of   2016  , our core sales have been challenged by broad-based industrial capital expenditure and maintenance deferrals. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.    
                
    We experienced declines in project orders, particularly within the industrial and energy businesses. We expect headwinds in the industrial and energy businesses to continue and oil prices to remain depressed throughout   2016  . 
                
    We initiated restructuring actions to offset the negative earnings impact of core revenue decline and foreign exchange. We expect to continue these actions throughout   2016   and that these actions will contribute to margin growth in   2016  . 
                
    Our results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most key global currencies for the first nine months of   2016  . We expect this trend to continue throughout   2016  .  
                
    We have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue, both within and outside the United States. We are reinforcing our businesses to more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources. Unless we successfully penetrate these markets, our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline. 
                
    We have experienced material and other cost inflation. We strive for productivity improvements, and we implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate this inflation. We expect the current economic environment will result in continuing price volatility for many of our raw materials, and we are uncertain as to the timing and impact of these market changes. 
     In 2016, our operating objectives include the following: 
             
    Reducing long-term debt and overall leverage through improved cash flow performance and the pending sale of the Valves   Controls business; 
                
    Driving operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives, with specific focus on sourcing and supply management, cash flow management and lean operations; 
                
    Achieving differentiated revenue growth through new products and global and market expansion; 
                
    Optimizing our technological capabilities to increasingly generate innovative new products; and 
                
    Focusing on developing global talent in light of our increased global presence.

Net sales 
  The components of the consolidated net sales change from the prior period were as follows: 

The   8.8   and   11.3   percent   increase  s in consolidated net sales in the   third quarter and first nine months  , respectively, of   2016   from   2015   were primarily driven by: 
              
    core sales growth in Water Quality Systems, primarily as the result of increased volume in the United States and Canada. 
     These   increase  s were partially offset by: 
             
    continued slowdown in capital spending, particularly in the industrial and energy businesses, driving core sales declines in Flow   Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions;  
                
    slowing economic activity in certain developing regions, including China and Brazil; and 
                
    a strong U.S. dollar causing unfavorable foreign currency effects for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     Gross profit 
  The   0.9   and   1.5   percentage point   increase  s in gross profit as a percentage of sales in the   third quarter and first nine months  , respectively, of   2016   from   2015   were primarily driven by:  
             
    higher contribution margin as a result of savings generated from our Pentair Integrated Management System ("PIMS") initiatives including lean and supply management practices; and 
                
    selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases. 
     These   increase  s were partially offset by: 
             
    inflationary increases related to raw materials and labor costs. 
     Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") 
  The   0.8   percentage point   decrease   in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the   third quarter   of   2016   from   2015   was primarily driven by:  
             
    cost control and savings generated from back-office consolidation, reduction in personnel and other lean initiatives. 
     This   decrease   was partially offset by: 
             
    amortization expense of   $24.1 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to   $14.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , respectively, as a result of the ERICO Acquisition; and 
                
    increased investment in sales and marketing to drive growth.

     Table of Contents  

The   0.2   percentage point increase in SG A expense as a percentage of sales for the first nine months of   2016   from   2015   was primarily driven by:  
              
    increased investment in sales and marketing to drive growth. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    savings generated from back-office consolidation, reduction in personnel and other lean initiatives. 
     Net interest expense 
  The   11.0   and   56.9   percent   increase  s in net interest expense in the   third quarter and first nine months  , respectively, of   2016   from   2015   were primarily driven by:  
             
    the impact of higher debt levels during the   third quarter and first nine months   of   2016  , compared to the   third quarter and first nine months   of   2015  , primarily as the result of the September 2015 issuance of senior notes to finance the ERICO Acquisition; and 
                
    increased overall interest rates in effect on our outstanding debt. 
     Provision for income taxes 
  The   1.0   percentage point   decrease   in the effective tax rate in the   third quarter and first nine months   of   2016   from   2015   was primarily driven by: 
     the mix of global earnings toward lower tax jurisdictions. 
    
  SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our three reportable segments (Water Quality Systems, Flow   Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions). Each of these segments is comprised of various product offerings that serve multiple end users. 
    
  We evaluate the performance o  f our three reportable segments     based on net sales and segment income and use a variety of ratios to measure performance. Segment income represents equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and operating income exclusive of intangible amortization, certain acquisition related expenses, costs of restructuring activities, "mark-to-market" gain/loss for pension and other post-retirement plans, impairments and other unusual non-operating items. 
  Water Quality Systems 
  The net sales and segment income for Water Quality Systems for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows:

Net sales 
  The components of the change in Water Quality Systems net sales from the prior period were as follows: 

The   2.0   and   4.0   percent   increase  s in net sales for Water Quality Systems in the   third quarter and first nine months  , respectively, of   2016   from   2015   were primarily driven by: 
             
    core sales growth related to higher sales of certain pool products primarily serving North American residential housing for the   third quarter and first nine months   of   2016  ; 
                
    core sales growth in the water filtration business in the United States; and 
                
    selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases. 
     These   increase  s were partially offset by 
             
    a strong U.S. dollar causing unfavorable foreign currency effects during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ; and  
                
    core sales declines in Western Europe and in certain developing regions, including China and Latin America.

    favorable material savings and product mix offsetting inflation;  
                
    selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases; and  
                
    savings generated from PIMS initiatives including lean and supply management practices. 
     These   increase  s were partially offset by: 
             
    inflationary increases related to labor costs and certain raw materials; and 
                
    continued growth investments in research   development and sales   marketing.

    core sales declines in the food   beverage business during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due mainly to weak irrigation sales and lower project sales;  
                
    continued slowdown in industrial capital spending, driving core sales declines in the industrial business; 
                
    continued sales declines in China and Latin America as the result of economic uncertainty; and 
                
    a strong U.S. dollar causing unfavorable foreign currency effects during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
     These   decrease  s were partially offset by: 
             
    core sales growth related to higher sales of pump and filtration solutions serving the infrastructure businesses during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ; and

    lower margin greenfield project sales not offsetting the decline in higher margin product sales; and 
                
    inflationary increases related to labor costs and certain raw materials. 
     These   decrease  s were partially offset by: 
             
    higher core sales in our industrial and residential and commercial businesses during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which resulted in increased leverage on operating expenses; and 
                
    strong margin contribution and integration synergies as a result of the ERICO Acquisition. 
      
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
  We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances, public and private debt and equity offerings. Our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions. We intend to issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a short-term basis and to use our revolving credit facility as back-up liquidity to support commercial paper. 
  We are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt, while continuing to fund our research and development, marketing and capital investment initiatives. Our intent is to maintain investment grade credit ratings and a solid liquidity position. 
  We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within Water Quality Systems, Flow   Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions. We generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes, which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks. End-user demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale "early buy" programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts. Additionally, Technical Solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and increased demand for electrical fastening products during the spring and summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. 
  Operating activities 
  Cash   provided by   operating activities of continuing operations was   $459.7 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $354.5 million   in the same period of   2015  .  
  The   $459.7 million   in net cash   provided by   operating activities of continuing operations in the first   nine months   of   2016   primarily reflects net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation and amortization of   $478.9 million   and were negatively impacted by   $5.2 million   as a result of changes in net working capital.  
    
  The   $354.5 million   in net cash   provided by   operating activities of continuing operations in the first   nine months   of   2015   primarily reflects net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation and amortization of   $396.7 million   and were negatively impacted by   $48.1 million   as a result of changes in net working capital.

Investing activities 
  Cash   used for   investing activities of continuing operations was   $74.2 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $1,975.7 million   in the same period of   2015  . Net cash   used for   investing activities of continuing operations in the first   nine months   of   2016   primarily relates to capital expenditures of   $94.5 million  , partially offset by   $24.1 million   of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Net cash   used for   investing activities of continuing operations in the first   nine months   of   2015   relates primarily relates to capital expenditures of   $66.3 million   and cash of   $1,913.0 million   (net of cash acquired) used to acquire ERICO Global Company during the third quarter of 2015 and Nuheat Industries Limited during the second quarter of   2015   as part of Technical Solutions, partially offset by   $3.6 million   of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. 
  We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal   2016   to be approximately $130 million, primarily for capacity expansions of manufacturing facilities, developing new products and general maintenance. 
  Financing activities 
  Net cash   used for   financing activities was   $444.5 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016  , compared with net cash   provided by   financing activities of   $1,612.5 million   in the prior year period. Net cash   used for   financing activities in the first   nine months   of   2016   primarily included net repayments of commercial paper and revolving long-term debt and payment of dividends. Net cash   provided by   financing activities in the first   nine months   of   2015   was primarily due to cash proceeds received from the September 2015 issuance of senior notes (discussed below), partially offset by share repurchases and payment of dividends.  
  In September 2015, Pentair plc, Pentair Finance S.A. ("PFSA") and Pentair Investments Switzerland GmbH ("PISG"), a 100-percent owned subsidiary of Pentair plc and the 100-percent owner of PFSA, completed public offerings (the "September 2015 Offerings") of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   2.90%   Senior Notes due   2018  ,   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   3.625%   Senior Notes due   2020  ,   $250 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   4.65%   Senior Notes due   2025   and    500 million   aggregate principal amount of PFSA's   2.45%   Senior Notes due   2019  , all of which are guaranteed as to payment by Pentair plc and PISG. Pentair plc used the net proceeds from the September 2015 Offerings to finance the ERICO Acquisition.  
  The Senior Notes issued in the September 2015 Offerings,   1.875%   Senior Notes due   2017  ,   2.65%   Senior Notes due   2019  ,   $373.0 million   of the   5.00%   Senior Notes due   2021   and   3.15%   Senior Notes due   2022   issued by PFSA and   $127.0 million   of the   5.00%   Senior Notes due   2021   issued by Pentair, Inc. (collectively, the "Notes") are guaranteed as to payment by Pentair plc and PISG.  
  In October 2014, Pentair plc, PISG, PFSA and Pentair, Inc. entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Facility"), with Pentair plc and PISG as guarantors and PFSA and Pentair, Inc. as borrowers. The Credit Facility had a maximum aggregate availability of   $2,100.0 million   and a maturity date of October 3, 2019. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a specified margin based upon PFSA's credit ratings. PFSA must pay a facility fee ranging from   9.0   to   25.0   basis points per annum (based upon PFSA's credit ratings) on the amount of each lender's commitment and letter of credit fee for each letter of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility.  
  In August 2015, Pentair plc, PISG and PFSA entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Facility (the "First Amendment"), which, among other things, increased the maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined below). In September 2015, Pentair plc, PISG and PFSA entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Facility (the "Second Amendment,"), which, among other things, increased the maximum aggregate availability to   $2,500.0 million  . Additionally, in September 2016, Pentair plc, PISG and PFSA entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Facility (the "Third Amendment," and collectively with the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, the "Amendments"), which, among other things, increased the maximum Leverage Ratio to the amounts specified below, and amended the definition of EBITDA to include earnings from discontinued operations for operations subject to a sale agreement until such disposition actually occurs. 
  PFSA is authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. PFSA uses the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , PFSA had   $454.3 million   and   $179.5 million  , respectively, of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was classified as long-term debt as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility. 
  Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the most restrictive of which are in the Credit Facility (as updated for the Amendments), including that we may not permit (i) the ratio of our consolidated debt plus synthetic lease obligations to our consolidated net income (excluding, among other things, non-cash gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation expense, up to a lifetime maximum   $25.0 million   of costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain acquisitions, investments, dispositions and the issuance, repayment or refinancing of debt, ("EBITDA") for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended (the "Leverage Ratio") to exceed (a) 4.50 to 1.00 as of the last

day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on September 30, 2016; (b) 4.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on December 31, 2016; (c) 4.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on March 31, 2017; (d) 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on June 30, 2017; and (e) 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending thereafter, and (ii) the ratio of our EBITDA for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to our consolidated interest expense, including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations (if any), for the same period to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. For purposes of the Leverage Ratio, the Credit Facility provides for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions, divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements  .  
  Total availability under the Credit Facility was   $1,430.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which was limited to   $733.6 million   by the maximum Leverage Ratio in the Credit Facility s credit agreement. 
  In addition to the Credit Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of   $51.9 million  , of which   none   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $99.5 million   of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences. 
  We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly. We believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities. 
    
  Share repurchases 
  In December 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of   $1.0 billion  . The authorization expires on   December 31, 2019  . During the three months ended   September 26, 2015  , we repurchased   3.1 million   of our shares for   $200.0 million   pursuant to this authorization. There were   no   share repurchases during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $800.0 million   remaining available for share repurchases under this authorization.  
    
  Dividends payable 
  On December 8, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the 2016 annual cash dividend to   $1.34  , to be paid to our shareholders in four quarterly installments of   $0.33   in each of the first and second quarters of 2016 and   $0.34   in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016.  
    
  On October 4, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.34   payable on November 4, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 21, 2016. As a result, there were   no   dividends payable included in   Other current liabilities   on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and a balance of   $59.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  We paid dividends in the first   nine months   of   2016   of   $181.6 million  , or   $1.00   per ordinary share, compared with   $173.3 million  , or   $0.96   per ordinary share, in the prior year period.  
  Under Irish law, the payment of future cash dividends and redemptions and repurchases of shares may be paid only out of Pentair plc's "distributable reserves" on its statutory balance sheet. Pentair plc is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the Irish High Court. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). As of December 31, 2015, our distributable reserve balance was   $9.6 billion  . 
  Other financial measures 
  In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure our free cash flow. We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends, make acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase shares. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new accounting standard that will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We have not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements regarding accounting for leases, which requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the potential effects on our financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies and simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Under the new standard, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our financial condition.   
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2016 and, as a result, reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of $23.5 million from   Other current assets   and   Other non-current assets   to   Long-term debt   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The new requirements include additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We have not yet determined the potential effects on our financial condition or results of operations.  
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  In our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified the critical accounting policies which affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We have not changed these policies from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report.

  (b)    Changes in Internal Controls 
  As part of our ongoing integration activities after the ERICO Acquisition, we are continuing to incorporate our controls and procedures into the ERICO business and to augment our company-wide controls. There was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
  THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT   (this    Agreement   ), dated as of August 18, 2016, by and between Emerson Electric Co., a Missouri corporation (   Buyer   ), and Pentair plc, an Irish public limited company (   Parent   ). 
  RECITALS 
  WHEREAS,   Parent, indirectly through its subsidiaries listed as Sellers in   Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule   (each, a    Seller  ,  and together, the    Sellers   ), owns stock, shares, quotas, investment capital, membership units and interests, capital, limited liability or partnership interests or other equity ownership interests (the    Shares   ) of the entities listed as Companies in   Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule   (each, a    Company  ,  and together, the    Companies   ). 
  WHEREAS,   the Companies and the Subsidiaries are engaged in the Business. 
  WHEREAS,   the parties desire that Parent shall cause the Sellers to sell, convey, assign and transfer to Buyer, and to cause to be sold, conveyed, assigned and transferred to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers all of the Purchased Shares and, subject to   Section 1.3  , the Specified Individual Shares, upon the terms and conditions herein set forth. 
  WHEREAS,   capitalized terms not defined in the context in the section in which such terms first appear shall have the meaning set forth in   Section 11.16  . 
  NOW THEREFORE,   in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  ARTICLE 1       PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES 
  1.1        Purchase and Sale of the Shares  .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Sellers to sell, convey, assign and transfer to Buyer, and to cause to be sold, conveyed, assigned and transferred to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers, all right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Shares and, subject to   Section 1.3  , the Specified Individual Shares;   provided   that in the case of the Purchased Shares that are Individual Shares (other than the Specified Individual Shares), Parent s obligation to sell, convey, assign and transfer to Buyer any such Individual Share shall be satisfied if Parent provides to Buyer a copy of an Ancillary Agreement executed by the Individual Owner of such Individual Share transferring such Individual Share to a Company, Subsidiary, Active Employee or other Person designated by Buyer. 
  1.2        Designated Purchasers  .  Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may, upon not less than five Business Days  prior written notice to Parent, assign its rights and obligations, in whole or in part, under this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (each such entity, a    Designated Purchaser   ) for the purpose of carrying out the transactions contemplated hereby;   provided  ,   however  , that (a) such assignment shall be effective only if such Designated Purchaser provides Parent with written acceptance thereof, in form and substance acceptable to Parent, prior to the Closing Date and (b) Buyer  

shall be and remain jointly and severally liable for all obligations of Buyer and such Designated Purchaser under this Agreement and all Ancillary Agreements to be executed and delivered by Buyer or such Designated Purchaser pursuant hereto.    Section 5.6(a)   sets forth certain requirements applicable to any Designated Purchaser that purchases Shares of U.S. Holdco. 
  1.3        Equity Transfer Documents  .  The transfer of the Purchased Shares and the Specified Individual Shares will be effected at the Closing pursuant to transfer agreements substantially in the form attached as   Exhibit D   hereto, with only such modifications as required by applicable Law in the jurisdictions of incorporation or organization of the Companies (the    Equity Transfer Documents   ), and the parties shall execute any other forms, notarial deeds, instruments or other similar documents necessary pursuant to applicable Law to transfer the Purchased Shares and the Specified Individual Shares to Buyer or a Designated Purchaser (including any necessary notarizations, legalizations or other attestations and execution formalities to the extent required by applicable Law).  Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Individual Owners to execute any Ancillary Agreement required to transfer the Specified Individual Shares to the Companies, the Subsidiaries or Active Employees or, to the extent not so transferred prior to the Closing, at the Closing to Persons designated by Buyer, such Persons to be designated by Buyer at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in writing to Parent;   provided  ,   however  , for purposes of clarity, such transfers shall not be a condition to Buyer s obligation to otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to   Article VI   or otherwise. 
  1.4        Conflict or Inconsistency  .  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Equity Transfer Documents or any other Ancillary Agreement, Buyer and Parent agree, on behalf of themselves and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any Designated Purchaser or Seller, that the terms of this Agreement will govern with respect to any such conflict or inconsistency (and then only to the extent provided therein).  
  ARTICLE II        PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT 
  2.1        Purchase Price  .  The purchase price (the    Purchase Price   ) payable by Buyer in consideration for the Purchased Shares and the Specified Individual Shares shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures set forth in this   Article II   and   Exhibit A   and shall be an amount equal to (a) the Base Purchase Price, (b)   plus   the amount of Final Cash, (c)   plus   (solely in the event that the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Collar Ceiling) the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target or   minus   (solely in the event that the Collar Floor exceeds the Final Net Working Capital) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Final Net Working Capital, (d)   minus   the amount of Final Indebtedness and (e)   minus   the amount of Final Accrued Tax Liabilities (with each of clauses   (b)  ,   (c)  ,   (d)   and   (e)   determined in accordance with   Section 2.3(c)  ).

   2

Immediately prior to the Closing, Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (a) the Estimated Purchase Price to an account or accounts designated by Parent, at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in writing to Buyer and (b) the Debt Payoff Amount, if any, to the lenders of the Companies and the Subsidiaries in retirement of the related Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the applicable Payoff Letters.  All calculations of Indebtedness outstanding as of the Effective Time pursuant to this   Article II   shall disregard the effect of any payment made or to be made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

  (a)        Estimated Closing Statement  .  Not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (as updated pursuant to   Section 2.3(b)  , the    Estimated Closing Statement   ) setting forth Parent s good-faith estimate of each of the following, together with reasonably detailed documentation supporting each estimate: (i) the amount of Cash as of the Effective Time (the    Estimated Cash   ), (ii) the amount of Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the    Estimated Net Working Capital   ), (iii) the amount of Indebtedness as of the Effective Time (the    Estimated Indebtedness   ) and (iv) the amount of Accrued Tax Liabilities as of the Effective Time (the    Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities   ).  The Estimated Closing Statement shall also set forth the    Estimated Purchase Price  ,  which shall be equal to the sum of (A) the Base Purchase Price, (B)   plus   the Estimated Cash, (C)   plus   (solely in the event that the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Collar Ceiling) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target or   minus   (solely in the event that the Collar Floor exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, (D)   minus   the Estimated Indebtedness and (E)   minus   the Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities.

Based on Buyer s reasonable objections, Parent and Buyer will cooperate reasonably to update the initial Estimated Closing Statement delivered by Parent under   Section 2.3(a)   prior to the Closing Date.  In the event Buyer and Parent are unable to agree regarding any of the matters and/or amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement, such matters and amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by Parent pursuant to   Section 2.3(a)   shall be used for the purpose of the payment set forth in   Section 2.2  . 
  (c)        Post-Closing Reconciliation  . 
  (i)        No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the    Preliminary Closing Statement   ) setting forth Buyer s calculation of each of the following, together with reasonably detailed documentation supporting its calculation: (A) the amount of Cash as of the Effective Time, (B) the  
  
   3 

amount of Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, (C) the amount of Indebtedness as of the Effective Time and (D) the amount of Accrued Tax Liabilities as of the Effective Time. 
  (ii)        For the 30-day period following Parent s receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement (such 30-day period, the    Response Period   ), Buyer will cooperate, and will cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to cooperate, with Parent in the review of the Preliminary Closing Statement, including providing Parent and its representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the relevant books and records, including accounting work papers, pertaining to the Companies and the Subsidiaries and the finance employees of Buyer, the Companies and the Subsidiaries.  At any time before the end of the Response Period, Parent may deliver a written objection to the amounts set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement, specifying the item(s) and amount(s) in dispute, accompanied by materials showing in reasonable detail Parent s support for its position (such notice and supporting materials, the    Objection Notice   ), and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Preliminary Closing Statement. 
  (iii)        If Parent delivers an Objection Notice to Buyer within the Response Period, Buyer and Parent will meet within 15 days after the delivery of the Objection Notice to discuss each other s position and to attempt to resolve their differences.  If Buyer and Parent are not able to resolve their differences at such meeting (or by any later date that Buyer and Parent may mutually agree upon), Buyer and Parent will prepare a single list of the items that remain in dispute (the    Disputed Items    any items not set forth in the Disputed Items shall be deemed resolved, final and binding upon all of the parties hereto, and will be non-appealable and may be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Buyer and Parent will separately prepare statements (the    Position Statements   ) specifying in reasonable detail their respective positions on each of the Disputed Items (including the United States Dollar amount for each item).  Buyer and Parent will exchange their Position Statements within 30 days after the Disputed Items list was prepared (such 30-day period, the    Exchange Period   ). 
  (iv)        Following the end of the Exchange Period, either of Buyer or Parent may submit the Disputed Items (together with both Position Statements) to be resolved by Ernst   Young LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to perform the services required under this   Section 2.3(c)  , such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm as is mutually agreed to by Buyer and Parent (the    Accounting Firm   ), who shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator.  Regardless of whether Buyer or Parent submits the matter to the Accounting Firm for resolution, both Buyer and Parent will enter into the Accounting Firm s standard engagement letter and both will instruct the Accounting Firm to resolve each Disputed Item (but no other items) as soon as practicable, but in any event within 60 days of being engaged.  Buyer and Parent will cooperate with the Accounting Firm in all reasonable respects, but neither Buyer nor Parent will have ex parte meetings, teleconferences or other correspondence with the Accounting Firm, as it is intended for Buyer and Parent to be included in all discussions and correspondence with the Accounting Firm.  In resolving each Disputed Item, the Accounting Firm will not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for  
  
   4 

such item claimed by either Buyer or Parent or less than the least value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Parent (as each item had been disclosed by Buyer or Parent to the other in its respective Position Statement, as amended in the manner provided below).  If either Buyer or Parent fails to provide the other with its Position Statement within the Exchange Period or fails to enter into the Accounting Firm s standard engagement letter, the Accounting Firm must resolve every Disputed Item in the manner set forth in the opposing party s Position Statement. 
  (v)        If both Buyer and Parent present each other with their respective Position Statements within the Exchange Period, the Accounting Firm will schedule a hearing (which may occur on one or more Business Days) commencing on a Business Day within the 15-Business Day period following the end of the Exchange Period.  At the hearing, the Accounting Firm will be permitted to ask questions of Buyer and Parent with respect to either or both Position Statements, and Buyer and Parent will each have an opportunity to explain their respective Position Statements, as well as their respective objections to the opposing party s Position Statement.  All questions and explanations at the hearing will be conducted in a manner that Buyer and Parent are able to hear the responses and explanations of the other.  Following the hearing, the Accounting Firm will give Buyer and Parent 10 days (the    Amendment Period   ) to amend their respective Position Statements, if they desire, but if either party fails to deliver an amended Position Statement before the end of the Amendment Period, such party will be deemed to have elected not to amend its Position Statement.  When amending their respective Position Statements, neither Buyer nor Parent will be permitted to raise new items of dispute or new arguments not presented in such party s initial Position Statement or to revise the amount of any Disputed Item in a manner that increases the aggregate adjustment requested relative to such party s initial Position Statement.  The Accounting Firm will notify Buyer and Parent in writing of its determination of each Disputed Item, together with a reasonably detailed explanation of its determination of each Disputed Item, and, to the extent affected by the Accounting Firm s determination of the Disputed Item(s), its calculation of (A) the amount of Cash as of the Effective Time, (B) the amount of Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, (C) the amount of Indebtedness as of the Effective Time and (D) the amount of Accrued Tax Liabilities as of the Effective Time. 
  (vi)        The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid one half by Buyer and one half by Parent. 
  (vii)        The determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Disputed Items will be final and binding upon the parties hereto, will be non-appealable and may be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
  (viii)        The final amount of the Cash as of the Effective Time (the    Final Cash   ), the final amount of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the    Final Net Working Capital   ), the final amount of Indebtedness as of the Effective Time (the    Final Indebtedness   ) and the final amount of Accrued Tax Liabilities as of the Effective Time (the    Final Accrued Tax Liabilities   ) will be: 
  
   5 

(A)        As stated in the Preliminary Closing Statement, if Parent fails to deliver an Objection Notice with respect thereto during the Response Period; or 
  (B)        If Parent delivers an Objection Notice with respect thereto during the Response Period, (1) the amount mutually agreed to by Buyer and Parent or (2) in the absence of such agreement, the amount determined by the Accounting Firm computed by using the line items agreed to by Buyer and Parent (  i.e.  , the line items that are not Disputed Items) and each Disputed Item as resolved by the Accounting Firm;   provided   that in the case of the preceding clause (2) if either Buyer or Parent fails to provide the opposing party with its Position Statement or fails to enter into the Accounting Firm s standard engagement letter in the time periods specified under this   Section 2.3(c)  , then each Disputed Item will be as stated in the opposing party s Position Statement and the Final Cash, Final Net Working Capital, Final Indebtedness and Final Accrued Tax Liabilities, as applicable, will be determined on such basis. 
  The    Final Closing Statement    shall mean the Preliminary Closing Statement if Parent does not deliver any Objection Notice during the Response Period or the Preliminary Closing Statement as adjusted for the amounts determined pursuant to clause   (B)   if Parent delivers an Objection Notice during the Response Period. 
  (d)        Adjustment Payment to Buyer  .  In the event the Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Parent shall make an adjustment payment to Buyer in an amount equal to the difference of (i) the Estimated Purchase Price   minus   (ii) the Purchase Price.  Any payment required by the first sentence of this   Section 2.3(d)   shall be made by Parent to Buyer, together with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York based on such day s federal funds transactions by depositary institutions (as determined in such manner as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set forth on its public website from time to time) and published on the Closing Date by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the federal funds effective rate as of the Closing Date (the    Applicable Rate   ) calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the date of payment, in immediately available funds within five Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Statement. 
  (e)        Adjustment Payment to Parent  .  In the event the Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall make an adjustment payment to Parent in an amount equal to the difference of (i) the Purchase Price   minus   (ii) the Estimated Purchase Price.  Any payment required by the first sentence of this   Section 2.3(e)   shall be made by Buyer to Parent, together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the date of payment, in immediately available funds within five Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Statement. 
  2.4        Withholding  .  Buyer and each Designated Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld under any provision of applicable Law.  No less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall furnish to Parent such information regarding the amounts and types of Taxes to be deducted and withheld as may reasonably be requested by Parent.  Buyer and Parent shall  
  
   6 

reasonably cooperate with each other to minimize the amounts required to be deducted and withheld.  In the event that any withholding Taxes (with respect to amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement) arise solely by reason of the Designated Purchaser being incorporated in a jurisdiction other than (i) the United States or (ii) the jurisdiction in which the relevant Company or Seller is located, the Purchase Price shall be increased as necessary so that, after all such withholding Taxes have been imposed (including any such withholding Taxes that apply to additional sums payable under this sentence), Parent receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have received and retained had such withholding Taxes not been imposed.  If any Tax is withheld pursuant to this   Section 2.4  , the withheld amount shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable payee.  Within 30 days after the date of  payment by Buyer or the Designated Purchaser of any Taxes so withheld, Buyer or the Designated Purchaser, as the case may be, shall furnish to Parent evidence of payment thereof satisfactory to Parent.

  (bb)        Transferred Contracts  .  Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Contracts set forth on   Section 5.5(d) of the Disclosure Schedule   (each, a    Transferred Contract   ) to be assigned, transferred or conveyed, if so assignable, transferrable or conveyable, or appropriately amended prior to, on or after the Closing, so that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Companies and the Subsidiaries shall be entitled to the rights and benefits of and shall assume the liabilities under each Transferred Contract; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall any Person be required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part, any Transferred Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms without obtaining one or more consents from third parties and (ii) if any Shared Contract cannot be so assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be amended, without such consent or consents, then Parent and Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to establish an agency type or other similar arrangement as may be permitted by applicable Law so that

For any Company Guarantees for which Parent or its Affiliates (excluding the Companies and the Subsidiaries) is not substituted in all respects for the applicable Company Guarantor and for which the applicable Company Guarantor is not released effective as of the Closing, Parent shall continue using its reasonable best efforts to effect such substitution and release as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date.

   39 

Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement).  To the extent the amount of Taxes actually payable in respect of a Parent Pre-Closing Return due after the Closing Date is less than the amount reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) for such Taxes, then Buyer shall make a payment to Parent equal to the difference between the amount reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) for such Taxes and the amount of Taxes actually payable in respect of such Parent Pre-Closing Return no later than three days before the date on which payment is due in respect of such Taxes.

The parties agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of any such Parent Pre-Closing Return.  If Buyer reasonably believes that any position taken by Parent on any such Parent Pre-Closing Return could result in the assertion of penalties, Parent shall reflect any comments that Buyer reasonably believes are necessary to avoid the assertion of penalties unless Parent obtains a written opinion reasonably acceptable to Buyer, delivered for the benefit of the relevant Company or Subsidiary by an accounting or law firm nationally recognized as an expert in the relevant Tax matter, to the effect that such position is supported by substantial authority (or, if applicable, a standard under non-U.S. law that would avoid the imposition of penalties), provided that Buyer shall be responsible for up to the first $50,000 of the costs of each such opinion for each position and Parent shall be responsible for any costs of such opinion in excess of $50,000.  The final version of each Parent Pre-Closing Return that is due after the Closing Date shall be delivered by Parent to Buyer no less than five days prior to the due date for the filing of such Parent Pre-Closing Return; and Buyer shall arrange for the signing and timely filing of such Parent Pre-Closing Returns and cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to timely pay any Taxes that are actually payable in respect of such Parent Pre-Closing Returns.

Buyer shall cause all the shares of U.S. Holdco that are purchased pursuant to this Agreement to be purchased by a single Designated Purchaser that is a domestic corporation (within the meaning of Code Section 7701(a)), and Buyer shall cause both U.S. Holdco and such Designated Purchaser to be members of an affiliated group (as defined in Code Section 1504(a)) as of the close of business on the Closing Date.  Buyer shall cause such affiliated group to file a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax return for a period that includes the day immediately following the Closing Date, as a result of which Buyer and Parent agree and intend that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Closing Date shall constitute the end of a taxable period of U.S. Holdco.

With respect to any Buyer Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return (i) that is an income Tax return, Buyer shall, to the extent such Tax return could result in a Tax liability for which Parent would be responsible under this Agreement, reflect Parent s reasonable comments with respect to such Tax return, except to the extent that Buyer reasonably believes that the inclusion of such comments could result in the assertion of penalties, unless Parent obtains a written opinion reasonably acceptable to Buyer, delivered for the benefit of the relevant Company or Subsidiary by an accounting or law firm nationally recognized as an expert in the relevant Tax matter, to the effect that the position taken by such comments is supported by substantial authority (or, if applicable, a standard under non-U.S. law that would avoid the imposition of penalties), provided that Buyer shall be responsible for up to the first $50,000 of the costs of each such opinion for each position and Parent shall be responsible for any costs of such opinion in excess of $50,000, and (ii) that is not an income Tax return, Buyer shall consider Parent s reasonable comments with respect to such Tax return, as requested by Parent within 15 days after a draft of the Buyer Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return has been furnished to Parent.  The final version of each Buyer Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return shall be delivered by Buyer to Parent no less than five days prior to the due date for the filing of such Buyer Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return.  Parent shall pay to Buyer, no later than three days before the date on which payment is due in respect of such Taxes, (A) in the case of a Buyer Pre-Closing Return, an amount equal to the Taxes actually payable in respect of such Buyer Pre-Closing Return to the extent that such Taxes are not reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) or (B) in the case of a Straddle Return, an amount equal to the portion of the Taxes actually payable in respect of the Straddle Return that are allocable (under   Section 5.6(c)  ) to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date to the extent that such portion of such Taxes is not reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement).  To the extent the amount of Taxes actually payable in respect of a Buyer Pre-Closing Return is less than the amount reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) for such Taxes, then Buyer shall make a payment to Parent equal to the difference between the amount reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) for such Taxes and the amount of Taxes actually payable in respect of such Buyer Pre-Closing Return no later than three days before the date on which payment is due in respect of such Taxes.  To the extent the amount of the portion of the Taxes actually payable in respect of the Straddle Return that are allocable (under   Section 5.6(c)  ) to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date is less than the amount reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in  
  
   41 

Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) for such Taxes, then Buyer shall make a payment to Parent equal to the difference between the amount reflected in Final Accrued Tax Liabilities on the Final Closing Statement (or, if the Final Closing Statement has not yet been finalized, to the extent not reflected in Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities on the estimated Closing Statement) for such Taxes and the amount of the portion of the Taxes actually payable in respect of the Straddle Return that are allocable (under   Section 5.6(c)  ) to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date no later than three days before the date on which payment is due in respect of such Taxes.  Any payment made pursuant to the obligations in the immediately preceding three sentences shall be adjusted as necessary if the Final Accrued Tax Liabilities are different from the Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities.  Buyer shall arrange for the signing and timely filing of such Buyer Pre-Closing Returns and Straddle Returns and cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to timely pay any Taxes that are actually payable in respect of such Buyer Pre-Closing Returns and Straddle Returns.  Any original Buyer Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return shall not be amended without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).  Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, (i) all Buyer Pre-Closing Returns and Straddle Returns that are described in   Section 5.6(l) of the Disclosure Schedule   shall be prepared, and where applicable, payments in respect of such returns shall be made (but, for the avoidance of doubt, without limiting any obligation of any party under   Section 5.6(h)   or   Section 5.6(i)  ), in accordance with the procedures set forth therein; and (ii) all Buyer Pre-Closing Returns and Straddle Returns shall be prepared in accordance with existing practices and accounting methods of the Companies and the Subsidiaries,   provided   that Buyer may prepare in any manner permitted by Law any Buyer Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Return, so long as any inconsistency with existing practices and accounting methods does not increase the indemnification obligation of Parent pursuant to   Section 5.6(h)   and so long as any applicable procedures set forth in   Section 5.6(l) of the Disclosure Schedule   are followed. 
  (e)        Taxes Relating to Straddle Period  .  For purposes of determining the amount of Taxes that is allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date, the following provisions shall apply: 
  (v)        In the case of any Tax other than (i) a Tax based upon or related to income, receipts, wages, capital expenditures or expenses or (ii) a franchise Tax not based on income, the amount of Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of the Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. 
  (vi)        In the case of a franchise Tax not based on income, the amount of Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be equal to the amount of the franchise Tax for the entire Straddle Period that would have been imposed if such franchise Tax were determined based on the assets and liabilities of the Companies or the Subsidiaries as of the Closing, or the amount of the franchise Tax for the Straddle Period based on the number of shares of stock outstanding as of the Closing, whichever amount is applicable, in each case multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. 
  
   42 

(vii)        In the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, receipts, wages, capital expenditures or expenses, the amount of Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be deemed to equal the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period (of the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, and of any partnership or other  flowthrough  entity in which the Company or a Subsidiary holds, directly or indirectly, an interest) had ended on the Closing Date, using the  closing of the books  method of accounting;   provided  ,   however  , that all exemptions, allowances, or deductions for the entire Straddle Period which are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the two short periods in proportion to the number of days in each period.  Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. 
  (f)        Tax Contests  . 
  (i)        If any Government Entity issues to a Company or a Subsidiary a written notice of deficiency, or a written notice of its intent to audit, with respect to Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiary for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period (a    Tax Claim   ), Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within 30 days of the receipt of such written notice) notify Parent of its receipt of such written notice from the Government Entity;   provided  ,   however  , that any failure by Buyer to so notify Parent shall not relieve Parent of any of its indemnification obligations under   Section 5.6(h)  , except to the extent that Parent is materially and actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.  Parent shall have the right to control any audit, litigation or other proceeding in respect of a Tax Claim (a    Tax Contest   ) if the relevant taxable period ends on or prior to the Closing Date.  Buyer shall control (A) any other Tax Contest, including if the relevant taxable period is a Straddle Period, and (B) any Tax Contest if the relevant taxable period ends on or prior to the Closing Date if Parent does not elect to control such a Tax Contest. 
  (ii)        If a Tax Contest is controlled by Buyer: (A) Buyer shall control the Tax Contest in good faith; (B) subject to Parent s indemnification obligations under   Section 5.6(h)  , Buyer shall bear all of its costs in connection with such Tax Contest; (C) Buyer shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (D) Parent shall have the right, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, to participate in such Tax Contest (which right shall include the right to receive copies of all documents furnished or received by the applicable Company or Subsidiary in connection with the Tax Contest, the right to be involved, where practicable, in any oral communications between any representative of the Company or Subsidiary and the Government Entity, the right to be consulted about all significant decisions made on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary regarding the conduct of the Tax Contest, and the right to have a reasonable opportunity to provide input to the representatives of the Company or Subsidiary regarding all such significant decisions); and (E) without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not allow the applicable Company or Subsidiary to settle, resolve or abandon such Tax Contest (or any portion thereof) if such settlement, resolution or abandonment would  
  
   43 

result in Parent being required under this Agreement to make a payment in respect of Taxes or would result in a reduction in any Tax asset of Parent or its Affiliates. 
  (iii)        If a Tax Contest is controlled by Parent: (A) Parent shall control the Tax Contest in good faith; (B) subject to Buyer s indemnification obligations under   Section 5.6(i),     Parent shall bear all of its costs in connection with such Tax Contest; (C) Parent shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (D) Buyer, at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, shall have the right to participate, or cause the applicable Company or Subsidiary to participate, in such Tax Contest (which right shall include the right to receive copies of all documents furnished or received by Parent in connection with the Tax Contest, the right to be involved in any oral communications, where practicable, between any representative of Parent and the Government Entity, the right to be consulted about all significant decisions made on behalf of Parent regarding the conduct of the Tax Contest, and the right to have a reasonable opportunity to provide input to the representatives of Parent regarding all such significant decisions); and (E) without Buyer s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not settle, resolve or abandon (or allow the applicable Company or Subsidiary to settle, resolve, or abandon) the Tax Contest (or any portion thereof) if such settlement, resolution or abandonment could adversely impact Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) with respect to a taxable period ending after the Closing Date. 
  (iv)        In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this   Section 5.6(d)   and the provisions of   Article IX  , the provisions of this   Section 5.6(d)   shall control. 
  (g)        Cooperation  .  After the Closing Date, each party to this Agreement shall: (i) make available to the other party, as reasonably requested, and to any Tax authority (which such authority is legally permitted to receive pursuant to its subpoena power or its equivalent) all information, records, or documents that are possessed by the cooperating party and that relate to Tax liabilities of the Companies and the Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date or for Straddle Periods; and (ii) preserve all such information, records, and documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations for assessment or refund of Taxes or extensions thereof.  After the Closing Date, Buyer shall make available to Parent, at such times and under such circumstances so as not to unreasonably disrupt business, the relevant personnel of Buyer and its Affiliates to assist Parent in connection with the preparation of Parent Pre-Closing Returns or participation in a Tax Contest, and Buyer shall take all such action (including the execution and delivery of documents and instruments, and the execution of powers of attorney) as Parent reasonably requests in connection with any Parent Pre-Closing Returns or Tax Contests;   provided  ,   however  , that Parent shall promptly reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs directly relating to such cooperation of any of the personnel of Buyer or its Affiliates who assist Parent.  Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall exercise all of its rights under the Pentair-Tyco TSA to obtain from Parent s counterparties under such tax sharing agreement any information reasonably requested by Buyer, including any information, records or documents Buyer may request to assist in determining the overall foreign losses and separate limitation losses associated with the Companies and the Subsidiaries.

   45

For this purpose, the indemnified party shall be deemed to realize a Tax benefit with respect to a taxable year as a result of such Loss if, and to the extent that, the indemnified party s cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the Loss from all taxable years, exceeds the indemnified party s actual cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items relating to such Loss for all taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year).  The amounts of Tax benefits realized or to be realized shall be determined in good faith by the indemnified party, and information regarding this determination shall be promptly furnished by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party in as much detail as reasonably requested by the indemnifying party.

Not later than 30 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer for its review a schedule that allocates, in a manner consistent with and based upon the Preliminary Allocation, the Estimated Purchase Price among the Shares of the various Companies for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) (the    Final Allocation   ).  The parties agree that any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to   Section 2.3   shall be reflected through the allocation amount assigned to the Shares of one or more Companies designated in the Preliminary Allocation and need not be allocated among the Shares of all of the Companies, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.  If, within 30 days after Parent delivers the Final Allocation to Buyer, Buyer does not provide a written objection to the Final Allocation, the Final Allocation shall be considered to have been approved by Buyer.  If, within 30 days after Parent delivers the Final Allocation to Buyer, Buyer provides a written objection to the Final Allocation, Parent and Buyer shall follow reconciliation procedures similar to those described in   Section 2.3(c)   and, if necessary, shall submit the dispute to the Accounting Firm.  Unless required by applicable Law, and notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary herein, the parties agree that any adjustment payment made by either party pursuant to   Section 2.3   shall be made between Parent and Buyer.

transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the  Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter  described in IRS Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111. 
  (q)        Equity Award Deductions  .  In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates actually realizes a reduction in income Tax liability as a result of any Equity Award Deductions in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or in the portion of a Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Parent, within 30 days after the date on which such reduction in income Tax liability is actually recognized, an amount equal to such reduction, net of the employer share of any employment or other payroll Taxes that are the liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates and that are attributable to the vesting of any restricted share units or performance share units or the exercise of any options giving rise to such Equity Award Deductions;   provided   that Buyer s obligation to pay amounts to Parent pursuant to this   Section 5.6(o)   shall not apply to any reduction in income Tax liability realized by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in a taxable year beginning more than five years after the Closing Date.  For this purpose, Buyer or the applicable Affiliate shall be deemed to realize a reduction in income Tax liability as a result of an Equity Award Deduction if, and to the extent that, the cumulative liability for Taxes of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding such Equity Award Deduction, exceeds the actual cumulative liability for Taxes of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account such Equity Award Deduction (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such Equity Award Deduction as the last item claimed for the applicable taxable year).  Buyer shall promptly furnish Parent with such information regarding the amounts of Equity Award Deductions as is reasonably requested by Parent.  All determinations regarding the amount of income Tax liability, and the amount of any reductions in income Tax liability, for purposes of this   Section 5.6(o)   shall be made by Buyer in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith.  If, after the payment by Buyer to Parent of any amount under this   Section 5.6(o)  , there shall be a final determination which reduces the amount of the reduction in any income Tax liability which gave rise to such payment, as determined pursuant to this   Section 5.6(o)   taking into account such final determination, Parent shall repay to Buyer, within 90 days after such final determination, any amount which would not have been payable to Parent pursuant to this   Section 5.6(o)   had such reduction in income Tax liability been determined taking into account such final determination.

If Buyer or any of its Affiliates actually realizes a reduction in income Tax liability in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or in the portion of a Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date as a result of the use of any Specified Carryforwards, Buyer shall deliver to Parent, within 30 days after the date on which such reduction in income Tax liability is actually realized, an amount equal to such reduction;   provided   that Buyer s obligation to pay amounts to Parent pursuant to this   Section 5.6(p)   shall not apply to any reduction in income Tax liability recognized by Buyer or its Affiliates in a taxable period beginning more than seven years after the Closing Date.  For this purpose, Buyer or the applicable Affiliate shall be deemed to realize a reduction in Tax liability with respect to a taxable year as a result of the use of a Specified Carryforward if, and to the extent that, the cumulative liability for Taxes of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding the Specified Carryforward, exceeds the actual cumulative liability for Taxes of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account the Specified Carryforward (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such carryforward as the last item claimed for the applicable taxable year).  All determinations regarding the amount of income Tax liability, and the amount of any reductions in income Tax liability, for purposes of this   Section 5.6(p)   shall be made by Buyer in its reasonable  
  
   48 

discretion exercised in good faith.  If, after the payment by Buyer to Parent of any amount under this   Section 5.6(p)  , there shall be a final determination which reduces the amount of the reduction in any income Tax liability which gave rise to such payment, as determined pursuant to this   Section 5.6(p)   taking into account such final determination, Parent shall repay to Buyer, within 90 days of such final determination, any amount which would not have been payable to Parent pursuant to this   Section 5.6(p)   had such reduction in income Tax liability been determined taking into account such final determination.

Section 5.7(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule   separately identifies the Mixed Foreign Retirement Plans sponsored by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than any Company or Subsidiary) (the    Parent Sponsored Mixed Foreign Retirement Plans   ) and the Mixed Foreign Retirement Plans sponsored by any Company or Subsidiary (the    Company Sponsored Mixed Foreign Retirement Plans   ).  Where a pension plan has not been listed as a Mixed Foreign Retirement Plan in   Section 5.7(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule   but either Buyer or Parent identifies to the other in writing that it is, as a matter of fact, a Mixed Foreign Retirement Plan, then the provisions of this   Section 5.7(a)(ii)   shall, if Buyer directs, apply equally to such plans.

The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

    Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the Holders of any existing shares or class of shares, any share in the Company may be issued with such preferred or deferred or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise, as the Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution determine. 
              6. 
    (a)    Subject to the provisions of these articles relating to new shares, the shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors, and they may (subject to the provisions of the Acts) allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, on such terms and conditions and at such times as they may consider to be in the best interests of the Company and its members, but so that no share shall be issued at a discount save in accordance   the Acts  , and so that, in the case of shares offered to the public for subscription, the amount payable on application on each share shall not be less than one-quarter of the nominal amount of the share and the whole of any premium thereon. 
              (b) 
    Subject to any requirement to obtain the approval of members under any laws, regulations or the rules of any stock exchange to which the Company is subject, the Board is authorised, from time to time, in its discretion, to grant such persons, for such periods and upon such terms as the Board deems advisable, options to purchase or subscribe for such number of shares of any class or classes or of any series of any class as the Board may deem advisable, and to cause warrants or other appropriate instruments evidencing such options to be issued. 
              (c) 
    The Directors are, for the purposes of the   Acts  , generally and unconditionally authorised to exercise all powers of the Company to allot and issue relevant securities (as defined by the   Acts  ) up to the amount of Company s authorised share capital and to allot and issue any shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the   Acts   and held as treasury shares and this authority shall expire five years from the date of adoption of these articles.       The Company may before the expiry of such authority make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such an offer or agreement notwithstanding that the authority hereby conferred has expired. 
              (d) 
    The Directors are hereby empowered pursuant to the   Acts   to allot equity securities within the meaning of the   Acts   for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by paragraph (c) of this article as if the   Acts   did not apply to any such allotment. The Company may before the expiry of such authority make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the power conferred by this paragraph (d) had not expired. 
              (e) 
    Nothing in these articles shall preclude the Directors from recognising a renunciation of the allotment of any shares by any allottee in favour of some other person. 
              7. 
    The Company may pay commission to any person in consideration of a person subscribing or agreeing to subscribe, whether absolutely or conditionally, for any shares in the Company or procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions, whether absolute or conditional, for any shares in the Company on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Directors may determine, including, without limitation, by paying cash or allotting and issuing fully or partly paid shares or any combination of the two. The Company may also, on any issue of shares, pay such brokerage as may be lawful. 
              8. 
    Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon any trust, and the Company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable,  

5 

contingent, future or partial interest in any share or any interest in any fractional part of a share or (except only as by these articles or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the Holder. 
           9. 
    No person shall be entitled to a share certificate in respect of any ordinary share held by them in the share capital of the Company, whether such ordinary share was allotted or transferred to them, and the Company shall not be bound to issue a share certificate to any such person entered in the Register. 
              10. 
    The Company shall not give, whether directly or indirectly and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person of or for any shares in the Company or in its holding company, except as permitted by the   Acts  . 
              11. 
    (a)    The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) payable at a fixed time or called in respect of that share.  The Directors, at any time, may declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this article. The Company s lien on a share shall extend to all moneys payable in respect of it. 
              (b) 
    The Company may sell in such manner as the Directors determine any share on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within fourteen Clear Days after notice demanding payment, and stating that if the notice is not complied with the share may be sold, has been given to the Holder of the share or to the person entitled to it by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the Holder. 
              (c) 
    To give effect to a sale, the Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share sold to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser.  The transferee shall be entered in the Register as the Holder of the share comprised in any such transfer and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase moneys nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale, and after the name of the transferee has been entered in the Register, the remedy of any person aggrieved by the sale shall be in damages only and against the Company exclusively. 
              (d) 
    The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is presently payable and any residue (upon surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate for the shares sold and subject to a like lien for any moneys not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) shall be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale. 
              12. 
    (a)    Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares and each member (subject to receiving at least fourteen Clear Days  notice specifying when and where payment is to be made) shall pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on his shares.  A call may be required to be paid by instalments.  A call may be revoked before receipt by the Company of a sum due thereunder, in whole or in part and payment of a call may be postponed in whole or in part.  A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was made. 
              (b) 
    A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 
              (c) 
    The joint Holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
              (d) 
    If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day it became due until it is paid at the rate fixed by the terms of  

6 

allotment of the share or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, at the appropriate rate (as defined by the Acts) but the Directors may waive payment of the interest wholly or in part. 
           (e) 
    An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid the provisions of these articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call. 
              (f) 
    Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the Holders in the amounts and times of payment of calls on their shares. 
              (g) 
    The Directors, if they think fit, may receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced may pay (until the same would, but for such advance, become payable) interest at such rate, not exceeding (unless the Company in general meeting otherwise directs) 15% per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the member paying such sum in advance. 
              (h) 
    (i)    If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the Directors, at any time thereafter and during such times as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid, may serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued. 
              (ii) 
    The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of fourteen Clear Days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. 
              (iii) 
    If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with then, at any time thereafter before the payment required by the notice has been made, any shares in respect of which the notice has been given may be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect. The forfeiture shall include all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited shares and not paid before forfeiture. The Directors may accept a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder. 
              (iv) 
    On the trial or hearing of any action for the recovery of any money due for any call it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the member sued is entered in the Register as the Holder, or one of the Holders, of the shares in respect of which such debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the minute book and that notice of such call was duly given to the member sued, in pursuance of these articles, and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment of the Directors who made such call nor any other matters whatsoever, but the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt. 
              (i) 
    A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit.  Where for the purposes of its disposal such a share is to be transferred to any person, the Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person.  The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on any sale or disposition thereof and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of and thereupon he shall be registered as the Holder of the share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share. 

7 

(j) 
    A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares, but nevertheless shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which, at the date of forfeiture, were payable by him to the Company in respect of the shares, without any deduction or allowance for the value of the shares at the time of forfeiture but his liability shall cease if and when the Company shall have received payment in full of all such moneys in respect of the shares. 
              (k) 
    A statutory declaration that the declarant is a Director or the Secretary of the Company, and that a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on the date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share. 
              (l) 
    The provisions of these articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 
              (m) 
    The Directors may accept the surrender of any share which the Directors have resolved to have been forfeited upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed and, subject to any such terms and conditions, a surrendered share shall be treated as if it has been forfeited. 
     TRANSFER OF SHARES 
           13. 
    (a)    The instrument of transfer of any share may be executed for and on behalf of the transferor by the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or any such person that the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary nominates for that purpose (whether in respect of specific transfers or pursuant to a general standing authorisation), and the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or the relevant nominee shall be deemed to have been irrevocably appointed agent for the transferor of such share or shares with full power to execute, complete and deliver in the name of and on behalf of the transferor of such share or shares all such transfers of shares held by the members in the share capital of the Company. Any document which records the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, the class and number of shares agreed to be transferred, the date of the agreement to transfer shares and the price per share, shall, once executed by the transferor or the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or the relevant nominee as agent for the transferor, be deemed to be a proper instrument of transfer for the purposes of the   Acts  . The transferor shall be deemed to remain the Holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered on the Register in respect thereof, and neither the title of the transferee nor the title of the transferor shall be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale should the Directors so determine. 
              (b) 
    The Company, at its absolute discretion, may, or may procure that a subsidiary of the Company shall, pay Irish stamp duty arising on a transfer of shares on behalf of the transferee of such shares of the Company. If stamp duty resulting from the transfer of shares in the Company which would otherwise be payable by the transferee is paid by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company on behalf of the transferee, then in those circumstances, the Company shall, on its behalf or on behalf of its subsidiary (as the case may be), be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement of the stamp duty from the transferee, (ii) set-off the stamp duty against any dividends payable to the transferee of those shares and (iii) claim a first and permanent lien on the shares on which stamp duty has been paid by the Company or its subsidiary for the amount of stamp duty paid. The Company s lien shall extend to all dividends paid on those shares.  
              (c) 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of these articles and subject to any regulations made under section 239 of the   Companies Act 1990 or section 1086 of the Companies   Act, title to any shares in the Company may also be evidenced and transferred without a written instrument in accordance with   regulations made under   section 239 of the   Companies   Act   1990 or section 1086 of the Companies Act  . The Directors shall have power to permit any class of shares to be held in uncertificated form and to implement any arrangements they think fit for such evidencing and transfer which accord with such regulations and in particular shall, where appropriate, be entitled  

8 

to disapply or modify all or part of the provisions in these articles with respect to the requirement for written instruments of transfer and share certificates (if any), in order to give effect to such regulations. 
           14. 
    Subject to such of the restrictions of these articles and to such of the conditions of issue of any share warrants as may be applicable, the shares of any member and any share warrant   permitted to be issued by the Acts   may be transferred by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or any other form which the Directors may approve. 
              15. 
    (a)    The Directors in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor may decline to register: 
              (i) 
    any transfer of a share which is not fully paid; or 
              (ii) 
    any transfer to or by a minor or person of unsound mind;  
     but this shall not apply to a transfer of such a share resulting from a sale of the share through a stock exchange on which the share is listed. 
           (c) 
    The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless: 
              (i) 
    the instrument of transfer is accompanied by any evidence the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; 
              (ii) 
    the instrument of transfer is in respect of one class of share only; 
              (iii) 
    the instrument of transfer is in favour of not more than four transferees; and  
              (iv) 
    it is lodged at the Office or at such other place as the Directors may appoint. 
              16. 
    If the Directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to the transferee notice of the refusal. 
              17. 
    (a)    The Directors may from time to time fix a record date for the purposes of determining the rights of members to notice of and/or to vote at any general meeting of the Company. The record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Directors, and the record date shall be not more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Directors, the record date for determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the members shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given. Unless the Directors determine otherwise, a determination of members of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall apply to any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. 
              (b) 
    In order that the Directors may determine the members entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of shares, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining members for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Directors adopt the resolution relating thereto. 
              18. 
    Registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such period, not exceeding in the whole 30 days in each year, as the Directors may from time to time determine subject to the requirements of the   Acts  . 

9 

19. 
    All instruments of transfer shall upon their being lodged with the Company remain the property of the Company and the Company shall be entitled to retain them. 
              20. 
    Subject to the provisions of these articles, whenever as a result of a consolidation of shares or otherwise any members would become entitled to fractions of a share, the Directors may sell or cause to be sold, on behalf of those members, the shares representing the fractions for the best price reasonably obtainable to any person and distribute the proceeds of sale (subject to any applicable tax and abandoned property laws) in due proportion among those members, and the Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser.  The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale. 
              21. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of these articles and subject to any CSD Regulation or any regulations made under section 239 of the   Companies Act 1990 or section 1086 of the Companies   Act, title to any shares in the Company may also be evidenced and transferred without a written instrument in accordance with any CSD Regulation or section 239 of the   Companies Act 1990 or section 1086 of the Companies   Act or any regulations made thereunder.  The Directors shall have power to permit any class of shares to be held in uncertificated form and to implement any arrangements they think fit for such evidencing and transfer which accord with such regulations and in particular shall, where appropriate, be entitled to disapply or modify all or part of the provisions in these articles with respect to the requirement for written instruments of transfer and share certificates, in order to give effect to such regulations. 
     TRANSMISSION OF SHARES 
           22. 
    In the case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint Holder, and the personal representatives of the deceased where he was a sole Holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint Holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons. 
              23. 
    Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the Directors and subject as herein provided, elect either to be registered himself as Holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof, but the Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the shares by that member before his death or bankruptcy, as the case may be. 
              24. 
    If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he elects to have another person registered, he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these regulations relating to the right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred and the notice of transfer were a transfer signed by that member. 
              25. 
    A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the Holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered Holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to the meetings of the Company, so, however, that the Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share, and if the notice is not complied with within 90 days, the Directors may thereupon withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other moneys payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. 

10 

ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 
           26. 
    The Company may from time to time by Variation Resolution increase the authorised share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such amount, as the resolution shall prescribe. 
              27. 
    The Company may by Ordinary Resolution: 
              (a) 
    consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares; 
              (b) 
    subdivide its existing shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the memorandum of association subject, nevertheless, to the A  cts  ; or 
              (c) 
    cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and reduce the amount of its authorised share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled. 
              28. 
    The Company may by Special Resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve fund or any share premium account in any manner and with and subject to any incident authorised, and consent required, by law. 
     GENERAL MEETINGS 
           29. 
    The Company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meeting in that year, and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it. Not more than fifteen months shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of the Company and that of the next.  This article shall not apply in the case of the first general meeting, in respect of which the Company shall convene the meeting within the time periods required by the Act. 
              30. 
    Subject to the   Acts  , all general meetings of the Company may be held outside of Ireland. 
              31. 
    All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary general meetings. 
              32. 
    The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting, and extraordinary general meetings shall also be convened on such requisition, or in default may be convened by such requisitionists, as provided in the   Acts  . 
              33. 
    All provisions of these articles relating to general meetings of the Company shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to every separate general meeting of the Holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, except that: 
              (a) 
    the necessary quorum shall be such person or persons holding or representing by proxy (whether or not such Holder actually exercises his voting rights in whole, in part or at all at the relevant general meeting) at least a majority in nominal value of the issued shares of the class, shall be deemed to constitute a meeting; 
              (b) 
    any Holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll; and 
              (c) 
    on a poll, each Holder of shares of the class shall have one vote in respect of every share of the class held by him. 
              34. 
    A Director shall be entitled, notwithstanding that he is not a member, to attend and speak at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the Holders of any class of shares in the Company. 
     NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS 
           35. 
    (a)    Subject to the provisions of the Acts allowing a general meeting to be called by shorter notice, an annual general meeting and an extraordinary general meeting shall be called by not less than 21 Clear Days  notice. 

11 

(b) 
    Any notice convening a general meeting shall specify the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of that business and, in reasonable prominence, that a member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote in his place and that a proxy need not be a member of the Company. It shall also give particulars of any Directors who are to retire at the meeting and of any persons who are recommended by the Directors for appointment or re-appointment as Directors at the meeting or in respect of whom notice has been duly given to the Company of the intention to propose them for appointment or re-appointment as Directors at the meeting. Provided that the latter requirement shall only apply where the intention to propose the person has been received by the Company in accordance with the provisions of these articles. Subject to any restrictions imposed on any shares, the notice of the meeting shall be given to all the members of the Company as of the record date set by the Directors and to the Directors and the   statutory auditors  . 
              (c) 
    The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at the meeting. 
              36. 
    Where, by any provision contained in the Acts, extended notice is required of a resolution, the resolution shall not be effective (except where the Directors of the Company have resolved to submit it) unless notice of the intention to move it has been given to the Company not less than twenty-eight days (or such shorter period as the Acts permit) before the meeting at which it is moved, and the Company shall give to the members notice of any such resolution as required by and in accordance with the provisions of the Acts. 
     PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 
           37. 
    All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting and also that is transacted at an annual general meeting, with the exception of  : 
              (a) 
    the consideration of the Company s statutory financial statements and the report of the directors and the report of the statutory auditors on those statements and that report; 
              (b) 
    the review by the members of the Company s affairs; 
              (c) 
    the declaration of a dividend (if any) of an amount not exceeding the amount recommended by the directors; 
              (d) 
    the authorisation of the directors to approve the remuneration of the statutory auditors; 
              (e) 
    the election and re-election of directors; and

           39. 
    At any extraordinary general meeting of the members, only such business shall be conducted or considered, as shall have been properly brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company s notice of meeting.

              41. 
    Except as otherwise provided by law, the memorandum of association or these articles, the Chairman of any general meeting shall have the power to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the general meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with these articles and, if any proposed nomination or other business is not in compliance with these articles, to declare that no action shall be taken on such nomination or other proposal and such nomination or other proposal shall be disregarded. 
              42. 
    No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business. The Holders of shares, present in person or by proxy (whether or not such Holder actually exercises his voting rights in whole, in part or at all at the relevant general meeting), entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Company on the relevant record date shall constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be regarded as present for the purposes of establishing the presence of a quorum. 
              43. 
    Any general meeting duly called at which a quorum not present shall be adjourned and the Company shall provide notice pursuant to article 35 in the event that such meeting is to be reconvened. 
              44.

              45. 
    If at any meeting no Director is willing to act as Chairman or if no Director is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the members present shall choose one of their number to be Chairman of the meeting. 
              46. 
    The Chairman shall have all powers and authority necessary and appropriate to ensure the orderly conduct of the general meeting, including the power and authority to adjourn the meeting. The Chairman of the meeting may at any time without the consent of the meeting adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place if, in his opinion, it would facilitate the conduct of the business of the meeting to do so or if he is so directed by the Board. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. 

13 

47. 
    At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a poll. The Board or the Chairman may determine the manner in which the poll is to be taken and the manner in which the votes are to be counted.   For avoidance of doubt, no resolution of the members may be passed as written resolution under the Acts or otherwise. 
              48. 
    A poll demanded on the election of the Chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken at such time as the Chairman of the meeting directs, and any business other than that on which the poll has been demanded may be proceeded with pending the taking of the poll. 
              49. 
    No notice need be given of a poll not taken immediately. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the general meeting at which the poll was demanded.

class or series of shares of the Company, whether or not such instrument, contract or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of shares of the Company, through the delivery of cash or other property, or otherwise, and without regard to whether the member, the Beneficial Owner or Beneficial Owners, if any, or any affiliates or associates or others acting in

              57.

              58. 
    With respect to each person, if any, whom the member proposes to nominate for election or re-election to the Board, a member s notice must, in addition to the matters set forth in articles 55 and 57 above, also include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by article 61. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable member s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. 
              59. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of these articles, a member shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in articles 50-61; provided, however, that any references in these articles to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the separate and additional requirements set forth in these articles with respect to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to articles 37-41. 
              60. 
    Nothing in these articles shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of members to request inclusion of proposals in the Company s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (b) of members of the Company to bring business before an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to the valid exercise of power granted to them under the Acts.

  VOTES OF MEMBERS 
           62. 
    Subject to article 64 and any special rights or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached by or in accordance with these articles to any class of shares, on a poll every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for each share of which he is the Holder. 
              63. 
    When there are joint Holders, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint Holders; and for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register. 
              64. 
    (a)    A member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction (whether in Ireland or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder, may vote, by his committee, receiver, guardian or other person appointed by that court and any such committee, receiver, guardian or other person may vote by proxy. Evidence to the satisfaction of the Directors of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote shall be received at the Office or at such other address as is specified in accordance with these articles for the receipt of appointments of proxy, not less than forty-eight hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised and in default the right to vote shall not be exercisable. 
              (b) 
    If the Company is listed on any foreign stock exchange the Company shall be permitted to comply with the relevant rules and regulations (if any) that are applied in that jurisdiction with regard to this article 64, notwithstanding anything contained in this article 64. 
              (c)  
     No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered, and every vote not disallowed at such meeting shall be valid for all purposes. Any such objection made in due time shall be referred to the Chairman of the meeting, whose decision shall be final and conclusive. 
              65. 
    Votes may be given either personally or by proxy. 
              66. 
    (a)    Every member entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. The appointment of a proxy shall be in any form   consistent with the Acts   which the Directors may approve and, if required by the Company, shall be signed by or on behalf of the appointor. In relation to written proxies, a body corporate may sign a form of proxy under its common seal or under the hand  

17 

of a duly authorised officer thereof or in such other manner as the Directors may approve. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. The appointment of a proxy in electronic or other form shall only be effective in such manner as the Directors may approve.   An instrument of other form of communication appointing or evidencing the appointment of a proxy or a corporate representative (other than a standing proxy or representative) together with such evidence as to its due execution as the board may from time to time require, may be returned to the address or addresses stated in the notice of meeting or adjourned meeting or any other information or communication by such time or times as may be specified in the notice of meeting or adjourned meeting or in any other such information or communication (which times may differ when more than one place is so specified) or, if no such time is specified, at any time prior to the holding of the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting at which the appointee proposes to vote, and, subject to the Acts, if not so delivered the appointment shall not be treated as valid. 
           (b) 
    Without limiting the foregoing, the Directors may from time to time permit appointments of a proxy to be made by means of an electronic or internet communication or facility and may in a similar manner permit supplements to, or amendments or revocations of, any such electronic or internet communication or facility to be made. The Directors may in addition prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such electronic or internet communication or facility is to be treated as received by the Company. The Directors may treat any such electronic or internet communication or facility which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a Holder of a share as sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending that instruction to send it on behalf of that Holder. 
              (c) 
    Without limiting the foregoing, in relation to any shares which are held in uncertificated form, the Directors may from time to time permit appointments of a proxy to be made by means of electronic communication in the form of an Uncertificated Proxy Instruction, (that is, a properly authenticated dematerialised instruction, and or other instruction or notification, which is sent by means of the relevant system concerned and received by such participant in that system acting on behalf of the Company as the Directors may prescribe in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as may from time to time be prescribed by the Directors (subject always to the facilities and requirements of the relevant system concerned)); and may in a similar manner permit supplements to, or amendments or revocations of, any such Uncertificated Proxy Instruction to be made by like means. The Directors may in addition prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such properly authenticated dematerialised instruction (and or other instruction or notification) is to be treated as received by the Company or such participant. The Directors may treat any such Uncertificated Proxy Instruction which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a Holder of a share as sufficient evidence of the authority of a person sending that instruction to send it on behalf of that Holder. 
              67. 
    Any body corporate which is a member of the Company may authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of members of the Company and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the body corporate which he represents as that body corporate could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company. The Company may require evidence from the body corporate of the due authorisation of such person to act as the representative of the relevant body corporate. 
              68. 
    An appointment of proxy relating to more than one meeting (including any adjournment thereof) having once been received by the Company for the purposes of any meeting shall not require to be delivered, deposited or received again by the Company for the purposes of any subsequent meeting to which it relates. 
              69. 
    Receipt by the Company of an appointment of proxy in respect of a meeting shall not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting or at any adjournment thereof. An appointment proxy shall be valid, unless the contrary is stated therein, as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates. 

18 

70. 
    (a)    A vote given in accordance with the terms of an appointment of proxy or a resolution authorising a representative to act on behalf of a body corporate shall be valid notwithstanding the death or insanity of the principal, or the revocation of the appointment of proxy or of the authority under which the proxy was appointed or of the resolution authorising the representative to act or transfer of the share in respect of which the proxy was appointed or the authorisation of the representative to act was given, provided that no intimation in writing (whether in electronic form or otherwise) of such death, insanity, revocation or transfer shall have been received by the Company at the Office, before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the appointment of proxy is used or at which the representative acts; provided, however, that where such intimation is given in electronic form it shall have been received by the Company at least 24 hours (or such lesser time as the Directors may specify) before the commencement of the meeting. 
              (b) 
    The Directors may send, at the expense of the Company, by post, electronic mail or otherwise, to the members forms for the appointment of a proxy (with or without stamped envelopes for their return) for use at any general meeting or at any class meeting, either in blank or nominating any one or more of the Directors or any other persons in the alternative. 
     DIRECTORS 
           71. 
    Subject to article   93,   the number of Directors shall not be less than nine (the    prescribed minimum   ) nor more than twelve and shall be determined by the Board (the    Authorised Number   ). The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body provided that, if the number of the Directors is reduced below the prescribed minimum, the remaining Director or Directors shall appoint forthwith an additional Director or additional Directors so that the Board comprises such minimum or shall convene a general meeting of the Company for the purpose of making such appointment. If, at any general meeting of the Company, (a) the Chairman determines that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as Directors exceeds the Authorised Number and (b) the number of Directors is reduced below the Authorised Number due to the failure of one or more Directors to be elected or re-elected (as the case may be) by way of a majority of the votes cast at that meeting or any adjournment thereof, then from the persons properly nominated to serve as Directors those receiving the highest number of votes in favour of election or re-election (as the case may be) shall be elected or re-elected (as the case may be ) to the Board so that the number of Directors equals the Authorised Number and shall be Directors until the next annual general meeting. Where the number of Directors falls to less than the Authorised Number and there are no Director or Directors capable of acting then any two members may summon a general meeting for the purpose of appointing Directors. Any additional Director so appointed shall hold office (subject to the provisions of the Acts and these articles) only until the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company next following such appointment. If, at any meeting of the Company, resolutions are passed by a majority of the votes cast at that meeting or any adjournment thereof in respect of the election or re-election (as the case may be) of Directors which would result in the Authorised Number being exceeded, then those Director(s), in such number as exceeds such Authorised Number, receiving at that meeting  the lowest number of votes in favour of election or re-election (as the case may be) shall, notwithstanding the passing of any resolution by a majority of the votes cast at that meeting or any adjournment thereof  in their favour, not be elected or re-elected (as the case may be) to the Board; provided, that nothing in this provision will require or result in the removal of a Director whose election or re-election to the Board was not voted on at such meeting. 
              72. 
    Each Director shall be entitled to receive as compensation for such Director s services as a Director or committee member or for attendance at meetings of the Board or committees, or both, such amounts (if any) as shall be fixed from time to time by the Board or a committee. Each Director shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable traveling expenses incurred by such Director in attending any such meeting.  
              73. 
    The Board or a committee may from time to time determine that, all or part of any fees or other compensation payable to any Director shall be provided in the form of shares or other securities of the Company or any subsidiary of the  

19 

Company, or options or rights to acquire such shares or other securities (including, without limitation, deferred stock units), on such terms as the Board or a committee may determine.  
           74. 
    No shareholding qualification for Directors shall be required. A Director (whether or not a member of the Company) shall be entitled to attend and speak at general meetings. 
              75. 
    Unless the Company otherwise directs, a Director of the Company may be or become a Director or other officer of, or otherwise interested in, any company promoted by the Company or in which the Company may be interested as Holder or otherwise, and no such Director shall be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or other benefits received by him as a Director or officer of, or from his interest in, such other company.

     POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DIRECTORS 
           77. 
    The business of the Company shall be managed by the Directors, who may pay all expenses incurred in promoting and registering the Company and may exercise all such powers of the Company as are not, by the Acts or by these articles, required to be exercised by the Company in general meeting, subject, nevertheless, to any of these articles and to the provisions of the Acts.  
              78. 
    The Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney appoint any company, firm or person or body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection of persons dealing with any such attorney as the Directors may think fit, and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him.     
              79.

20 

83.

              84. 
    Any Director may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company, and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director, but nothing herein contained shall authorise a Director or his firm to act as   statutory   auditor to the Company.

              86.

    All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all receipts for money paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the case may be, by such person or persons and in such manner as the Directors shall from time to time by resolution determine.

     DISQUALIFICATION OF DIRECTORS 
           90. 
    The office of a Director shall be vacated ipso facto if the Director: 
              (a) 
    is restricted or disqualified to act as a Director under the provisions of the   Acts  ; or 

21

              93. 
    The Company may from time to time by Variation Resolution increase or reduce the minimum or maximum number of Directors as set out in article 71, provided however that if a majority of the Board makes a recommendation to the members to change the minimum or maximum number of Directors, then an Ordinary Resolution to increase or reduce such minimum or maximum number shall be required. 
              94. 
    The Company may, by Ordinary Resolution, in accordance with the   Acts  , remove any Director before the expiration of his period of office notwithstanding anything in these articles or in any agreement between the Company and such Director. Such removal shall be without prejudice to any claim such Director may have for damages for breach of any contract of service between him and the Company. 
              95. 
    The Company may, by Ordinary Resolution, appoint another person in place of a Director removed from office under article   94   and without prejudice to the powers of the Directors under article 71 the Company in general meeting by Ordinary Resolution may appoint any person to be a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director, subject to the maximum number of Directors set out in article 71. 
              96. 
    The Directors may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director, provided that the appointment does not cause the number of Directors to exceed any number fixed by or in accordance with these articles as the maximum number of Directors. 
              97. 
    The Directors may appoint any person to fill the following positions: 
              (a)

    Secretary: 
     It shall be the duty of the Secretary to make and keep records of the votes, doings and proceedings of all meetings of the members and Board of the Company, and of its Committees, and to authenticate records of the Company. The Secretary shall be appointed by the Directors for such term, at such remuneration and upon such conditions as they may think fit; and any Secretary so appointed may be removed by them. 
  A provision of the Acts or these articles requiring or authorising a thing to be done by or to a Director and the Secretary shall not be satisfied by its being done by or to the same person acting both as Director and as, or in place of, the Secretary. 

22 

(c) 
    Assistant Secretary: 
     The Assistant Secretary shall have such duties as the Secretary shall determine.

     The powers and duties of all other officers are at all times subject to the control of the Directors, and any other officer may be removed at any time at the pleasure of the Board. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected or appointed or until his or her prior death, resignation or removal. 
  In addition to the Board s power to delegate to committees pursuant to article   103,   the Board may delegate any of its powers to any individual Director or member of the management of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as it sees fit; any such individual shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on them by the Board. 
  PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS 
           98. 
    (a)    The Directors may meet together for the dispatch of business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings as they may think fit. The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the Directors shall be a majority of the Directors in office at the time when the meeting is convened. Questions arising at any meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. Each director present and voting shall have one vote. 
              (b) 
    Any Director may participate in a meeting of the Directors by means of telephonic or other such communication whereby all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other speak, and participation in a meeting in this manner shall be deemed to constitute presence in person at such meeting and any Director may be situated in any part of the world for any such meeting. 
              99. 
    The Chairman or a majority of the Directors may, and the Secretary on the requisition of the Chairman or a majority of the Directors shall, at any time summon a meeting of the Directors. 
              100. 
    The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their number but, if and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors or Director may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number or of summoning a general meeting of the Company but for no other purpose. 
              101. 
    The Directors may elect a Chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office. The Chairman does not need to be a member of the Board but if no such Chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the Chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be Chairman of the meeting. 
              102. 
    In the event of tie vote with respect to any resolution of the Board, the Chairman shall not have a casting or deciding vote. 
              103. 
    The Board may from time to time designate committees of the Board and may delegate any of its powers (with power to sub-delegate) to such committees, with such powers and duties as the Board may decide to confer on such committees, and shall, for those committees and any others provided for herein, elect a director or directors to serve as the member or members, designating, if it desires, other directors as alternate members who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Any such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the Board may impose, and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of its own powers and may be revoked or altered. Adequate provision shall be made for notice to members of all meetings; a majority of the members shall constitute a quorum unless  

23 

the committee shall consist of one or two members, in which event one member shall constitute a quorum; and all matters shall be determined by a majority vote of the members present. Action may be taken by any committee without a meeting if all members thereof consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of such committees. 
           104. 
    A committee may elect a chairman of its meeting. If no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 
              105. 
    All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. 
              106. 
    Notwithstanding anything in these articles or in the Acts which might be construed as providing to the contrary, notice of every meeting of the Directors shall be given to all Directors either by mail not less than 48 hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone, email, or any other electronic means on not less than 24 hours  notice, or on such shorter notice as person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate and which is reasonable in the circumstances. Any director may waive any notice required to be given under these articles, and the attendance of a director at a meeting shall be deemed to be a waiver by such Director. 
              107. 
    A resolution or other document in writing (in electronic form or otherwise) signed (whether by electronic signature, advanced electronic signature or otherwise as approved by the Directors) by all the Directors entitled to receive notice of a meeting of Directors or of a committee of Directors shall be as valid as if it had been passed at a meeting of Directors or (as the case may be) a committee of Directors duly convened and held and may consist of several documents in the like form each signed by one or more Directors, and such resolution or other document or documents when duly signed may be delivered or transmitted (unless the Directors shall otherwise determine either generally or in any specific case) by facsimile transmission, electronic mail or some other similar means of transmitting the contents of documents. 
     THE SEAL 
           108. 
    (a)    The Directors shall ensure that the Seal (including any official securities seal kept pursuant to the Acts) shall be used only by the authority of the Directors or of a committee authorised by the Directors and that every instrument to which the seal shall be affixed shall be signed by a Director or some other person appointed by the Directors for that purpose. 
              (b) 
    The Company may exercise the powers conferred by the Acts with regard to having an official seal for use abroad and such powers shall be vested in the Directors. 
     DIVIDENDS AND RESERVES 
           109. 
    The Company in general meeting may declare dividends, but no dividends shall exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. 
              110. 
    The Directors may from time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear to the Directors to be justified by the profits of the Company. 
              111. 
    No dividend or interim dividend shall be paid otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the   Acts  . 
              112. 
    The Directors may, before recommending any dividend, set aside out of the profits of the Company such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for any purpose to which  

24 

the profits of the Company may be properly applied and pending such application may at the like discretion either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as the Directors may lawfully determine. The Directors may also, without placing the same to reserve, carry forward any profits which they may think it prudent not to divide. 
           113. 
    Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to shares with special rights as to dividend, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; but if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, such share shall rank for dividend accordingly. 
              114. 
    The Directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money (if any) immediately payable by him to the Company in relation to the shares of the Company. 
              115. 
    Any general meeting declaring a dividend or bonus and any resolution of the Directors declaring an interim dividend may direct payment of such dividend or bonus or interim dividend wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stocks of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and the Directors shall give effect to such resolution, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any members upon the footing of the value so fixed, in order to adjust the rights of all the parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 
              116. 
    Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of any share may be paid by cheque or warrant sent by post, at the risk of the person or persons entitled thereto, to the registered address of the Holder or, where there are joint Holders, to the registered address of that one of the joint Holders who is first named on the members Register or to such person and to such address as the Holder or joint Holders may in writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a good discharge to the Company. Any joint Holder or other person jointly entitled to a share as aforesaid may give receipts for any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share. Any such dividend or other distribution may also be paid by any other method (including payment in a currency other than US$, electronic funds transfer, direct debit, bank transfer or by means of a relevant system) which the Directors consider appropriate and any member who elects for such method of payment shall be deemed to have accepted all of the risks inherent therein. The debiting of the Company s account in respect of the relevant amount shall be evidence of good discharge of the Company s obligations in respect of any payment made by any such methods. In respect of shares in uncertificated form, where the Company is authorised to do so by or on behalf of the Holder or joint Holders in such manner as the Company shall from time to time consider sufficient, the Company may also pay any such dividend, interest or other moneys by means of the relevant system concerned (subject always to the facilities and requirements of that relevant system).  Every such payment made by means of the relevant system shall be made in such manner as may be consistent with the facilities and requirements of the relevant system concerned. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, in respect of shares in uncertificated form, such payment may include the sending by the Company or by any person on its behalf of an instruction to the operator of the relevant system to credit the cash memorandum account of the Holder or joint Holders. 
              117. 
    No dividend shall bear interest against the Company. 
              118. 
    If the Directors so resolve, any dividend which has remained unclaimed for twelve years from the date of its declaration shall be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment by the Directors of any unclaimed dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect thereof. 

25 

ACCOUNTS 
           119. 
    (a)    The Directors shall cause   the Company to keep adequate accounting records, which are sufficient to - 
              (b) 
    correctly record and explain the transactions of the Company; 
              (c) 
    enable,   at any time  ,   the   assets, liabilities,   financial position   and profit or loss   of the Company to be determined with reasonable accuracy; 
              (d) 
    enable the Directors to ensure that any   financial statements of the Company and any directors  report, required to be prepared under the Acts, comply   with the requirements of the Acts   and, where applicable, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and 
              (e) 
    enable   those financial statements   of the Company to be audited. 
     Accounting records   shall be kept on a continuous and consistent basis and entries therein shall be made in a timely manner and be consistent from year to year   in accordance with the Acts  . 
  The Company may send a summary financial statement to its   Members   or persons nominated by any   Member and the   Company may meet, but shall be under no obligation to meet, any request from any of its   Members   to be sent additional copies of   the documents required to be sent to Members by the Acts or any   summary financial statement or other communications with its   Members  . 
  CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS 
           120. 
    Without prejudice to any powers conferred on the Directors as aforesaid and subject to the Directors  authority to issue and allot shares under articles 6(c) and 6(d), the Directors may resolve to capitalise any part of the amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the Company s reserve accounts  (including any capital redemption reserve fund, share premium account or other reserve account not available for distribution) or to the credit of the profit and loss account which is not available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up in full unissued shares to be allotted as fully paid bonus shares to those members of the Company who would have been entitled to that sum if it were distributable and had been distributed by way of dividend (and in the same proportions). Whenever such a resolution is passed in pursuance of this article, the Directors shall make all appropriations and applications of the amounts resolved to be capitalised thereby and all allotments and issues of fully paid shares or debentures, if any. 
              121. 
    Without prejudice to any powers conferred on the Directors by these articles, and subject to the Directors  authority to issue and allot shares under articles 6(c) and 6(d), the Directors may resolve that any sum for the time being standing to the credit of any of the Company s reserve accounts (including any reserve account available for distribution) or to the credit of the profit and loss account be capitalised and applied on behalf of the members who would have been entitled to receive that sum if it had been distributed by way of dividend (and in the same proportions) either in or towards paying up amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or in paying up in full unissued shares or debentures of the Company of a nominal amount equal to the sum capitalised (such shares or debentures to be allotted and distributed and credited as fully paid up to and amongst such Holders in the proportions aforesaid) or partly in one way and partly in another, so, however, that the only purposes for which sums standing to the credit of the capital redemption reserve fund or the share premium account shall be applied shall be those permitted by the Acts. 
              122. 
    The Directors may from time to time at their discretion, subject to the provisions of the Acts and, in particular, to their being duly authorised pursuant to the   Acts  , to allot the relevant shares, offer to the Holders of Ordinary Shares the right to elect to receive in lieu of any dividend or proposed dividend or part thereof an allotment of additional Ordinary Shares credited as fully paid. In any such case the following provisions shall apply. 

26 

(a) 
    The basis of allotment of the further shares shall be decided by the Board so that, as nearly as may can be considered convenient, the value of the further, including any fractional entitlement, is equal to the amount of the cash dividend which would otherwise have been paid. For these purposes the value of the further shares shall be calculated in such manner as may be determined by the Board, but the value shall not in any event be less than the nominal value of a share.  
              (b) 
    The Board shall give notice to the Holders of their rights of election in respect of the scrip dividend and shall specify the procedure to be followed in order to make an election.  
              (c) 
    The dividend or that part of it in respect of which an election for the scrip dividend is made shall not be paid and instead further shares shall be allotted in accordance with election duly made and the Board shall capitalise a sum equal to not less than the aggregate nominal value of, nor more than the aggregate  value  (as determined under article 1  22  (b)) of, the shares to be allotted, as the Board may determine out of such sums available for the purpose as the Board may consider appropriate. 
              (d) 
    The Board may decide that the right to elect for any scrip dividend shall not be made available to Holders resident in any territory where, in the opinion of the Board, compliance by the Company with local laws or regulations would be unduly onerous.  
              (e) 
    The Board may do all acts and things considered necessary or expedient to give effect to the provisions of a scrip dividend election and the issue of any share in accordance with the provisions of this article   122,   and may make such provisions as it thinks fit for the case of shares becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions under which, in whole or in part, the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to the Company rather than to the Holders concerned). 
              (f) 
    The Board may from time to time establish or vary a procedure for election mandates, under which a holder of shares may, in respect of any future dividends for which a right of election pursuant to this article   122   is offered, elect to receive further shares in lieu of such dividend on the terms of such mandate. 
              123. 
    (a)    The additional Ordinary Shares allotted pursuant to articles   120, 121   or 1  22   shall rank pari passu in all respects with the fully paid Ordinary Shares then in issue save only as regards participation in the relevant dividend or share election in lieu. 
              (b) 
    The Directors may do all acts and things considered necessary or expedient to give effect to any capitalisation pursuant to articles   120, 121   or   122   with full power to the Directors to make such provisions as they think fit where shares would otherwise have been distributable in fractions (including provisions whereby, in whole or in part, fractional entitlements are disregarded and the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to the Company rather than to the holders concerned).  The Directors may authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the Holders interested into an agreement with the Company providing for such capitalisation and matters incidental thereto and any agreement made under such authority shall be effective and binding on all concerned. 
              (c) 
    The Directors may on any occasion determine that rights of election shall not be offered to any Holders of Ordinary Shares who are citizens or residents of any territory where the making or publication of an offer of rights of election or any exercise of rights of election or any purported acceptance of the same would or might be unlawful, and in such event the provisions aforesaid shall be read and construed subject to such determination. 
     AUDIT 
           124. 
    Statutory auditors   shall be appointed and their duties regulated in accordance with the   Acts   or any statutory amendment thereof. 

27 

NOTICES 
           125. 
    Any notice to be given, served, sent or delivered pursuant to these articles shall be in writing (whether in electronic form or otherwise). 
              126. 
    (a)    A notice or document to be given, served, sent or delivered in pursuance of these articles may be given to, served on or delivered to any member by the Company; 
              (i)

    by sending the same by the post in a pre-paid cover addressed to him at his registered address; or 
              (iv) 
    by sending the notice or document by means of electronic mail or making it available by other means of electronic communication approved by the Directors (including placing a copy of the notice or document on the website of the Company) PROVIDED THAT any Holder may require the Company to send him a physical copy of the notice or document by requesting the Company to do so PROVIDED FURTHER HOWEVER that such request is made after the date of adoption of this article and it may not take effect until 5 days after written notice of the request is received by the Company. 
              (b) 
    For the purposes of these articles and the Act, a document shall be deemed to have been sent to a member if a notice is given, served, sent or delivered to the member and the notice specifies the website or hotlink or other electronic link at or through which the member may obtain a copy of the relevant document. 
              (c) 
    Where a notice or document is given, served or delivered pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) of this article, the giving, service or delivery thereof shall be deemed to have been effected at the time the same was handed to the member or his authorised agent, or left at his registered address (as the case may be). 
              (d) 
    Where a notice or document is given, served or delivered pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(iii) of this article, the giving, service or delivery thereof shall be deemed to have been effected at the expiration of twenty-four hours after the cover containing it was posted. In proving service or delivery it shall be sufficient to prove that such cover was properly addressed, stamped and posted. 
              (e) 
    Where a notice or document is given, served or delivered pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(iv) of this article, the giving, service or delivery thereof shall be deemed to have been effected at the expiration of 48 hours after despatch. 
              (f) 
    Every legal personal representative, committee, receiver, curator bonis or other legal curator, assignee in bankruptcy, examiner or liquidator of a member shall be bound by a notice given as aforesaid if sent to the last registered address of such member, or, in the event of notice given or delivered pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(iv), if sent to the address notified by the Company by the member for such purpose notwithstanding that the Company may have notice of the death, lunacy, bankruptcy, liquidation or disability of such member. 
              (g) 
    Notwithstanding anything contained in this article the Company shall not be obliged to take account of or make any investigations as to the existence of any suspension or curtailment of postal services within or in relation to all or any part of any jurisdiction or other area other than Ireland. 
              (h) 
    Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii) of this article, if at any time by reason of the suspension or curtailment of postal services in any territory, the Company is unable effectively to convene a general meeting by notices sent through the post, a general meeting may be convened by a public announcement  

28 

and such notice shall be deemed to have been duly served on all members entitled thereto at noon on the day on which the said public announcement is made. In any such case the Company shall put a full copy of the notice of the general meeting on its website. 
           127. 
    A notice may be given by the Company to the joint Holders of a share by giving the notice to the joint Holder whose name stands first in the Register in respect of the share and notice so given shall be sufficient notice to all the joint Holders. 
              128. 
    (a)    Every person who becomes entitled to a share shall before his name is entered in the Register in respect of the share, be bound by any notice in respect of that share which has been duly given to a person from whom he derives his title. 
              (b) 
    A notice may be given by the Company to the persons entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member by sending or delivering it, in any manner authorised by these articles for the giving of notice to a member, addressed to them at the address, if any, supplied by them for that purpose. Until such an address has been supplied, a notice may be given in any manner in which it might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 
              129. 
    A member present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the Company or the Holders of any class of shares in the Company shall be deemed to have received notice of the meeting and, where requisite, of the purposes for which it was called. 
     WINDING UP 
           130. 
    If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution among the members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up or credited as paid up share capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the members in proportion to the capital paid up or credited as paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution among the members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital paid up or credited as paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed among the members in proportion to the capital at the commencement of the winding up paid up or credited as paid up on the said shares held by them respectively. Provided that this article shall not affect the rights of the Holders of shares issued upon special terms and conditions. 
              131. 
    (a)    In case of a sale by the liquidator under section   601   of the   Companies   Act, the liquidator may by the contract of sale agree so as to bind all the members for the allotment to the members directly of the proceeds of sale in proportion to their respective interests in the Company and may further by the contract limit a time at the expiration of which obligations or shares not accepted or required to be sold shall be deemed to have been irrevocably refused and be at the disposal of the Company, but so that nothing herein contained shall be taken to diminish, prejudice or affect the rights of dissenting members conferred by the said section. 
              (b) 
    The power of sale of the liquidator shall include a power to sell wholly or partially for debentures, debenture stock, or other obligations of another company, either then already constituted or about to be constituted for the purpose of carrying out the sale. 
              132. 
    If the Company is wound up, the liquidator, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Acts, may divide among the members in specie or kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not), and, for such purpose, may value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of members. The liquidator, with the like sanction, may vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories  

29 

as, with the like sanction, he determines, but so that no member shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability. 
  INDEMNITY 
           133. 
    (a)    Subject to the provisions of and so far as may be admitted by the Acts, every Director and the Secretary of the Company shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company against all costs, charges, losses, expenses and liabilities incurred by him in the execution and discharge of his duties or in relation thereto including any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, civil or criminal, which relate to anything done or omitted or alleged to have been done or omitted by him as an officer or employee of the Company and in which judgement is given in his favour (or the proceedings are otherwise disposed of without any finding or admission of any material breach of duty on his part) or in which he is acquitted or in connection with any application under any statute for relief from liability in respect of any such act or omission in which relief is granted to him by the Court. 
              (b) 
    The Directors shall have power to purchase and maintain for any Director, the Secretary or any employees of the Company or its subsidiaries insurance against any such liability as referred to in section   235   of the   Companies   Act. 
              (c) 
    As far as is permissible under the Acts, the Company shall indemnify any current or former executive officer of the Company (excluding any present or former Directors of the Company or Secretary of the Company), or any person who is serving or has served at the request of the Company as a director or executive officer of another company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including any Company subsidiary (each individually, a  Covered Person ), against any expenses, including attorney s fees, judgements, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to which he or she was or is threatened to be made a party, or is otherwise involved (a  proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Covered Person; provided, however, that this provision shall not indemnify any Covered Person against any liability arising out of (a) any fraud or dishonesty in the performance of such Covered Person s duty to the Company, or (b) such Covered Party s conscious, intentional or wilful breach of the obligation to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this section shall not extend to any matter which would render it void pursuant to the Acts or to any person holding the office of   statutory   auditor in relation to the Company. 
              (d) 
    In the case of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the name of the Company, the Company shall indemnify each Covered Person against expenses, including attorneys  fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defence or the settlement thereof, except no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for fraud or dishonesty in the performance of his or her duty to the Company, or for conscious, intentional or wilful breach of his or her obligation to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company, unless and only to the extent that the High Court of Ireland or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such Covered Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this section shall not extend to any matter which would render it void pursuant to the Acts or to any person holding the office of   statutory   auditor in relation to the Company. 
              (e) 
    Any indemnification under this article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorised in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this article. Such  

30 

determination shall be made by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Company. To the extent, however, that any Covered Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defence of any proceeding, or in defence of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Covered Person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys  fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without necessity of authorisation in the specific case. 
           (f) 
    As far as permissible under the Acts, expenses, including attorneys  fees, incurred in defending any proceeding for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to this article shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt by the Board of an undertaking by the particular indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company pursuant to these articles. 
              (g) 
    It being the policy of the Company that indemnification of the persons specified in this article shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law, the indemnification provided by this article shall not be deemed exclusive (a) of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under these articles, any agreement, any insurance purchased by the Company, vote of members or disinterested directors, or pursuant to the direction (however embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, or (b) of the power of the Company to indemnify any person who is or was an employee or agent of the Company or of another company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise which he or she is serving or has served at the request of the Company, to the same extent and in the same situations and subject to the same determinations as are hereinabove set forth. As used in this article, references to the  Company  include all constituent companies in a scheme of arrangement, consolidation or merger in which the Company or a predecessor to the Company by scheme of arrangement, consolidation or merger was involved. The indemnification provided by this article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Covered Person and shall inure to the benefit of their heirs, executors, and administrators. 
     UNTRACED HOLDERS 
           134. 
    (a)    The Company shall be entitled to sell at the best price reasonably obtainable any share or stock of a member or any share or stock to which a person is entitled by transmission if and provided that: 
              (i) 
    for a period of twelve years (not less than three dividends having been declared and paid) no cheque or warrant sent by the Company through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to the member or to the person entitled by transmission to the share or stock at his address on the Register or other last known address given by the member or the person entitled by transmission to which cheques and warrants are to be sent has been cashed and no communication has been received by the Company from the member or the person entitled by transmission; and 
              (ii) 
    at the expiration of the said period of twelve years the Company has given notice by advertisement in a leading Dublin newspaper and a newspaper circulating in the area in which the address referred to in paragraph (a) of this article is located of its intention to sell such share or stock; and 
              (iii) 
    the Company has not during the further period of three months after the date of the advertisement and prior to the exercise of the power of sale received any communication from the member or person entitled by transmission. 
              (b) 
    To give effect to any such sale the Company may appoint any person to execute as transferor an instrument of transfer of such share or stock and such instrument of transfer shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the registered Holder of or person entitled by transmission to such share or stock. The Company shall account  

31 

to the member or other person entitled to such share or stock for the net proceeds of such sale by carrying all monies in respect thereof to a separate account which shall be a permanent debt of the Company and the Company shall be deemed to be a debtor and not a trustee in respect thereof for such member or other person. Monies carried to such separate account may either be employed in the business of the Company or invested in such investments (other than shares of the Company or its holding company if any) as the Directors may from time to time think fit. 
           (c) 
    To the extent necessary in order to comply with any laws or regulations to which the Company is subject in relation to escheatment, abandonment of property or other similar or analogous laws or regulations ( Applicable Escheatment Laws ), the Company may deal with any share of any member and any unclaimed cash payments relating to such share in any manner which it sees fit, including (but not limited to) transferring or selling such share and transferring to third parties any unclaimed cash payments relating to such share. 
              (d) 
    The Company may only exercise the powers granted to it in sub-paragraph (a) above in circumstances where it has complied with, or procured compliance with, the required procedures (as set out in the Applicable Escheatment Laws) with respect to attempting to identify and locate the relevant member of the Company. 
              (e) 
    Any stock transfer form to be executed by the Company in order to sell or transfer a share pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) may be executed in accordance with article 13(a). 
     DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 
           135. 
    The Company may implement such document destruction policies as it so chooses in relation to any type of documents (whether in paper, electronic or other formats), and in particular (without limitation to the foregoing) may destroy: 
              (a) 
    any dividend mandate or any variation or cancellation thereof or any notification of change of name or address, at any time after the expiry of two years from the date such mandate variation, cancellation or notification was recorded by the Company; 
              (b) 
    any instrument of transfer of shares which has been registered, at any time after the expiry of six years from the date of registration; and 
              (c) 
    any other document on the basis of which any entry in the Register was made, at any time after the expiry of six years from the date an entry in the Register was first made in respect of it, 
     and it shall be presumed conclusively in favour of the Company that every share certificate (if any) so destroyed was a valid certificate duly and properly sealed and that every instrument of transfer so destroyed was a valid and effective instrument duly and properly registered and that every other document destroyed hereunder was a valid and effective document in accordance with the recorded particulars thereof in the books or records of the Company provided always that: 
           (i) 
    the foregoing provisions of this article shall apply only to the destruction of a document in good faith and without express notice to the Company that the preservation of such document was relevant to a claim; 
              (ii) 
    nothing contained in this article shall be construed as imposing upon the Company any liability in respect of the destruction of any such document earlier than as aforesaid or in any case where the conditions of proviso (a) above are not fulfilled; and 
              (iii) 
    references in this article to the destruction of any document include references to its disposal in any manner.

    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

  Certification of CEO Pursuant To 
  18 U.S.C. Section 1350, 
  As Adopted Pursuant To 
  Section 906 Of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act Of 2002 
    
  In connection with the Quarterly Report of Pentair plc (the  Company ) on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the  Report ), I, Randall J.
