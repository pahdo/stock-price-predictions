1.      BASIS
                                         OF PRESENTATION     

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation
S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes
that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  

In
the opinion of management, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 which has been derived from audited financial
statements and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered
necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period.  

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management s
Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Amendment No. 4 to Form S-1 for the period from
June 23, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2015.  

2.      DESCRIPTION
                                         OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION     

Bosy
Holdings Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2015. The Company is a development
stage company that intends to provide agarwood inoculation services and plantation management projects.  

3.      GOING
                                         CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES     

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business
for the foreseeable future.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $18,920 and incurred a net operating loss of $10,024 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had generated no revenue or committed sources of capital or financing for the
reporting period. While the Company has not generated revenues from its services, the Company s cash position may not be
enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further
implement its business plan and generate additional services and revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue
as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to realize revenues and in its ability to raise
additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to achieve profitable operations or obtain adequate financing.  

These
and other factors raise significant doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going
concern.  

4.   
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis
of presentation  

The
accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America ( US GAAP ).  

Use
of estimates  

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheet,
and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Cash
and cash equivalents  

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.

Income
taxes  

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.  

Fair
value of financial instruments  

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepayments and other
receivables, amount due to a director, and other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of
the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  

The
Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level 1 : Observable
inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;   

Level 2 : Inputs, other
than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and   

Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
    own assumptions    

Recent
accounting pronouncements  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) , and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for
those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards
Update to defer by one year the effective dates of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning
after January December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year public entities) and interim periods therein. Management is currently
assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic
915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in
Topic 810, Consolidation,  ( ASU 2014-10"). ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from
the ASC, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities
from GAAP. In addition, ASU 2014-10 eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information in the statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged,
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
in the development stage. ASU 2014-10 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim
periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt ASU 2014-10 effective with this registration statement
on Form S-1 and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage disclosures.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718).   The pronouncement
was issued to clarify the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could
be achieved after the requisite service period.  The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15"), which establishes management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and,
if so, to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term  substantial doubt  and
requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued.
Management will also be required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The guidance is effective for
the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial statement presentation and disclosures.  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items.  ASU
2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP.  As a result, an entity will no longer be required
to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present an extraordinary item on its income
statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable
to an extraordinary item.  However, ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items
that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently.  ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15,
2015.  The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  Early adoption is permitted.    

FASB
issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. 
On June 10, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10, Development Stage
Entities (Topic 915) - Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities
Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting
guidance.  The Company has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement
to disclose results of operations and cash flows since inception.  

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

a broad range of income tax rates. The Company and its subsidiary that operate in various countries: United States and Seychelles

2016, there is no operations in the United States of America. The net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2035, if
unutilized. The Company has provided for a full valuation allowance of $6,539 against the deferred tax assets on the expected
future tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards as the management believes it is more likely than not that these
assets will not be realized in the future.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the cash flows used in operating activities was $7,854 and $595 respectively.
Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the reason for our negative operating cash flow.

Going
Concern  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $18,920 and incurred a net operating loss of $10,024 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had no revenue or committed sources of capital or financing for the reporting
period. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated
financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements  

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to our stockholders as of September 30, 2016.

a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:     

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operations Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Operations Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.   

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude
that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties
and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with
respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:     

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending September 30, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
