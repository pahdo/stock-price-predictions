Organization and Basis of Presentation   

PositiveID
Corporation, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries PositiveID Diagnostics Inc. ( PDI ), and E-N-G Mobile Systems,
Inc. ( ENG ), and Thermomedics, Inc. ( Thermomedics ), (collectively, the  Company  or  PositiveID ),
develops molecular diagnostic systems for bio-threat detection and rapid medical testing; markets the Caregiver  non-contact
clinical thermometer; and manufactures specialty technology vehicles. The Company s fully automated pathogen detection systems
and assays are designed to detect a range of biological threats. The Company s M-BAND (Microfluidic Bio-agent Autonomous
Networked Detector) system is an airborne bio-threat detection system developed for the homeland defense industry to detect biological
weapons of mass destruction. The Company is developing Firefly Dx, an automated pathogen detection system for rapid diagnostics,
both for clinical and point-of-need applications. The Company s Caregiver  thermometer is an FDA-cleared infrared thermometer
for the professional healthcare market. The Company also manufactures specialty technology vehicles focused primarily on mobile
laboratory and communications applications.  

Authorized
Common Stock   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company was authorized to issue 3.895 billion shares of common stock. On February 25, 2016, the Company
filed the Seventh Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the State of Delaware
to increase the number of authorized common shares to 3.895 billion shares, from 1.97 billion shares. On June 27, 2016, the Company s
Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split in the ratio of 1-for-50 and the Company filed the Eighth Certificate of Amendment
to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
to affect the reverse stock split. The reverse split only affected outstanding common stock and the number of authorized shares
was not adjusted. On July 5, 2016, the reverse stock split became effective. All share amounts in our historical financial statements
have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-50 reverse stock split.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $12 million and a stockholders  deficit of approximately
$10.3 million, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $10.7 million and a stockholders  deficit of approximately
$11.8 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase in the working capital deficit was primarily due to operating losses for the
period and capital raised through convertible debt financings that was spent on operations.  

We
have incurred operating losses and net cash used in operating activities prior to and since the merger that created PositiveID.
The operating losses during 2015 and for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 are the result of research and development
expenditures, selling, general and administrative expenses related to our molecular diagnostics and Caregiver  products. We
expect our operating losses to continue through 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern.  

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing to fund the continued development of
our products and to support working capital requirements. Until we are able to achieve operating profits, we will continue to
seek to access the capital markets. In 2015 and for the first nine months of 2016, we raised approximately $5.9 and $3.1 million,
respectively from the issuance of convertible debt.  

The
Company intends to continue to access capital to provide funds to meet its working capital requirements for the near-term future.
In addition, and if necessary, the Company could reduce and/or delay certain discretionary research, development and related activities
and costs. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to negotiate additional sources of equity or credit
for its long-term capital needs. The Company s inability to have continuous access to such financing at reasonable costs
could materially and adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and result in significant
dilution to the Company s existing stockholders. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to recoverability of assets and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited financial
statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and note disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules
and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.
In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair
presentation for the periods presented have been reflected as required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01.  

The
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

There
are no new accounting pronouncements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that affect the consolidated financial position
of the Company or the results of its operations. Accounting Standard Updates which are not effective until after September 30,
2016, including the pronouncements discussed below, are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated
financial position or results of its  operations.  

ASU
2016-15:  

In
August 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ), 2016-15    Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. Effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an
interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. This updated guidance is not expected
to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

ASU
2016-12:  

In
May 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ), 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards
Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606 ) , which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition
requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (and
any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. This updated guidance is not expected
to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

ASU
2016-10:  

In
April 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ), 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards
Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition
requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and
any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition.  

ASU
2016-09:  

In
March 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ), 2016-09   Compensation Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . For public business entities, the amendments are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other
entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity
early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that
includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. This updated
guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for any of
the following:  

1.  
      A
    public business entity   

2.  
      A
    not-for-profit entity that has issued, or is a conduit bond obligor for, securities that are traded, listed, or quoted on

3.  
      An
    employee benefit plan that files financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   

For
all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application of the amendments in this Update is permitted
for all entities. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition.  

AUS
2015-11:  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires an entity to measure most
inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure
inventory at the lower of cost or market. The accounting standard is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.  

ASU
2014-15:  

In
August 2014, the FASB  issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40); Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . This update
requires management of the Company to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. This update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim
periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have an impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  

ASU
2014-09:  

In
June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The update gives entities a single comprehensive model to use in reporting information about the amount and timing of revenue
resulting from contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The proposed ASU, which would apply to any entity that enters
into contracts to provide goods or services, would supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,
and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, the update would supersede
some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition   Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The
update removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue
issues and more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. In addition, the
update improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets
and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. The
update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting
period. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries of which all
are inactive except for PDI, ENG and Thermomedics. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Significant estimates during the reported periods include valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventories valuation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets,
valuation of loss and other contingencies, product warranty liabilities, valuation of derivatives, valuation of beneficial conversion
features, estimate of contingent earn-out liabilities, valuation of stock-based compensation and an estimate of the deferred tax
asset valuation allowance.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
the purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company maintained its cash in various financial institutions during the year ended December
31, 2015 and as of September 30, 2016. Balances were insured up to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )
limits. At times, cash deposits exceeded the federally insured limits however, the Company has not incurred any losses to date.
There were no cash deposits that exceeded the federally insured limits as of September 30, 2016.  

Accounts
receivable   

Accounts
receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The Company reviews its accounts to estimate losses resulting from
the inability of its customers to make required payments. Any required allowance is based on specific analysis of past due accounts
and also considers historical trends of write-offs. Past due status is based on how recently payments have been received from
customers. The Company s collection experience has been favorable reflecting a limited number of customers. No allowance
was deemed necessary at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Inventories   

Inventory
consists of finished goods of our Caregiver  non-contact thermometers, and in our Mobile Lab Segment consists of standard
and manufactured frames and bodies of vehicles, components of mobile units and other materials and is stated at lower of cost
or market and net realizable value on average basis. Reserves, if necessary, are recorded to reduce inventory to market value
based on assumptions about consumer demand, current inventory levels and product life cycles for the various inventory items.
These assumptions are evaluated periodically and are based on the Company s business plan and from feedback from customers
and the product development team; however, estimates can vary significantly. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015,
inventory reserves were not material.  

Inventories
consisted of the following (in thousands):

Reserves
for Warranty   

The
Company records a reserve at the time product revenue is recorded based on historical rates. The reserve is reviewed during the
year and is adjusted, if appropriate, to reflect new product offerings or changes in experience. Actual warranty claims are tracked
by product line. The warranty reserve was not material.  

Equipment   

Equipment
is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life, software is depreciated over 5 years, and equipment
is depreciated over periods ranging from 1 to 8 years. Repairs and maintenance which do not extend the useful life of the asset
are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on sales and retirements are reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations.  

Depreciation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $11,000 and $400, respectively, and $33,000 and
$2,000 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Intangible
Assets and Goodwill   

Intangible
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
Customer contracts and relationships are being amortized over a period of 3 years, patents and other intellectual property are
being amortized over a period of 5 years, and non-compete agreements are being amortized over 2 years.  

The
Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives
of its definite-lived intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.
The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows attributable to such asset over the remaining life of the
asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.  

The
Company records goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in business
combinations. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units as of the acquisition date for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing.
The Company s reporting units are those businesses for which discrete financial information is prepared. Goodwill of a reporting
unit is tested for impairment at year-end, or between testing dates if an impairment condition or event is determined to have
occurred.  

In
assessing potential impairment of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the PDI, ENG and Thermomedics acquisitions,
as of September 30, 2016, we considered the likelihood of future cash flows attributable to such assets. Based on our analysis,
we have concluded based on information currently available, that no impairment of the intangible assets exists as of September
30, 2016. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of December 31, 2015. As a result of this annual test,
using the market capitalization method of valuation, it was determined that the goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015 was not
impaired.  

Amortization
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $39,000 and $31,000, respectively and $218,000 and $91,000
for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectability of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured,
the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and upon completion and delivery in accordance with the customer contract or purchase
order.  

If
at the outset of an arrangement, the Company determines that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until
the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customer s
acceptance of the Company s deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance
or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, the Company determines that the arrangement fee is
not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition
criteria have been met.  

To
date, the Company has generated revenue from three sources: (1) professional services (consulting   advisory), (2) technology
licensing, and (3) product sales.

   (Unaudited)   

Specific
revenue recognition criteria for each source of revenue is as follows:  

(1)  
      Revenues
    for professional services, which are of short term duration, are recognized when services are provided,   

(2)  
      Technology
    license revenue is recognized upon the completion of all terms of that license. Payments received in advance of completion
    of the license terms are recorded as deferred revenue.   

(3)  
      Revenue
    from sales of the Company s products is recorded when risk of loss has passed to the buyer and criteria for revenue
    recognition discussed above is met. Payments received in advance of delivery and revenue recognition are recorded as deferred
    revenue.    

If
these criteria are not met, the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized
ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered
element is delivered. If these criteria are met for each element and there is a relative selling price for all units of accounting
in an arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative
selling price.  

Concentrations   

Concentration
of Deferred Revenue   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had deferred revenue of approximately $0.1 million of which 58% and 33% were from the Company s
two largest customers. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred revenue of approximately $1.8 million of which 21%, 22%
and 38% were from the Company s three largest customers.  

Concentration
of Revenues   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had revenue of approximately $1.1 million of which 34%, 17% and 12% were
from the Company s three largest customers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had revenue of
approximately $4.6 million of which 33% and 17% were from the Company s two largest customers. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company had revenue of $2.5 million of which 93% was from the Company s largest customer.  

Concentration
of Accounts Receivable

costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.  

Shipping
and Handling   

Costs
incurred by the Company for freight in are included in costs of revenue. Freight in costs incurred for the three and nine months

All
legal costs are charged to expense as incurred.  

Convertible
Notes With Variable Conversion Options   

The
Company has entered into convertible notes, some of which contain variable conversion options, whereby the outstanding principal
and accrued interest may be converted, by the holder, into common shares at a fixed discount to the price of the common stock
at the time of conversion. The Company measures the fair value of the notes at the time of issuance, which is the result of the
share price discount at the time of conversion, and records the premium as accretion to interest expense to the date of first
conversion.

The
Company accounts for debt issuance cost paid to lenders, or on behalf of lenders, in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. The costs
associated with the issuance of debt are recorded as debt discount and amortized over the life of the underlying debt instrument.  

Accounting
for Derivatives   

The
Company evaluates its convertible debt, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components
of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that under
certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.
In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations
as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a convertible note containing an embedded derivative instrument, the
instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity and the note is reclassified
to equity without gain or loss. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
under this accounting standard are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements   

The
Company measures its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as makes related disclosures, in accordance with
ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC Topic 820 ). For certain of our financial instruments,
including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due
to their short maturities. Amounts recorded for notes payable, net of discount, also approximate fair value because current interest
rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities are substantially the same.  

ASC
Topic 820 provides guidance with respect to valuation techniques to be utilized in the determination of fair value of assets and
liabilities. Approaches include, (i) the market approach (comparable market prices), (ii) the income approach (present value of
future income or cash flow), and (iii) the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
ASC Topic 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
    1:  
      Observable
    inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2:  
      Inputs
    other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets
    or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
    active.   

Level
    3:  
      Unobservable
    inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which
    reflect those that a market participant would use.   

Stock-Based
Compensation   

Stock-based
compensation expenses are reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of operations under selling, general and administrative
expenses and research and development expenses.  

Compensation
expense for all stock-based employee and director compensation awards granted is based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 ). The Company recognizes these
compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term.
Vesting terms vary based on the individual grant terms.

   (Unaudited)   

The
Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM )
option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are freely transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected stock price volatility. The BSM option pricing model considers, among other factors, the expected term of the award
and the expected volatility of the Company s stock price. Expected terms are calculated using the Simplified Method, volatility
is determined based on the Company s historical stock price trends and the discount rate is based upon treasury rates with
instruments of similar expected terms. Warrants granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with the measurement
and recognition criteria of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees.  

Loss
per Common Share   

The
Company presents basic income (loss) per common share and, if applicable, diluted income (loss) per share. Basic income (loss)
per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year and after preferred stock
dividend requirements. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per common share assumes that any dilutive convertible preferred
shares outstanding at the beginning of each year or the date issued were convertible at those dates, with preferred stock dividend
requirements and outstanding common shares adjusted accordingly. It also assumes that outstanding common shares were increased
by shares issuable upon exercise of those stock options and warrants for which the average period market price exceeds the exercise
price, less shares that could have been purchased by the Company with related proceeds. Additionally, shares issued upon conversion
of convertible debt are included.  

The
following potentially dilutive equity securities outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015 were not included
in the computation of dilutive loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):  

Segments   

The
Company follows the guidance of ASC 280-10 for  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. 
During 2015, the Company only operated in one segment   Diagnostics and Detection. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Company
operates in three business segments: Molecular Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Mobile Labs (see Note 9).  

Reclassifications   

The
Company reclassified $148,000 costs reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as Direct Labor into Cost of Revenues
to conform to the 2016 presentation.

Acquisitions/Dispositions   

ENG
Mobile Systems Acquisition   

On
December 24, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of E-N-G Mobile Systems, Inc. ( ENG )
from its sole shareholder (the  Seller ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, as consideration at the time of closing
of the Acquisition, PositiveID paid the Seller $750,000 in cash and issued a convertible secured promissory note to the Seller
in the amount of $150,000. The Company has also entered into a two-year consulting agreement with the Seller. The consulting agreement
was determined not to represent additional purchase price.  

Additional
earn-out payments may be earned by ENG. Each Earn-Out Payment, if any, will be calculated at 5% of the revenue actually recognized
and realized from each of the contracts and purchase orders identified, with an earn-out value indicated for each on the signed
backlog schedule (the  Signed Backlog Schedule ) subsequent to Closing. For purposes of determining whether any earn-out
payments will be made and the amount of such payment, the term Signed Backlog Schedule means those signed contracts and purchase
orders in effect as of the date of Closing but under which the product is yet to be delivered and all or a portion of the revenue
is yet to be recognized as of Closing. The earn-out payments are to be paid in cash within five business days following the date
the Company recognizes the revenue (including deposits held) and receives full payment from the applicable contract or purchase
order on the Signed Backlog Schedule. The Earn-Out Payments were subject to adjustment finalization of the purchase accounting.
The Company recorded a contingent earn-out liability of approximately $123,000, as a current liability, as reflected in the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and an offsetting recovery asset of approximately $111,000. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company and the seller of ENG agreed to the final measurement of the earn-out consideration taking into
account the finalization of the net asset balance, with total earnout payments of approximately $39,000 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. As a result, the Company recorded an additional expense of $27,300 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 which is included in change in acquisition obligation in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The contingent
earn-out liability related to ENG had no balance as of September 30, 2016.

The
estimated purchase price of the acquisition totaled $912,000, comprised of $750,000 in cash, a convertible seller note of $150,000
( ENG Note ), and the fair value of the contingent consideration estimated at approximately $123,000, less an estimated
recovery based on the closing net worth of ENG estimated at $111,000 at December 31, 2015. The fair value of the contingent consideration
was estimated based upon the present value of the expected future payouts of the contingent consideration and was subject to change
upon the finalization of the purchase accounting which occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company acquired ENG for a number of reasons including the experience of its workforce, the quality and long history of its product
offerings, its prospects for sales and profit growth, and the Company s ability to leverage its business relationships to
create new growth opportunities.  

In
connection with the issuance of the ENG Note, the Company computed a premium of $50,000 as the note is considered a stock settled
debt under ASC 480, all of which was amortized immediately as a non-cash expense charged to interest expense (see Note 4). The
principal amount and premium are included in short-term convertible debt in the accompanying unaudited balance sheet as of September
30, 2016.  

Thermomedics
Acquisition   

On
December 4, 2015, the Company entered into several agreements related to its acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock
of Thermomedics, Inc. ( Thermomedics ). One of those agreements was a Management Services and Control Agreement, dated
December 4, 2015 (the  Control Agreement ), between the Company, Thermomedics, and Sanomedics, Inc. ( Sanomedics ),
whereby PositiveID was appointed the manager of Thermomedics. In a separate agreement the Company entered into a First Amendment
to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Amendment ) with Sanomedics. The original Stock Purchase Agreement ( Purchase
Agreement ) was entered into on October 21, 2015, and defines the agreed upon terms of the Company s acquisition of
all of the common stock of Thermomedics from Sanomedics. As a result of the Company assuming control of Thermomedics on December
4, 2015, it determined, pursuant to ASC 805-10-25-6, that December 4, 2015 was the acquisition date of Thermomedics for accounting
purposes.  

The estimated purchase
price of the acquisition totaled $484,000, comprised of $175,000 in cash, Series J preferred stock consideration of $125,000,
and the fair value of the contingent consideration estimated at approximately $184,000. The fair value of the contingent consideration
was estimated based upon the present value of the expected future payouts of the contingent consideration and is subject to change
upon the finalization of the purchase accounting. 

On
December 4, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized and on December 7, 2015, the Company filed with the State of Delaware, a Certificate
of Designations of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series J Preferred Stock. The Series J Preferred Stock ranks; (a) senior
with respect to dividends and right of liquidation with the Company s common stock (b) pari passu with respect to dividends
and right of liquidation with the Company s Series I Convertible Preferred Stock; and (c) junior with respect to dividends
and right of liquidation to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company. Without the prior written consent of Holders
holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock, the Company may not issue any Preferred Stock that is
senior to the Series J Preferred Stock in right of dividends and liquidation. At any time after the date of the issuance of shares
of Series J Preferred Stock, the Corporation will have the right, at the Corporation s option, to redeem all or any portion
of the shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to 100% of the $1,000 per share stated value of the shares
being redeemed. Series J Preferred Stock is not entitled to dividends, interest and voting rights. The Series J Preferred Stock
is convertible into the Company s common stock, at stated value, at a conversion price equal to 100% of the arithmetic average
of the VWAP of the common stock for the fifteen trading days prior to the six-month anniversary of the Issuance Date.

On
August 25, 2016, PositiveID completed the acquisition and entered into an agreement with the Sanomedics and Thermomedics (the
 August Agreement ), which amends certain terms of the Purchase Agreement and terminates the Control Agreement. The
amendments to the Purchase Agreement include: (a) that any legal expense or losses incurred by PositiveID after June 30, 2016
related to the Exergen litigation shall have the effect of reducing any future earnouts that may be owed to the Sanomedics, dollar
for dollar; (b) PositiveID and the Sanomedics also agreed to settle the final closing net working capital adjustment through a
reduction of the Series J Preferred Stock shares to be released from escrow. As a result, the 125 shares of Preferred Series J
stock originally issued shall be released from escrow as follows: 71 shares to the Sanomedics and 54 shares returned to the Company s
treasury.  

As
of August 25, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Series J preferred stock consideration has a fair value of $71,000, and the estimated
fair value of the contingent consideration was nil based on the fair value analysis as of September 30, 2016. 

In
connection with the acquisition, the Company issued a Convertible Promissory Note to Keith Houlihan, the former CEO of the Sanomedics
and President of Thermomedics (the  Holder ), dated August 25, 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $75,000 (the
 Note ). The Note bears an interest rate of 5%, and is due and payable before or on August 25, 2017. The Note may
be converted by the Holder at any time after February 28, 2017 into shares of Company s common stock at a price equal to
a 10% discount to the average of the three lowest daily VWAPs (volume weighted average price) of the Company s common stock
as reported on the OTCQB for the 10 trading days prior to the day the Holder requests conversion. Any conversion will be limited
by: (i) Holder may not make more than one conversion every ten trading days, and (ii) the amount of conversion shares at any conversion
may not be more than the total number of shares of Common Stock traded over the ten trading days preceding the conversion notice
multiplied by 5%. The Note is a long-term debt obligation that is material to the Company. The Note may be prepaid in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Note. The Note also contains certain representations, warranties, and events of default including
if the Company fails to pay when due any amount owed on the Note, and increases in the amount of the principal and interest rates
under the Note in the event of such defaults. In the event of default, at the option of the Holder and in the Holder s sole
discretion, the Holder may consider the Note immediately due and payable. The Company recorded this expense of $75,000 in the
change in acquisition obligations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  

In
consideration for the Note, the Company entered into a Consent and Release by and between the Company, Thermomedics, the Holder
and Vitacura LLC, a Florida limited liability corporation ( Vitacura ), which is wholly owned by the Holder (the  Release ),
pursuant to which the Holder and Vitacura agreed to release the Company and Thermomedics from any and all causes of action.  

In
connection with the acquisition, additional earn-out payments of up to $750,000 for each of the fiscal years ending December 31,
2016 and 2017 may be earned by the Thermomedics if certain revenue thresholds are met as described in the Purchase Agreement.
Such earn-out payments, if any, will consist of 25% in cash, up to $187,000 and 75% and in shares of preferred stock of the Company,
up to 563 shares of Preferred Stock, for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The Company
recorded a contingent earn-out liability of $184,000, as a non-current liability, as reflected in the consolidated as of December
31, 2015. The Company adjusted the contingent earn-out liability to its fair value during the three months ended September 30,
2016. As of September 30, 2016, the estimated value of the earnout liability was nil.  

Accordingly,
the Company reduced other assets by $12,000, reduced goodwill by $17,000, reduced Preferred Series J by $54,000, reduced the contingent
earn-out liability by $184,000 and recognized a net gain of $209,000 included in change in acquisition obligations in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.  

The
Company acquired Thermomedics for a number of reasons including the quality of its Caregiver  product, its prospects for sales
and profit growth, its management team strengths in sales and marketing FDA cleared medical devices, and their regulatory experience.  

Under
the acquisition method of accounting, the estimated purchase price of the acquisitions was allocated to net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and liabilities of Thermomedics and ENG assumed based on their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values
of certain assets and liabilities have been estimated by management and are subject to change upon the finalization of the fair
value assessments.

Sale
and License of VeriChip and GlucoChip Businesses   

In
a series of transactions between 2012 and 2014 PositiveID first licensed and subsequently sold all of the intellectual property
related to its VeriChip and GlucoChip implantable microchip business to VeriTeQ Corporation, a business run by a former related
party (CEO of the Company through 2011). The final agreement in the series was the GlucoChip Agreement, dated October 20, 2014.
Between 2014 and 2015 the Company also advanced funds to VeriTeQ pursuant to the GlucoChip Agreement. As a result of these agreements,
we hold a warrant and convertible notes in VeriTeQ as described below.  

The
Company holds a five-year warrant dated November 13, 2013, with original terms entitling the Company to purchase 300,000 shares
of VeriTeQ common stock at a price of $2.84. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, in particular the full quantity and pricing
reset provisions, the warrant had an original dollar value of $852,000 and can be exercised using a cashless exercise feature.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the warrant had remaining dollar value of $728,827. As of September 30, 2016 the
Company had outstanding convertible notes receivable from VeriTeQ of $781,635 which includes default principal and interest of
which a full reserve has been established as noted below. Pursuant to the warrant the Company realized $319,000 of other income
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

On
October 19, 2015, VeriTeQ received a default notice from its senior lender demanding repayment of approximately $2.1 million of
indebtedness, secured by substantially all of VeriTeQ s assets, which VeriTeQ was unable to repay. VeriTeQ also received
a Notice of Disposition of Collateral advising the Company that the senior lender, acting as collateral agent, intended to sell
the assets at auction, which it did on November 4, 2015. VeriTeQ has ceased its business operations related to implantable medical
device identification. On November 25, 2015, VeriTeQ entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an unaffiliated company whereby
VeriTeQ agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of that company. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 the Company did not have an opportunity to sell any of its holdings in VeriTeQ. On May 6, 2016 VeriTeQ completed
the closing pursuant to the November 25, 2015 Stock Purchase agreement.  

As
VeriTeQ is an early stage company, not yet fully capitalized, the Company plans to continue to fully reserve all note receivable
and warrant balances. If and when proceeds are realized in the future, gains will be recognized.

Stockholder s Deficit   

On
August 26, 2011, the Company s stockholders approved and adopted the PositiveID Corporation 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the
 2011 Plan ). The 2011 Plan provides for awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted
stock awards, performance units, performance shares, SARs and other stock-based awards to employees and consultants. Under the
2011 Plan, up to 1 million shares of common stock may be granted pursuant to awards.  

On
June 27, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split in the ratio of 1-for-50 and the Company
filed the Eighth Certificate of Amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to affect the reverse stock split. The reverse split only affected outstanding common
stock and the number of authorized shares was not adjusted.  

On
July 5, 2016, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of PositiveID Corporation, as amended, became
effective and the Company effected a 1-for-50 reverse stock split (the  Reverse Stock Split ) of the Company s
outstanding common stock (the  Common Stock ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each 50 shares of the Company s
issued and outstanding Common Stock automatically, and without any action on the part of the respective holders, became one (1)
issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. No scrip or fractional share certificates were issued in connection with the Reverse
Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would have been entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of shares
of the Company s common stock not evenly divisible by the reverse split ratio will be entitled, upon surrender of certificate(s)
representing such shares, to a cash payment in lieu thereof. The cash payment will equal the product obtained by multiplying (a)
the fraction to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled by (b) the per share closing sales price of the Company s
Common Stock on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split (see Note 1 and Note 5). All share and per share data in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been retrospectively restated for the effects of this reverse stock split.  

A
summary of option activity outside the Company s stock incentive plans as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the
nine months ended is presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts):  

The
Black-Scholes model, which the Company uses to determine compensation expense, requires the Company to make several key judgments
including:  

the
    value of the Company s common stock;   

the
    expected life of issued stock options;   

the
    expected volatility of the Company s stock price;   

the
    expected dividend yield to be realized over the life of the stock option; and   

the
    risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the stock options.

CORPORATION   

   Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

   September
30, 2016   

   (Unaudited)   

The
Company s computation of the expected life of issued stock options was determined based on historical experience of similar
awards giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations about employees 
future length of service. The interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The computation
of volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock.  

During
the quarter ended March 31, 2016, 1,316 vested shares of the Company s common stock was returned by a former affiliate.  

The
Company issued 728,700 shares, with a grant date fair value of approximately $157,000, to consultants for services rendered during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 40 million shares were issued in connection with conversion of approximately
$3,270,000 of convertible promissory notes (see Note 4).  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 928,000 options have been granted outside of the Company s plans of which 800,000
options were issued to executive management (see Note 8), 16,000 options to an employee and 112,000 options to consultants, pursuant
to the agreements. These options have vesting periods between 0 to 4 years and a total grant date fair value of $848,929 of which
$28,709 were immediately expensed and the remaining will be expense over the vesting period of the options.  

As
of September 30, 2016, 294,028 warrants to purchase the Company s common stock have been granted outside of the Company s
plans, which remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016. These warrants were granted at exercise prices ranging from $0.75 to
$37.5 per share, 238,028 warrants are fully vested and 56,000 warrants will vest upon completion of services. These warrants exercisable
for a period from five to seven years. Included in the 294,028 outstanding warrants are 23,000 warrants with a grant date fair
value of $21,175, issued as compensation for professional services during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company recorded an expense related to stock options, restricted stock issued, and issuance of Series I Preferred to employees
and advisors of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively
and approximately $0.8 million and $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $0.5 million of unamortized compensation related to stock option and restricted
share grants. This compensation will be amortized as operating expense over the remainder of 2016 through 2019.  

As
of September 30, 2016, 0.3 million options were issued under the Thermomedics 2015 plan to employees and consultant. These options
had a grant date fair value of $109,600 and will be expensed over the 1 year vesting period of the options.  

Series
I and Series II Preferred Stock   

As
of December 31, 2015, the Company had 2,500 shares of Series I Preferred Stock authorized and 2,025 issued and outstanding. The
Series I Preferred Stock was mandatorily redeemable and had a stated value per share of $1,000, a dividend rate of 6% per annum,
voting rights on an as-converted basis and a conversion price equal to the closing bid price of the Company s common stock
on the date of issuance. The Series I Preferred Stock was required to be redeemed (at stated value, plus any accrued dividends)
by the Company after three years or any time after one year, the Company may at its option, redeem the shares subject to a 10-day
notice (to allow holder conversion). The Series I Preferred Stock was convertible into the Company s common stock, at stated
value plus accrued dividends, at the closing bid price on the day issued, any time at the option of the holder and by the Company
in the event that the Company s closing stock price exceeds 400% of the conversion price for 20 consecutive trading days.
The Company had classified the Series I Preferred Stock as a liability in the audited condensed consolidated balance sheet due
to the mandatory redemption feature. The Series I Preferred Stock had voting rights equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
that Series I Preferred Stock is convertible into, times twenty-five. The holders of Series I Preferred Stock, which were held
entirely by the Board of Directors and management of the Company had voting control in situations requiring shareholder vote.

CORPORATION   

   Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

   September
30, 2016   

   (Unaudited)   

On
July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors ( Board ) of PositiveID authorized a Certificate of Designations of Preferences,
Rights and Limitations of Series II Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Certificate ). The Certificate was filed with
the State of Delaware Secretary of State on July 25, 2016. The Series II Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series II )
ranks: (a) senior with respect to dividends and right of liquidation with the Common Stock, par value $0.01 ( Common Stock );
(b) pari passu with respect to dividends and right of liquidation with the Corporation s Series I Convertible Preferred
Stock ( Series I ) and Series J Convertible Preferred Stock; and (c) junior to all existing and future indebtedness
of the Company. The Series II has a stated value per share of $1,000, subject to adjustment as provided in the Certificate (the
 Stated Value ), and a dividend rate of 6% per annum of the Stated Value. The Series II Preferred Stock has voting
rights equal to the number of shares of Common stock that Series II Preferred Stock is convertible into times twenty five. The
Series II is subject to redemption (at Stated Value, plus any accrued, but unpaid dividends (the  Liquidation Value ))
by the Company no later than three years after a Deemed Liquidation Event and at the Company s option after one year from
the issuance date of the Series II, subject to a ten-day notice (to allow holder conversion). The Series II is convertible at
the option of a holder or if the closing price of the Common Stock exceeds 400% of the Conversion Price for a period of twenty
consecutive trading days, at the option of the Company. Conversion Price means a price per share of the Common Stock equal to
100% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock during the subsequent 12 months following the date
the Series II was issued.  

On
August 11, 2016, the Company entered an exchange agreements with all of the Series I holders exchanging Series II Preferred shares
with an identical face value. The Board of PositiveID agreed to exchange 2,025 shares of its Series I, which shares have a stated
value of $2,025,000 and redemption value of $2,277,329, held by its directors, officers and management, for 2,262 shares of Series
II (the  Exchange ). Pursuant to the Exchange each existing holder of Series I exchanged their Series I shares for
Series II shares having equivalent stated value, maintaining the same voting rights as they had as holders of the Series I. Both
the Series I and the Series II have a stated value per share of $1,000, and a dividend rate of 6% per annum. All shares of Series
I previously issued have become null and void and any and all rights arising thereunder have been extinguished. The Series II
is only forfeitable after the exchange date up to January 1, 2019 upon termination for cause and is subject to acceleration in
the event of conversion, redemption and certain events.  

Accounting
guidance under ASC 718 dictates that the incremental difference in fair value of Series II and Series I should be recorded as
stock-based compensation expense. As a result of the independent valuation performed, we have recorded the Series II at the fair
value of $2,306,345. The Series I had a fair valued of $281,345, resulting in a charge of $2,025,000 recorded as stock based compensation.
Additionally, the Series I liability was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital.  

6.
Taxes   

The
Company had an effective tax rate of nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company incurred
losses before taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. However, it has not recorded a tax benefit
for the resulting net operating loss carryforwards, as the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance against its
net deferred tax assets was appropriate based primarily on its historical operating results.  

In
July 2008, the Company completed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of Xmark to Stanley. In January 2010, Stanley
received a notice from the Canadian Revenue Agency ( CRA ) that the CRA would be performing a review of Xmark s
Canadian tax returns for the periods 2005 through 2008. This review covers all periods that the Company owned Xmark. The review
performed by CRA resulted in an assessment of approximately $1.4 million, in 2011.  

On
January 20, 2012, the Company received an indemnification claim notice from Stanley related to the matter. The Company did not
agree with the position taken by the CRA, and filed a formal appeal related to the matter on March 8, 2012. In addition, on March
28, 2012, Stanley received assessments for withholding taxes on deemed dividend payments in respect of the disallowed management
fee totaling approximately $0.2 million, for which we filed a formal appeal on June 7, 2012. In October 2012, the Company submitted
a Competent Authority filing to the U.S. IRS seeking relief in the matter. In connection with the filing of the appeals, Stanley
was required to remit an upfront payment of a portion of the tax reassessment totaling approximately $950,000. The Company has
also filed a formal appeal related to the withholding tax assessments, pursuant to which Stanley was required to remit an additional
upfront payment of approximately $220,000. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 7, 2012, the Company has agreed to repay
Stanley for the upfront payments, plus interest at the rate of five percent per annum. To the extent that the Company and Stanley
reach a successful resolution of the matter, or any part of the matter, through the appeals process, the upfront payment (or a
portion thereof) will be returned to Stanley or the Company as applicable. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had made payments
to Stanley of $665,777 and Stanley had received refund from the CRA of 129,520. Based on management s estimate, including
reconciling to Stanley s accounts, the Company has a recorded tax contingency liability of $144,000 in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016.

Commitments and Contingencies   

Lease
Commitments   

The
Company leases certain office space under non-cancelable operating leases, including the Company s corporate offices in
Delray Beach, Florida under a lease scheduled to expire in October 18, 2018, lab and office space in Pleasanton, California a
lease scheduled to expire in September 30, 2018 and office and manufacturing space in Concord, California which is currently on

ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Exergen
Litigation   

On
October 10, 2012, Thermomedics and its former parent company, Sanomedics (together  Sano ), received a cease and desist
demand letter from Exergen Corporation ( Exergen ), claiming that Sano infringed on certain Exergen patents relating
to Sano s non-contact thermometers. On May 21, 2013, Exergen filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of the District
of Massachusetts against Sano. On September 3, 2013, Sano filed its answer to Exergen s complaint and asserted counterclaims
and affirmative defenses for non-infringement and invalidity of certain patents. On March 26, 2015, Exergen and Sano filed a partial
dismissal that removes Sano s previous product, the Talking Non-Contact Thermometer, from the lawsuit. On September 15,
2015, the United States District Court   District of Massachusetts, entered an order granting Sano s motion for summary
judgment, ruling that the patent claims made by Exergen against Sano were invalid. On June 22, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals
affirmed the United States District Court   District of Massachusetts  summary judgment decision in favor of Thermomedics
that the patent claims asserted against Thermomedics by Exergen are invalid. The period for Exergen to object has expired.   

Other
Legal Proceedings   

The
Company is a party to certain legal actions, as either plaintiff or defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business, none
of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.
However, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the costs and other effects of pending or future litigation, governmental
investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings, whether civil or criminal, settlements, judgments and investigations,
claims or charges in any such matters, and developments or assertions by or against the Company relating to the Company or to
the Company s intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, financial condition and operating results.  

Distributor
and Supplier Agreements   

Under
certain agreements the Company may be subject to penalties if they are unable to supply products under its obligations. Since
inception, the Company has never incurred any such penalties.

Employment Contracts and Stock Compensation to Related Parties   

On
April 8, 2016, the Company entered into employment contracts with both Mr. Caragol, the Company s CEO, and Mr. Probst, the
Company s President, effective January 1, 2016. The terms of Mr. Caragol s employment contract include a three-year
term and a salary of $275,000, with $75,000 of that salary deferred until such time as the Company s working capital is
sufficient to fund such payments. Mr Caragol s salary will automatically adjust to $350,000 at the time that PositiveID s
common stock is listed on a national exchange. Mr. Caragol is eligible for annual bonuses and was granted 500,000 stock options
(see Note 6), which vest; (i) 170,000 on January 1, 2017; (ii) 165,000 on January 1, 2018; and (iii) 165,000 on January 1, 2019.
These options will expire on January 1, 2021. The terms of Mr. Probst s employment contract include a three-year term and
a salary of $200,000. Mr Probst s salary will automatically adjust to $250,000 at the time that PositiveID s common
stock is listed on a national exchange. Mr. Probst is eligible for annual bonuses and was granted 300,000 stock options (see Note
6), which vest; (i) 102,000 on January 1, 2017; (ii) 99,000 on January 1, 2018; and (iii) 99,000 on January 1, 2019. These options
will expire on January 1, 2021.  

If
either Mr. Caragol or Mr. Probst s employment is terminated prior to the expiration of the term of his employment agreement,
certain significant payments become due. The amount of such payments depends on the nature of the termination. In addition, the
employment agreement contains a change of control provision that provides for the payment of 2.0 times and 2.95 times in the case
of Mr. Probst and Mr. Caragol, respectively of the then current base salary and the same multipliers of the highest bonus paid
to the executive during the three calendar years immediately prior to the change of control. Any outstanding stock options or
restricted shares held by the executive as of the date of his termination or a change of control become vested and exercisable
as of such date, and remain exercisable during the remaining life of the option. The employment agreement also contains non-compete
and confidentiality provisions which are effective from the date of employment through two years from the date the employment
agreement is terminated.

Segments   

The
Company operates in three business segments: Molecular Diagnostics, Medical Devices, and Mobile Labs.  

Molecular
Diagnostics   

The
Company develops molecular diagnostic systems for rapid medical testing and bio-threat detection. The Company s fully automated
pathogen detection systems and assays are designed to detect a range of biological threats. The Company s M-BAND (Microfluidic
Bio-agent Autonomous Networked Detector) system is an airborne bio-threat detection system developed for the homeland defense
industry to detect biological weapons of mass destruction. The Company is developing Firefly Dx, an automated pathogen detection
system for rapid diagnostics, both for clinical and point-of-need applications.  

Medical
Devices   

Through
its wholly owned Thermomedics subsidiary, the Company markets and sells the Caregiver  product. Caregiver is an FDA-cleared
for clinical use, infrared thermometer that measures forehead temperature in adults, children and infants, without contact. Caregiver
is the world s first clinically validated, non-contact thermometer for the healthcare providers market, which includes hospitals,
physicians  offices, medical clinics, nursing homes and other long-term care institutions, and acute care hospitals. Our
Caregiver thermometer with TouchFree  technology is less likely to transmit infectious disease than devices that require
even minimal contact. It therefore saves medical facilities the cost of probe covers ($0.05 to $0.10 per temperature reading),
storage space and disposal costs.  

Mobile
Labs   

Our
subsidiary, ENG Mobile Systems, is a leader in the specialty technology vehicle market, with a focus on mobile laboratories, command
and communications applications, and mobile cellular systems. ENG builds mobile laboratories specifically designed for chemical
and biological detection, monitoring and analysis. ENG also provides specialty vehicle manufacturing for TV news vans and trucks,
emergency response trailers, mobile command centers, infrared inspection, and other special purpose vehicles.  

During
2015, the Company operated in a single segment. The following is the selected segment data as of and for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016:

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   

This Quarterly Report on Form
10Q (this  Report ) contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects
and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunities, our business
and growth strategies, our projected revenue and expense levels, possible future consolidated results of operations, the adequacy
of our available cash resources, our financing plans, our competitive position and the effects of competition and the projected
growth of the industries in which we operate, as well as the following statements:  

the expectation
    that operating losses will continue for the near future, and that until we are able to achieve profits, we intend to continue
    to seek to access the capital markets to fund the development of our products;   

that we seek to
    structure our research and development on a project basis to allow management of costs and results on a discrete short term
    project basis, the expectation that doing so may result in quarterly expenses that rise and fall depending on the underlying
    project status, and the expectation that this method of managing projects may allow us to minimize our firm fixed commitments
    at any given point in time;   

that we intend to
    continue to explore strategic opportunities, including potential acquisition opportunities of businesses that are complementary
    to ours;   

that we do not anticipate
    declaring any cash dividends on our common stock;   

that our ability
    to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing to fund the continued development of our
    products and working capital requirements;   

that our current
    cash resources, our expected access to capital under existing financing arrangements, and, if necessary, delaying and/or reducing
    certain research, development and related activities and costs, that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our working
    capital requirements for the near-term future;   

that our products
    have certain technological advantages, but maintaining these advantages will require continual investment in research and
    development, and later in sales and marketing;   

that if any of our
    manufacturers or suppliers were to cease supplying us with system components, we would be able to procure alternative sources
    without material disruption to our business, and that we plan to continue to outsource any manufacturing requirements of our
    current and under development products;   

that the medical
    application of our Firefly Dx product will require FDA clearance or CLIA waiver;   

that Firefly Dx
    would enable accurate diagnostics leading to more rapid and effective treatment than what is currently available with existing
    systems;    

that the combination
    of PositiveID s expert bio-detection technologies with ENG s advanced mobile labs is expected to offer customers
    a next generation, best of breed solution in the mobile laboratory space;   

that our M-BAND
    product is well positioned to compete for the next generation BioWatch system;   

that M-BAND was
    developed in accordance with DHS guidelines;    

that our Caregiver
    thermometer with TouchFree  technology is less likely to transmit infectious disease than devices that require even
    minimal contact.    

that ENG s
    MobiLab  Systems have become the primary choice of mobile labs for scientific and environmental agencies and organizations
    throughout the country because of their productivity in the field;    

that we will receive
    royalties related to our license of the  iglucose    technology to Smart Glucose Meter Corp ( SGMC )
    for up to $2 million based on potential future revenues of glucose test strips sold by SGMC.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the

as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

Overview   

PositiveID
is a life sciences and technology company operating in three segments: Molecular Diagnostics, Medical Devices, and Mobile Labs.  

In
its Molecular Diagnostics segment, since its inception (including prior to acquisition of its wholly owned subsidiary), PositiveID,
has received over $50 million in government grants and contract work for the Department of Defense, DHS, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and industrial
clients. The Company s M-BAND (Microfluidic Bio-agent Autonomous Networked Detector) system is an airborne bio-threat detection
system developed for the homeland defense industry, to detect biological weapons of mass destruction. PositiveID is also developing
the Firefly Dx, an automated pathogen detection system for rapid diagnostics, both for clinical and point of need applications.
PositiveID has a substantial portfolio of intellectual property related primarily to sample preparation and rapid medical testing
applications.  

On
December 4, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement giving it complete operational control of Thermomedics, Inc. and its FDA-cleared
Caregiver    product. Caregiver  is a clinical grade, infrared thermometer for measurement of forehead temperature
in adults, children, and infants, without contact. It delivers an oral-equivalent temperature directly from the forehead in 1-2
seconds. Since there is no skin contact and Caregiver  does not require probe cover supplies, it reduces the risk of cross-contamination,
which is an increasing concern, and saves healthcare facilities the cost of covers. The results of the Caregiver business are
included in the Medical Devices segment. The Company completed the acquisition of the capital stock of Thermomedics on August
25, 2016.  

On
December 24, 2015, the Company acquired E-N-G Mobile Systems, Inc. ( ENG ), a leader in mobile labs, homeland security
and communications vehicles. The largest and fastest growing aspect of ENG s business over the last decade has been its
mobile labs segment, which includes chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosives testing in the field. ENG designs
and builds these labs to customer specification in its facilities in Concord, California. The results of ENG are included in the
Mobile Labs Segment.

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

During
2015, the Company operated in a single segment. The following is the selected segment data for the three months ended September
30, 2016.  

Revenue   

We
reported revenue of $1.1 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized the deferred revenue of $2.5 million received in conjunction
with the Boeing License Agreement in 2012. The revenue generated during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily
due to the acquisition of ENG and Thermomedics in December 2015, resulting in the Medical Device and Mobile Labs segments reporting
for the entire three months ended September 30, 2016. Revenue in the Mobile Lab segment is recorded at the completion and delivery
of mobile lab and telecommunications vehicles. As individual projects are usually material, revenues from quarter to quarter can
vary materially based on the timing of such deliveries.  

Cost
of Revenue and Gross Profit   

Cost
of revenue consist of inventory cost and compensation expense for employees and consultants working directly on the Company s
revenue generating products and agreements. Cost of revenue was $527,000 and nil for three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Gross profit decreased from $2.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $538,000 in the three
months ended September 30, 2016. The change in cost of revenue and gross profit was attributable to the recognition of the Boeing
license revenue and the Company s acquisition of ENG and Thermomedics in December 2015, resulting in the Medical Device
and Mobile Labs segments reporting for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense   

Selling,
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation for employees in executive, sales, marketing and operational
functions, including finance and accounting and corporate development. Included in selling, general and administrative expense
is all non-cash, equity based compensation. Other significant costs include depreciation and amortization, professional fees for
accounting and legal services, consulting fees and facilities costs.  

Selling,
general and administrative expense increased by $2.9 million, or 395%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock based compensation of
$2 million and in marketing overhead, and other selling, general and administrative costs at our Mobile Lab and Medical Device
segments, which were both acquired in December 2015.  

Research
and Development   

Our
research and development expense consists primarily of labor (both internal and contract) and materials costs associated with
various development projects, including testing, developing prototypes and related expenses. Our research and development costs
include payments to our development partners and acquisition of in process research and development. We seek to structure our
research and development on a project basis to allow the management of costs and results on a discrete short term project basis.
This may result in quarterly expenses that rise and fall depending on the underlying project status. We expect this method of
managing projects to allow us to minimize our firm fixed commitments at any given point in time.  

Research
and development expense decreased by approximately $267,000, or 59%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in labor, and engineering costs
related to the development of Firefly Dx product. The Company does not expect to increase its research and development expenses
until it arranges contractual or strategic arrangements to share in the costs of that development.  

Change
in Fair Value of Embedded Conversion Option Liability   

The
change in fair value of embedded conversion option liability decreased by approximately $1.3 million or 500%, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change was primarily attributed to the revaluation
of the fair value of the embedded conversion option liability charged to other expense and the change in the fair-value of the
derivative liability in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This is a non-cash income/expense item.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense increased by approximately $1.2 million or 108%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributed to the amortization of fair value premiums and debt discounts
related to the increased level of borrowing, through convertible notes, the three months ended September 30, 2016. The amortization
of fair value premiums and debt discounts are non-cash income/expense items.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

During
2015, the Company operated in a single segment. The following is the selected segment data for the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

Revenue   

We
reported revenue of $4.6 million and $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $2.5 million of the revenue was from the Boeing License Agreement. The increased revenue
was attributable to the Company s acquisition of ENG and Thermomedics in December 2015, resulting in the Medical Device
and Mobile Labs segments reporting for the entire nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s current revenues are
primarily generated from its Mobile Labs segment. Such revenue is recorded at the completion and delivery of mobile lab and telecommunications
vehicles. As individual projects are usually material, revenues from quarter to quarter can vary materially based on the timing
of such deliveries.  

Cost
of Revenue and Gross Profit   

Cost
of revenue consist of inventory cost and compensation expense for employees and consultants working directly on the Company s
revenue generating products and agreements. Cost of revenue was $2.8 million and $0.1 million for nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross profit decreased from $2.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.7
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The change in cost of revenue and gross profit was attributable to the recognition
of the Boeing license in 2015 and Company s acquisition of ENG and Thermomedics in December 2015, resulting in the Medical
Device and Mobile Labs segments reporting for the entire nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense   

Selling,
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation for employees in executive, sales, marketing and operational
functions, including finance and accounting and corporate development. Included in selling, general and administrative expense
is all non-cash, equity based compensation. Other significant costs include depreciation and amortization, professional fees for
accounting and legal services, consulting fees and facilities costs.  

Selling,
general and administrative expense increased by $3.6 million, or 97%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock based compensation of $2
million and in marketing and overhead, netted by increased segment selling, general and administrative costs at our Mobile Lab
and Medical Device segments, which were both acquired in December 2015.  

Research
and Development   

Our
research and development expense consists primarily of labor (both internal and contract) and materials costs associated with
various development projects, including testing, developing prototypes and related expenses. Our research and development costs
include payments to our development partners and acquisition of in process research and development. We seek to structure our
research and development on a project basis to allow the management of costs and results on a discrete short term project basis.
This may result in quarterly expenses that rise and fall depending on the underlying project status. We expect this method of
managing projects to allow us to minimize our firm fixed commitments at any given point in time.  

Research
and development expense decreased by approximately $583,000, or 59%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in labor, and engineering costs
related to the development of Firefly Dx product. The Company does not expect to increase its research and development expenses
until it arranges contractual or strategic arrangements to share in the costs of that development.  

Change
in Fair Value of Embedded Conversion Option Liability   

The
change in fair value of embedded conversion option liability decreased by approximately $2.6 million or 224%, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributed to the revaluation
of the fair value of the embedded conversion option liability charged to other expense and the change in the fair-value of the
derivative liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This is a non-cash income/expense item.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense increased by approximately $2.5 million or 73%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributed to the amortization of fair value premiums and debt discounts
related to the increased level of borrowing, through convertible notes, the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The amortization
of fair value premiums and debt discounts are non-cash income/expense items.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, cash totaled $140,000 compared to cash of $173,000 at December 31, 2015.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $3.0 million and $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily to fund operating losses. This decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily
the result of decrease in operating costs related to the development of Firefly Dx product and Company marketing programs.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities   

Net
cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled approximately $(8,000) and $197,000, respectively, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash proceeds for 2015 primarily resulted from the net cash inflows from
the sales of the Company s warrant position in VeriTeQ.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

Financing
activities provided cash of approximately $2.9 million and $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and debentures.  

Financial
Condition   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency of approximately $12 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately
$154 million, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $10.7 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately
$144 million as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to operating losses for the period, offset
by cash received from capital raised through convertible debt financings, that was spent on operations.  

We
have incurred operating losses since our inception. The current operating losses are the result of research and development expenditures,
selling, and general and administrative expenses related to our projects and products. We expect our operating losses to continue
through at least the next 12 months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing to fund the continued development of
our products and to support working capital requirements. Until we are able to achieve operating profits, we will continue to
seek to access the capital markets.  

During
2016 and 2017, we will need to raise additional capital, including capital not currently available under our current financing
agreements, in order to execute our business plan.  

The
Company intends to continue to access capital to provide funds to meet its working capital requirements for the near-term future.
In addition, and if necessary, the Company could reduce and/or delay certain discretionary research, development and related activities
and costs. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to negotiate additional sources of equity or credit
for its long term capital needs. The Company s inability to have continuous access to such financing at reasonable costs
could materially and adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and result in significant
dilution to the Company s existing stockholders. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to recoverability of assets and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls . We evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our  disclosure controls and procedures 
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation (the  disclosure controls
evaluation ) was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the person(s) performing
the function of our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and acting chief financial officer ( CFO ). Rules
adopted by the SEC require that in this section of this Report we present the conclusions of the CEO and CFO about the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 based on the disclosure controls evaluation.  

Objective
of Controls.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed so that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and acting CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and
management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls
and procedures.  

Conclusion .
Based upon the disclosure controls evaluation, our CEO and acting CFO had concluded that, as of September 30, 2016 our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the foregoing objectives are achieved.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

The
Company is a party to certain legal actions, as either plaintiff or defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business, none
of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. However,
litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the costs and other effects of pending or future litigation, governmental investigations,
legal and administrative cases and proceedings, whether civil or criminal, settlements, judgments and investigations, claims or
charges in any such matters, and developments or assertions by or against the Company relating to it or to its intellectual property
rights and intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition
and operating results.  

On
October 10, 2012, Thermomedics and its former parent company, Sanomedics (together  Sano ), received a cease and desist
demand letter from Exergen Corporation ( Exergen ), claiming that Sano infringed on certain Exergen patents relating
to Sano s non-contact thermometers. On May 21, 2013, Exergen filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of the District
of Massachusetts against Sano. On September 3, 2013, Sano filed its answer to Exergen s complaint and asserted counterclaims
and affirmative defenses for non-infringement and invalidity of certain patents. On March 26, 2015, Exergen and Sano filed a partial
dismissal that removes Sano s previous product, the Talking Non-Contact Thermometer, from the lawsuit. On September 15,
2015, the United States District Court   District of Massachusetts, entered an order granting Sano s motion for summary
judgment, ruling that the patent claims made by Exergen against Sano were invalid. On June 22, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals
affirmed the United States District Court   District of Massachusetts  summary judgment decision in favor of Thermomedics
that the patent claims asserted against Thermomedics by Exergen are invalid. The period for Exergen to object has expired.

       Remedies.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Secured

have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies
of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State, or of any jurisdiction in which Collateral is located, including,
without limitation, the right to take possession of the Collateral, and for that purpose the Secured Party may, so far as the
Debtor can give authority therefor, enter upon any premises on which the Collateral may be situated and remove the same therefrom.
The Secured Party may in its discretion require the Debtor to assemble all or any part of the Collateral at such location or locations
within the jurisdiction of the Debtor s principal office or at such other locations as the Secured Party may reasonably
designate. Unless the Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a
recognized market, the Secured Party shall give to the Debtor at least five Business Days prior written notice of the time and
place of any public sale of Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition is to be
made. The Debtor hereby acknowledges that five Business Days prior written notice of such sale or sales shall be reasonable notice.
In addition, the Debtor waives any and all rights that it may have to a judicial hearing in advance of the enforcement of any
of the Secured Party s rights hereunder, including, without limitation, its right following an Event of Default to take
immediate possession of the Collateral and to exercise its rights with respect thereto.  

17.       Standards
for Exercising Remedies.  To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Secured Party to exercise remedies in a commercially
reasonable manner, the Debtor acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for the Secured Party (a) to fail
to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Secured Party to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete
raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (b) to fail to obtain third-party
consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental
or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) to fail to exercise
collection remedies against account debtors or other persons obligated on Collateral or to remove liens or encumbrances on or
any adverse claims against Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies against account debtors and other persons obligated
on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) to advertise dispositions
of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature,
(f) to contact other persons, whether or not in the same business as the Debtor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all
or any portion of the Collateral, (g) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral,
whether or not the collateral is of a specialized nature, (h) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing Internet sites that provide
for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that
match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, to disclaim disposition
warranties, (k) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Secured Party against risks of loss, collection or
disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Secured Party a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral,
or (l) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Secured Party, to obtain the services of brokers, investment bankers, consultants
and other professionals to assist the Secured Party in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. The Debtor acknowledges
that the purpose of this  Section 17  is to provide nonexhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Secured
Party would not be commercially unreasonable in the Secured Party s exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that
other actions or omissions by the Secured Party shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated
in this  Section 17 . Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this shall be construed to grant any rights
to the Debtor or to impose any duties on the Secured Party that would not have been granted or imposed by this agreement or by
applicable law in the absence of this  Section 17 .  

18.       No
Waiver by Secured Party.  The Secured Party shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights upon or under the Obligations
or the Collateral unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the Secured Party. No delay or omission on the part of
the Secured Party in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver on any one occasion
shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any future occasion. All rights and remedies of the Secured Party
with respect to the Obligations or the Collateral, whether evidenced hereby or by any other instrument or papers, shall be cumulative
and may be exercised singularly, alternatively, successively or concurrently at such time or at such times as the Secured Party
deems expedient.  

19.       Suretyship
Waivers by Debtor . The Debtor waives demand, notice, protest, notice of acceptance of this agreement, notice of loans made,
credit extended, Collateral received or delivered or other action taken in reliance hereon and all other demands and notices of
any description. With respect to both the Obligations and the Collateral, the Debtor assents to any extension or postponement
of the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any security
interest in any Collateral, to the addition or release of any party or person primarily or secondarily liable, to the acceptance
of partial payment thereon and the settlement, compromising or adjusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at such time or
times as the Secured Party may deem advisable. The Secured Party shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of the
Collateral or any income thereon, nor as to the preservation of rights against prior parties, nor as to the preservation of any
rights pertaining thereto beyond the safe custody thereof as set forth in  Section 11.2.  The Debtor further waives any and
all other suretyship defenses.  

20.       Marshalling .
The Secured Party shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to this
Agreement and the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral
security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights hereunder and in respect of such collateral
security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising.
To the extent that it lawfully may, the Debtor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral
which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the Secured Party s rights under this agreement or under any other
instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any
of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, the Debtor hereby
irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.  

21.       Proceeds
of Dispositions; Expenses . The Debtor shall pay to the Secured Party on demand amounts equal to any and all expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by the Secured Party in protecting, preserving
or enforcing the Secured Party s rights under or in respect of any of the Obligations or any of the Collateral. After deducting
all of said expenses, the residue of any proceeds of collection or sale of the Obligations or Collateral shall, to the extent
actually received in cash, be applied to the payment of the Obligations in such order or preference as the Secured Party may determine,
proper allowance and provision being made for any Obligations not then due. Upon the final payment and satisfaction in full of
all of the Obligations and after making any payments required by    9-608(a)(1)(C) or 9-615(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial
Code of the State, any excess shall be returned to the Debtor, and the Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency in the payment
of the Obligations.  

22.       Overdue
Amounts.  Until paid, all amounts due and payable by the Debtor hereunder shall be a debt secured by the Collateral and shall
bear, whether before or after judgment, interest at the rate of interest set forth in the Credit Documents, promissory note and/or
loan agreement executed and delivered herewith.  

23.       Governing
Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.   THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO TAKE EFFECT AS A SEALED INSTRUMENT AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF  New York   The Debtor agrees that any suit for the enforcement
of this agreement may be brought in the courts of the State or any federal court sitting in the State of  New York  and consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and to service of process in any such suit being made upon the Debtor by mail at the
address set forth hereinabove .  The Debtor hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of
any such suit or any such court or that such suit is brought in an inconvenient court.  

24.       Waiver
of Jury Trial.   THE DEBTOR WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS.  Except
as prohibited by law, the Debtor waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding
sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages.
The Debtor (i) certifies that neither the Secured Party nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Secured Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that the Secured Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and
(ii) acknowledges that, in entering into the Credit Documents, and the other loan agreements to which the Secured Party is a party,
the Secured Party is relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this  Section 24 .  

25.       Miscellaneous.
 The headings of each section of this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not define or limit the provisions thereof.
This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding upon the Debtor and its respective successors and assigns,
and shall inure to the benefit of the Secured Party and its successors and assigns. If any term of this Agreement shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity of all other terms hereof shall in no way be affected thereby, and this
Agreement shall be construed and be enforceable as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term had not been included herein.
The Debtor acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Agreement.  

IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, intending to be legally bound, the Debtor has caused this Security Agreement to be duly executed as of the date
first above written.
