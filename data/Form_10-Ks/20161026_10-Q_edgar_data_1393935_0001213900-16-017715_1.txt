COMPANY
OVERVIEW   

Nature
of Operations   

THINSPACE
TECHNOLOGY, INC. (formerly Vanity Events Holding, Inc.) (the  Company ,  Thinspace   we ,
 us  or  our ), was organized as a Delaware corporation on August 25, 2004, and is a holding company.
We are a cloud computing company that develops software productivity solutions that allow our customers secure access to centrally
managed desktop or software applications and to work and collaborate from anywhere, accessing enterprise apps and data on any
of the latest devices, as easily as they would in their own office- simply and securely.  

The
Company s principal activity is the development and sale of network software. The Company has a desktop virtualization solution
suite, named skySpace, offering 5 key products:  

skyDesk
    - a simple management software solution for Microsoft remote desktop users.   

skyGate
      software solution that allows secure remote access to applications and data from outside of the corporate network.   

skyView
      provides access to applications or Windows desktops from a browser on any device, including iPad, iPhone or Android
    tablet or Smartphone.   

skyDirect
      a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) software solution that allows secure fast access to hosted virtual desktops.   

skyPoint
      A branded hardware thin client endpoint aimed for the enterprise and corporate market.   

We
sell directly to independent software vendors and Application Service Providers (ASPs) and to end users through a chain of distributors
and resellers. Our larger customers are predominantly large businesses based around the world, with a concentration in North America,
the Far East and India.  

Our
operating subsidiaries are Thinspace Technology Ltd ( Thinspace UK ), organized and operating in the United Kingdom,
and Thinspace Technology Ltd. ( Thinspace US ), a Nevada corporation formed on August 24, 2010 and operating in the
states of Florida and Texas.  

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN   

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and note disclosures
normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those
rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  

These
interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 are unaudited;
however, in the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary
to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. The results
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2015 or for any future period. All references to September 30, 2015 and 2014 in these footnotes are unaudited.  

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on March 31, 2015.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements
at that date but does not include all disclosures required by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  

Going
Concern    

As
of September 30, 2015 we have negative working capital of $7,871,309 and a stockholders  deficit of $7,818,926. Although
we had net income of $4,660,037 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, this was primarily the result of a noncash gain
of approximately $9 million from the change in value of our derivative liabilities. As a result, there is substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at September 30, 2015.  

Management
has implemented its business plan to add new products, increase marketing activities and, as a result, increase revenue. Our ability
to continue to implement our current business plan and continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent upon our ability to
obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies and to achieve profitable operations.  

There
can be no assurances that funds will be available to the Company when needed or, if available, that such funds will be available
under favorable terms. In the event that the Company is unable to generate adequate revenues to cover expenses and cannot obtain
additional funds in the near future, the Company may seek protection under bankruptcy laws. To date, management has not considered
this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence, since the Company is progressing with various potential
sources of new capital and we anticipate a successful outcome from these activities. However, capital markets remain difficult
and there can be no certainty of a successful outcome from these activities.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern.  

As
disclosed in Note 7, Subsequent Events, the Company has continued to fund its operations with proceeds from the sale of convertible
debt.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION   

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Thinspace Technology, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Thinspace UK and Thinspace US. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   

Accounts
receivable are reported at the customers' outstanding balances less any allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued
on overdue accounts receivable. The Company evaluates receivables on a regular basis for potential reserve. The accounts receivable
balances of $68,205 and $158,329 as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, do not include an allowance for
doubtful accounts as the Company anticipates payment on all accounts within the next fiscal year. The Company routinely evaluates
accounts receivable for uncollectible amounts.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

The
Company is party to certain volume licensing arrangements that include a perpetual license for current products combined with
rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which the Company has determined are additional software products
and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably
over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified
future versions of the software during the coverage period are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably
over the coverage period.  

Revenue
from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined
period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue
and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers.  

Some
volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted
for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted
for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.  

DEFERRED
REVENUE   

Deferred
revenue related to support and maintenance is recorded in a manner consistent with the Company s revenue recognition policy.
The Company typically enters into one-year upgrade and maintenance contracts with its customers. The upgrade and maintenance contracts
are generally paid in advance but can be billed monthly or quarterly. The Company defers such payments and recognizes revenue
ratably over the contract period.  

INVENTORY   

The
Company values its inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. The Company uses estimates and judgments regarding
the valuation of inventory to properly value inventory. Inventory adjustments are made for the difference between the cost of
the inventory and the estimated realizable value and charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which the facts that give
rise to the adjustments become known.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

Our
short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily
of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management s estimates, reasonably approximate
their book value. The fair value of our notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates
their book value based on their terms.  

Fair
value measurements   

ASC
820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure
about fair value measurements.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the amount that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes the following three levels of
inputs that may be used:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2   Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the assets or liabilities.  

In
accordance with ASC 820, the following table represents the Company's fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and (liabilities)
measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2015:  

The table below sets forth a summary of changes
in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities (conversion and warrant derivative liabilities) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for these items:  

Conversion
derivative liability    these instruments consist of certain of our notes which are convertible based on a discount to
the market value of our common stock. These instruments were valued using pricing models which incorporate the Company s
stock price, volatility, U.S. risk free rate, dividend rate and estimated life.  

CONVERTIBLE
INSTRUMENTS   

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional
standards for  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  ( ASC 815-40 ).  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when  Accounting for Convertible Securities with
Beneficial Conversion Features,  as those professional standards pertain to  Certain Convertible Instruments. 
Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options
embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment
date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements
are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary
deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between
the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price
embedded in the note. ASC 815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity s control
could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.  

DERIVATIVE
LIABILITIES   

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)
the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument
and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception
to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.  

CONCENTRATIONS
OF CREDIT RISK   

The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. At September 30, 2015, three customers accounted for 69% of accounts
receivable.  

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. Cash held in US bank accounts is insured up to
$250,000 at each institution. Cash held in UK bank accounts is insured up to  85,000 (approximately $129,000 at September
30, 2015) at each institution for each entity. At times, cash balances may exceed the insured limits. The Company has not experienced
any loss on these accounts. The balances are maintained in demand accounts to minimize risk.  

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT   

Expenses
related to present and future products are expensed as incurred.  

FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION   

The
financial statements of the Company s U.K. subsidiary, Thinspace UK, are measured using the British Pound as the functional
currency. Assets, liabilities and equity accounts of the company are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date
or historical acquisition date, depending on the nature of the account. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
of exchange in effect throughout the year. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded as a separate component
of stockholders' equity. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States of America dollars.  

INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE  

We
use ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  for calculating the basic and diluted income (loss) per share. We compute basic
income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding.  

Dilutive common stock equivalents consist of shares issuable upon conversion
of debt and preferred stock and the exercise of our stock warrants. There were 4,382,560,883 common share equivalents at September
30, 2015 and 270,375,324 at September 30, 2014. The 2014 common share equivalents have been excluded from the computation of the
weighted average diluted shares, as their inclusion would be antidilutive. 

Diluted earnings per share for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been calculated as follows:  

Additional
potentially dilutive shares of approximately 4 billion shares at September 30, 2015 have been excluded from the calculation since
they exceed authorized shares available.  

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
June 2014, ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU No. 2014-15 ) was issued.
Before the issuance of ASU 2014-15, there was no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
This guidance is expected to reduce the diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 requires management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that
are currently in U.S. auditing standards as specified in the guidance. ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for the annual period ending
after December 15, 2016  and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements
but the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  
( ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated
balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 becomes effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted. A reporting entity should apply the amendment prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently
evaluating the effects of adopting ASU 2015-17 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ). The amendments require all equity
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted
for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments also require
an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value
in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose
the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and the
requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed
for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. This guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will evaluate
the effects of adopting ASU 2016-01 if and when it is deemed to be applicable.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The main objective
of ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. To meet that objective, the FASB is amending the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creating Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment
to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU
2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. ASU 2016-09 is designed
to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions which include   the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations.
This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)   ( ASU
2016-10 ). The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-10 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers,  which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2016-10 are
the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. They are effective prospectively for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption
of these amendments on its consolidated financial statements.  

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers(Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients  . The amendments do not change the core revenue recognition principle in Topic 606. The amendments
provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. These amendments are effective at the
same date that Topic 606 is effective. Topic 606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein (i.e., January 1, 2018, for a calendar year
entity). Topic 606 is effective for nonpublic entities one year later. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the
adoption of the amendments to Topic 606 and these amendments on its consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would
have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The conversion features of the debentures
described above contain a variable conversion rate. As a result, we have classified the conversion features as derivative
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Upon issuance, we have recorded conversion feature liabilities of
$2,434,738. The value of the conversion feature liabilities was determined using an option valuation model based on the
following assumptions: (1) risk free interest rates of between 0.265 - 0.625%; (2) dividend yield of 0%; (3) volatility
factor of the expected market price of our common stock of between 165% - 210%; and (4) expected lives of 1   2.42
years. The Company has allocated $1,346,077 to debt discount, to be amortized over the life of the debt, with the balance of
$1,088,661 being charged to expense at issue. 

NOTE
4  DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   

The
Company has identified certain embedded derivatives related to its convertible debentures, convertible preferred stock and a debt
purchase agreement. Since certain of the debentures, the preferred stock and the debt settlement agreement are convertible into
a variable number of shares, the conversion features of those debentures are recorded as derivative liabilities. The accounting
treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception
date and to adjust to fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date.  

Convertible
Debentures and Debt Settlement Agreement   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $630,923 of principal and $54,128 of accrued interest was converted into 348,278,449
shares of common stock. The Company has recorded income of $2,596,238 and $2,222,937 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the conversion feature through the dates of conversion.  

At September 30, 2015, we recalculated
the fair value of the embedded conversion feature of our notes and debt settlement agreement subject to derivative accounting
and have determined that their fair value at September 30, 2015 was $3,281,889. The value of the conversion liabilities was
determined using an option valuation modelbased on the following assumptions: (1) risk free interest rate of 0.066% - 0.417%; (2)
dividend yield of 0%; (3) volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of between 191% - 248% and (4)
an expected life of 0.25   1.66 years. We recorded income of $28,249,012 and $4,814,818 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively, related to the change in fair value. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 we recorded additions to our derivative conversion liabilities related to the
conversion feature attributable to interest accrued during the period. These additions aggregated $96,767 and $798,408 for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which has been charged to interest expense.  

Convertible
Preferred Stock   

The
conversion feature of our Series B preferred stock has been adjusted due to the subsequent issuance of debt. As a result, the
conversion price is now $0.001755 per share, such that an aggregate of 42,735,043 shares of the Company s common stock are
issuable upon such conversion. The Company has recorded income of $234,162 and $333,112 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the conversion feature of the preferred stock through the dates
of adjustment. The Company has also recorded an expense of $22,911 and $336,197 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively, due to the increase in the fair value of the conversion feature as a result of the modification.  

At September 30, 2015, we recalculated
the fair value of the embedded conversion feature of our Series B and Series C preferred stock subject to derivative
accounting and have determined that the fair value at September 30, 2015 was $587,731. The value of the conversion
liabilities was determined using an option valuation model based on the following weighted average assumptions: (1) risk free
interest rate of 0.209%; (2) dividend yield of 0%; (3) volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of
191% and (4) an expected life of 1 year. We recorded income of $6,052,991 and $2,118,274 during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, related to the change in fair value.

30 days of receipt of funds from the customers. 

In addition, Mr. Bautista forfeited
the option to purchase Five Million (5,000,000) shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise price of $0.17 and

Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its operating subsidiaries, Thinspace UK and Thinspace US, unless the context otherwise
requires.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations
and assumptions. While there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting our financial statements, we believe the
following critical accounting policies involve the most complex, difficult and subjective estimates and judgments:  

Use
of Estimates - The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and, accordingly, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  

Going
Concern  -  The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and do not reflect any adjustments related
to the uncertainty surrounding our recurring losses or accumulated deficit  

Revenue
Recognition - We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605  Revenue Recognition . Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has transferred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed and
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on product sales transacted on a test or pilot
basis. Instead, receipts from these types of transactions offset marketing expenses.  

Deferred
Revenue - Deferred revenue related to support and maintenance is recorded in a manner consistent with the Company s revenue
recognition policy. The Company typically enters into one-year upgrade and maintenance contracts with its customers. The upgrade
and maintenance contracts are generally paid in advance but can be billed monthly or quarterly. The Company defers such payment
and recognizes revenue ratably over the contract period.   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments - Our short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and other liabilities,
consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management s estimates,
reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of the Company s derivative instruments is determined using option
pricing models.  

Convertible
Instruments - The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance
with professional standards for  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  ( ASC 815-40 ).  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when  Accounting for Convertible Securities with
Beneficial Conversion Features,  as those professional standards pertain to  Certain Convertible Instruments. 
Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options
embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment
date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements
are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary
deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between
the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price
embedded in the note. ASC 815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity s control
could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.  

Derivative
Liabilities - ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their
host instruments and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances
in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related
to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative
instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles
with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded
derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides
an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the Three Months ended September 30, 2014   

Revenues:  

Revenue
was $271,705 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to revenue of $2,322,170 for the three months ended September
30, 2014. Overall, our revenues decreased 88% for the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period. The decrease is primarily attributable
to the delivery of a large order during the 2014 period (representing approximately 76% of revenue).  

Cost
of goods sold  

Cost
of goods sold as a percent of revenue was 41% and 64% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cost
of goods sold consists of software development, purchased hardware and software costs and shipping costs. Cost of goods sold as
a percentage of revenue varies based on the various costs incurred, relative to the timing of the recognition of revenue.  

Operating
expense:  

Operating
expense decreased 72% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $429,356, compared to $1,507,661 for the three months
ended September 30, 2014. Our costs have decreased as we have curtailed expenses for consulting, compensation and other costs.
Included in our operating expenses for the three months of 2015 and 2014 is $70,459 and $421,212, respectively, of non-cash expense
for stock based compensation. The balance of our other operating expenses includes salaries, consulting, marketing and general
overhead expenses.  

We
expect that our operating expenses will ultimately increase as our business grows and we devote additional resources towards promoting
that growth, most notably reflected in anticipated increases in salaries for sales personnel and technical resources.   

Other
income (expense):  

We
had income from the change in the fair value of our derivative liabilities of $37,132,403 during the three months ended September
30, 2015 compared to expense of $16,556,422 during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The change in the fair value of
our derivative liabilities resulted primarily from the changes in our stock price and the volatility of our common stock during
the reported periods. Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of our derivative liabilities.  

We
reported gain from the conversion of debt of $58,019 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to gain of $20,979
during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The gain on debt conversion resulted from the issuance of shares of common stock
to pay off debt, based on the fair value of the shares issued as compared to the carrying value of the related debt. The closing
price on the date of conversion is used to compute the actual fair market value of our common stock in determining the amount
of the gain or loss.  

We
reported interest expense of $687,899 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared with interest expense of $1,883,300
during the three months ended September 30, 2014. Interest expense consists of derivative liabilities issued during the period
whose fair values exceeded the proceeds of the debt, aggregating $169,019 and $1,709,794 for the three months ended September
30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the expense associated with the price resets of certain of our derivative instruments, aggregating
$22,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The balance of the expense relates to the amortization of debt discount
and interest accrued on debt.  

Nine
Months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the Nine Months ended September 30, 2014   

Revenues:  

Revenue
was $1,394,704 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to revenue of $5,700,775 for the nine months ended September
30, 2014. Overall, our revenues decreased 76% for the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period. The decrease is primarily attributable
to the delivery of a large order during the 2014 period (representing approximately 67% of revenue).  

Cost of goods sold  

Cost
of goods sold as a percent of revenue was 40% and 58% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cost
of goods sold consists of software development, purchased hardware and software costs and shipping costs. Cost of goods sold as
a percentage of revenue varies based on the various costs incurred, relative to the timing of the recognition of revenue.  

Operating
expense:  

Operating
expense decreased 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $2,374,629, compared to $4,796,831 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2014. Our costs have decreased as we have curtailed expenses for consulting, compensation and other costs.
Included in our operating expenses for the first nine months of 2015 and 2014 is $267,352 and $1,607,178, respectively, of non-cash
expense for stock based compensation. The balance of our other operating expenses includes salaries, consulting, marketing and
general overhead expenses.   

We
expect that our operating expenses will increase as our business grows and we devote additional resources towards promoting that
growth, most notably reflected in anticipated increases in salaries for sales personnel and technical resources.  

Other
income (expense):  

We
had income from the change in the fair value of our derivative liabilities of $9,489,141 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015 compared to expense of $15,447,215 during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The change in the fair value of our
derivative liabilities resulted primarily from the changes in our stock price and the volatility of our common stock during the
reported periods. Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of our derivative liabilities.  

We
reported gain from the conversion of debt of $80,676 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to gain of $176,108
during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The gain on debt conversion resulted from the issuance of shares of common stock
to pay off debt, based on the fair value of the shares issued as compared to the carrying value of the related debt. The closing
price on the date of conversion is used to compute the actual fair market value of our common stock in determining the amount
of the gain or loss.  

We
reported interest expense of $3,369,249 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared with interest expense of $7,354,199
during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Interest expense consists primarily of derivative liabilities issued during the
period whose fair values exceeded the proceeds of the debt, aggregating $1,887,069 and $5,616,678 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the expense associated with the price resets of certain of our derivative instruments, aggregating
$336,197 and $1,033,365, respectively. The balance of the expense relates to the amortization of debt discount and interest accrued
on debt.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. As of September 30, 2015 we had approximately
$49,000 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $7,871,309 (including derivative liabilities aggregating
$3,869,620), as compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $136,000 and a working capital deficit of $14,661,201 at
December 31, 2014. Our recent sources of operating capital have been debt financings. We received proceeds from convertible and
other notes aggregating $1,440,650 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Cash Provided by Operating Activities   

We
used $1,340,228 of cash in our operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1,716,990 used
by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in net cash used results primarily from
the net changes in other current assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in net loss of $180,152 (after adjusting
for non-cash expenses).  

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities   

We
incurred costs of $6,249 for the purchase of furniture and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared
to $18,421 used for the purchase of furniture and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received $1,440,650 from the sale of notes and convertible securities. We repaid
$172,761 of notes and loans payable and paid $11,050 of accrued preferred stock dividends.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we received $472,000 from the sale of our preferred stock, $1,191,000 from the sale
of notes and convertible debentures and $21,000 from stockholder advances. We repaid $86,583 of notes and loans payable and repaid
$118,670 of shareholder advances.  

We
presently do not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. We will need additional capital
in order to continue operations until we are able to achieve positive operating cash flow. Additional capital is being sought,
but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such investments. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity
or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading price of our common stock
and a downturn in the equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity
or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, we may incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect
significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. If additional financing
is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail our operations.  

As disclosed in Note 7,
Subsequent Events, the Company has continued to fund its operations with proceeds from the sale of convertible debt. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities in which we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained
interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities
or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market
risk or credit risk support.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Not
required for a smaller reporting company.  

Item
4.Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )
are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
(the  SEC ) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive and financial officer), of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and also are not effective in ensuring that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2015, which continue to exist
as of September 30, 2015.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by
paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

We
are not party to any material legal proceedings and no property of the Company is subject to any material legal proceedings.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

Not
required for a smaller reporting company.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

During the three months ended Sept ember
30, 2015, we issued 245,785,886 shares of common stock upon the conversion of $280,005.31 of note principal and interest.     

Item
3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   

The
Company is in default on outstanding convertible notes, issued between June 4, 2010 and April 10, 2015, in the aggregate principal
amount of $3,181,167, due to failure to maintain a sufficient number of shares of common stock reserved for conversion. As a result
of such defaults, the interest rate on these convertible notes has increased from between 6 to 10% to between 8 and 18%.
