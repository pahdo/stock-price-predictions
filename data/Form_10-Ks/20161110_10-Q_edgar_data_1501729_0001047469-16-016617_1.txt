    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)     

Note 1. Principal Business and Organization     

FS Energy and Power Fund, or the Company, was formed as a Delaware statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on September 16, 2010 and formally commenced investment
operations on July 18, 2011 upon raising gross proceeds in excess of $2,500, or the minimum offering requirement,
from sales of its common shares of beneficial interest, or common shares, in its continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with the Company or the Company's investment adviser, FS
Investment Advisor, LLC, or FS Advisor, a private investment firm that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, and an
affiliate of the Company.   

          The
Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. The Company is an externally
managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated investment
company, or RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had eight wholly-owned financing
subsidiaries, seven wholly-owned subsidiaries through which it holds interests in certain portfolio companies and one wholly-owned subsidiary through which it expects to hold interests in certain
portfolio companies. The unaudited consolidated financial statements include both the Company's accounts and the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes.   

          The
Company's investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in privately-held U.S. companies in the energy and power
industry. The Company's investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its total assets in securities of energy and power related, or Energy, companies. The Company
considers Energy companies to be those companies that engage in the exploration, development, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storage, refining, distribution, mining, generation or
marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined products, coal or power, including those companies that provide equipment or services to companies engaged in any of the foregoing.   

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

           Basis of Presentation:       The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. For a more complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other information, the Company's interim
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the

  has
evaluated the impact of subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.   

Use of Estimates:       The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Many of the amounts have been rounded, and all amounts are in thousands, except share and per share
amounts.   

            Capital Gains Incentive Fee:       The Company entered into an investment advisory and administrative services agreement with FS Advisor,
dated as of
April 28, 2011, which was amended on August 10, 2012, and which, as amended, is referred to herein as the investment advisory and administrative services agreement. Pursuant to the terms
of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of
such agreement). Such fee equals 20.0% of the Company's incentive fee capital gains (i.e., the Company's realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of
the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive
fees. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.   

While
the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with FS Advisor neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital
gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, or AICPA, for investment companies, the Company includes unrealized
gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to FS Advisor as if
the Company's entire
portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though FS Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are
actually realized.   

           Subordinated Income Incentive Fee:       Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FS Advisor may also be
entitled to
receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company's "pre-incentive fee net
investment income" for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital equal to 1.625% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of
6.5%. As a result, FS Advisor does not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.625%. For
purposes of this fee, "adjusted capital" means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company's common shares (including proceeds from its distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for
distributions from non-liquidating dispositions of the Company's investments paid to shareholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program. Once the
Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FS Advisor is entitled to a "catch-up" fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income
in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.031%, or 8.125% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FS Advisor is entitled to
receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income.

            Offering Costs:       The Company's offering costs primarily include, among other things, marketing expenses and printing, legal and due
diligence fees and
other costs pertaining to the Company's continuous public offering of its common shares. Historically, the Company charged offering costs against capital in excess of par value on its consolidated
balance sheets. Following discussions with the Staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC, the Company determined to change its accounting treatment of offering costs and defer and
amortize such costs as an expense over twelve months. The Company evaluated this change in accounting treatment of offering costs, which it implemented effective January 1, 2016, and determined
that it did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

            Reclassifications:       Certain amounts in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015
may have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used to prepare the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. These
reclassifications had no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as previously reported.   

          In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,    Interest Imputation of
Interest,    or ASU 2015-03, to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under pre-existing guidance, debt issuance costs were recognized as a
deferred charge and presented as an asset on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability for indebtedness be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15,     Interest Imputation of
Interest   , or ASU 2015-15, to update the guidance to include SEC staff views regarding the presentation and subsequent
measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit
arrangements, the SEC indicated that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over
the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.   

Commencing
January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and changed its method of disclosing debt issuance costs incurred in connection with its repurchase agreement entered
into in connection with its financing arrangement with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, or Goldman, and its multiple draw term loan agreement entered into in connection with its financing arrangement with
Fortress Credit Co LLC, or Fortress. ASU 2015-03 affects the presentation and disclosure of such costs in the Company's financial statements. There is no change to the Company's recognition and
measurement of debt issuance costs. In accordance with ASU 2015-15, the Company elected to continue to present debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset, which is
unchanged from its prior method of disclosure.   

          Comparative
financial statements of prior interim and annual periods have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively. The adoption and retrospective adjustment of ASU 2015-03
had no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as previously reported.

Note 3. Share Transactions     

Below is a summary of transactions with respect to the Company's common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Status of Continuous Public Offering     

          Since commencing its continuous public offering and through October 25, 2016, the Company sold 444,115,900 common shares (as adjusted for
share distributions) for gross proceeds of $4,319,069, including common shares issued under its distribution reinvestment plan. As of October 25, 2016, the Company had raised total gross
proceeds of $4,339,273, including $200 of seed capital contributed by the principals of FS Advisor in December 2010 and $20,004 in proceeds raised from the principals of FS Advisor, other individuals
and entities affiliated with FS Advisor, certain members of the Company's board of trustees and certain individuals and entities affiliated with GSO Capital Partners LP, or GSO, the Company's
investment sub-adviser, in a private placement conducted in April 2011 (see Note 4).   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company sold 65,945,030 and 60,310,131 common shares for gross proceeds of $476,714 and $562,353, respectively, at an
average price per share of $7.23 and $9.32, respectively. The gross proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include reinvested shareholder distributions of
$132,928 and $111,606, respectively, for which the Company issued 19,503,968 and 13,030,574 common shares, respectively. During the period from October 1, 2016 to October 25, 2016, the
Company sold 1,968,410 common shares for gross proceeds of $16,037 at an average price per share of $8.15.   

          The
proceeds from the issuance of common shares as presented on the Company's unaudited consolidated statements of changes in net assets and unaudited consolidated statements of cash
flows are presented net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees of $30,047 and $39,760 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Based
on and subject to market conditions and the pace of capital raising, the Company expects to close its public offering to new investors in mid to late November 2016.   

Share Repurchase Program     

          The Company intends to conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to its share repurchase program. The Company's board of trustees will consider
the following factors, among others, in making its determination regarding whether to cause the Company to offer to repurchase common shares and under what
terms:  

the effect of such repurchases on the Company's qualification as a RIC (including the consequences of any necessary asset sales);

the liquidity of the Company's assets (including fees and costs associated with disposing of assets);    
            the Company's investment plans and working capital requirements;   
            the relative economies of scale with respect to the Company's size;   
            the Company's history in repurchasing common shares or portions thereof; and   
            the condition of the securities markets.    

The
Company currently intends to limit the number of common shares to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of common shares it can repurchase with the proceeds it
receives from the issuance of common shares under its distribution reinvestment plan. At the discretion of the Company's board of trustees, the Company may also use cash on hand, cash available from
borrowings and cash from the liquidation of securities investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase common shares. In addition, the Company will limit the number of common shares
to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 2.5% in each quarter, though the actual number of common shares
that the Company offers to repurchase may be less in light of the limitations noted above.   

          On
October 13, 2016, the Company amended the terms of its share repurchase program, or the amended share repurchase program, which will first be effective for the Company's
quarterly repurchase offer for the fourth quarter of 2016. Prior to the amendment of the share repurchase program, the Company offered to repurchase common shares at a price equal to 90% of the
offering price in effect on the date of repurchase. Under the amended share repurchase program, the Company intends to offer to repurchase common shares at a price equal to the price at which common
shares are issued pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan on the distribution date coinciding with the applicable share repurchase date. The price at which common shares are issued
under the Company's distribution reinvestment plan is determined by the Company's board of trustees or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, and will be (i) not less than the net asset
value per common share as determined in good faith by the Company's board of trustees or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, immediately prior to the payment date of the distribution and
(ii) not more than 2.5% greater than the net asset value per common share as of such date. The Company's board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any
time, upon 30 days' notice.   

          The
following table provides information concerning the Company's repurchases of common shares pursuant to its share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015:

Note 3. Share Transactions (Continued)    

          On
October 5, 2016, the Company repurchased 2,983,921 common shares (representing 100% of common shares tendered for repurchase and 0.69% of the shares outstanding as of such
date) at $7.425 per share for aggregate consideration totaling $22,156.   

Note 4. Related Party Transactions     

Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager     

          Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FS Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of
the average value of the Company's gross assets and an incentive fee based on the Company's performance. The Company commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative services
agreement on July 18, 2011, upon commencement of the Company's investment operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears.   

          The
incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in
arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company's "pre-incentive fee net investment income" for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted
capital, equal to 1.625% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 6.5%. As a result, FS Advisor does not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company's pre-incentive fee net
investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.625%. For purposes of this fee, "adjusted capital" means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company's common shares
(including proceeds from its distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for distributions from non-liquidating dispositions of the Company's investments paid to shareholders and amounts paid for share
repurchases pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program. Once the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FS Advisor is entitled to a
"catch-up" fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals
2.031%, or 8.125% annually, of adjusted capital. This "catch-up" feature allows FS Advisor to recoup the fees foregone as a result of the existence of the hurdle rate. Thereafter, FS Advisor is
entitled to receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income.   

          The
second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon
termination of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of the Company's
incentive fee capital gains, which equal the Company's realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized
capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. The Company accrues for the capital gains
incentive fee, which, if earned, is paid annually. The Company accrues the capital gains incentive fee based on net realized and unrealized gains; however, under the terms of the investment advisory
and administrative services agreement, the fee payable to FS Advisor is based on realized gains and no such fee is payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually
realized.   

          Pursuant
to an investment sub-advisory agreement between FS Advisor and GSO, or the sub-advisory agreement, GSO will receive 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FS
Advisor under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with respect to each year.   

The
Company reimburses FS Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations, including FS Advisor's allocable portion of the
compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of Franklin Square Holdings, L.P., or FS Investments, the Company's sponsor and an affiliate of FS Advisor, providing administrative
services to the Company on

  behalf
of FS Advisor. The amount of the reimbursement payable to FS Advisor is the lesser of (1) FS Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the
Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS Advisor is required to allocate the cost of such services to the
Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Company's board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses
are allocated to the Company and the proposed allocation of the administrative expenses among the Company and certain affiliates of FS Advisor. The Company's board of trustees then assesses the
reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to the Company based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining
similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Company's board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing
all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Company's board of trustees, among other things, compares the total amount paid to FS Advisor for such services as a percentage of the
Company's net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. The Company will not reimburse FS Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation,
utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS Advisor.   

Under
the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Company, either directly or through reimbursement to FS Advisor or its affiliates, is responsible for its
organization and offering costs in an amount up to 1.5% of gross proceeds raised in the Company's continuous public offering. Organization and offering costs primarily include legal, accounting,
printing and other expenses relating to the Company's continuous public offering, including costs associated with technology integration between the Company's systems and those of its selected
broker-dealers, marketing expenses, salaries and direct expenses of FS Advisor's personnel, employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in registering and marketing the Company's common
shares, which includes the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating the marketing process for the Company.   

          Prior
to satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement and for a period of time thereafter, FS Investments funded certain of the Company's organization and offering costs. Following
this period, the Company paid certain of its organization and offering costs directly and reimbursed FS Advisor for offering costs incurred by FS Advisor on the Company's behalf, including marketing
expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FS Advisor's personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the Company's common shares. Organization and offering
costs funded directly by FS Investments were recorded by the Company as a contribution to capital. These offering costs were offset against capital in excess of par value on the consolidated financial
statements and organization costs were charged to expense as incurred by the Company. All other offering costs, including costs incurred directly by the Company, amounts reimbursed to FS Advisor for
ongoing offering costs and any reimbursements paid to FS Investments for organization and offering costs previously funded, are recorded as a reduction of capital. Commencing January 1, 2016,
offering costs incurred by the Company are deferred and amortized as an expense over twelve months (see Note 2).   

          The
dealer manager for the Company's continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, LLC (formerly FS 2  Capital Partners, LLC), or FS Investment
Solutions, which is one of the Company's affiliates. Under the dealer manager agreement among the Company, FS Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, or the dealer manager agreement, FS Investment
Solutions is entitled to receive sales commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of common shares in the Company's continuous public offering, all or a portion of which may be
re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives.

          The
following table describes the fees and expenses accrued under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and the dealer manager agreement during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

(1)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $53,977 and $56,049, respectively, in base management fees were paid to FS Advisor. As of
September 30, 2016, $20,086 in base management fees were payable to FS Advisor.
      (2)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $17,822 and $21,499, respectively, of subordinated incentive fees on income were paid to FS Advisor.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have a subordinated incentive fee on income payable to FS Advisor.
      (3)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $2,784 and $2,940, respectively, of the accrued administrative services expenses related to the
allocation of costs of administrative personnel for services rendered to the Company by FS Advisor and the remainder related to other reimbursable expenses. The Company paid $3,201 and $2,979 in
administrative services expenses to FS Advisor during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
      (4)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred offering costs of $3,600 and $7,150, respectively, of which $3,320 and $3,873,
respectively, related to reimbursements to FS Advisor for offering costs incurred on the Company's behalf, including marketing expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FS Advisor's personnel
and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the Company's common shares. See Note 2 for a discussion regarding the Company's change in accounting treatment of
offering costs.
      (5)    Represents
aggregate dealer manager fees retained by FS Investment Solutions and not re-allowed to selected broker-dealers or financial representatives.    

Capital Contribution by FS Advisor and GSO     

          In December 2010, Michael C. Forman and David J. Adelman, the principals of FS Advisor, contributed an aggregate of $200 to purchase 22,444
common shares (as adjusted for share distributions) at $8.91 per share, which represents the initial public offering price (as adjusted for share distributions), net of selling commissions and dealer
manager fees. The principals have agreed not to tender these common shares for repurchase as long as FS Advisor remains the Company's investment adviser.   

          In
April 2011, pursuant to a private placement, Messrs. Forman and Adelman agreed to purchase, through affiliated entities controlled by each of them, 224,444 additional common
shares (as adjusted for share distributions) at $8.91 per share (as adjusted for share distributions). The principals have agreed not to tender these common shares for repurchase as long as FS Advisor
remains the Company's investment adviser. In connection with the same private placement, certain members of the Company's board of trustees and other individuals and entities affiliated with FS
Advisor agreed to purchase 1,459,320 common shares (as adjusted for share distributions), and certain individuals and

  entities
affiliated with GSO agreed to purchase 561,111 common shares (as adjusted for share distributions), in each case at a price of $8.91 per share (as adjusted for share distributions). In
connection with the private placement, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,244,875 common shares (as adjusted for share distributions) for aggregate proceeds of $20,004, upon satisfaction of the
minimum offering requirement on July 18, 2011. As of October 25, 2016, the Company has issued an aggregate of 5,754,140 common shares (as adjusted for share distributions) for aggregate
gross proceeds of $48,311 to members of its board of trustees and individuals and entities affiliated with FS Advisor and GSO, including common shares sold to Messrs. Forman and Adelman in
December 2010 and common shares sold in the private placement conducted in April 2011.   

Potential Conflicts of Interest     

          FS Advisor's senior management team is comprised of substantially the same personnel as the senior management teams of FB Income
Advisor, LLC, FSIC II Advisor, LLC, FSIC III Advisor, LLC, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC and FS Global Advisor, LLC, the investment advisers to FS Investments' other
affiliated BDCs and affiliated closed-end management investment company. As a result, such personnel provide investment advisory services to the Company and each of FS Investment Corporation, FS
Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund. While none of FS Advisor, FB Income Advisor, LLC, FSIC II
Advisor, LLC, FSIC III Advisor, LLC, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC or FS Global Advisor, LLC is currently making private corporate debt investments for clients other than the
Company, FS Investment Corporation, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund, respectively,
any, or all, may do so in the future. In the event that FS Advisor undertakes to provide investment advisory services to other clients in the future, it intends to allocate investment opportunities in
a fair and equitable manner consistent with the Company's investment objectives and strategy, if necessary, so that the Company will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other client of FS Advisor
or its management team. In addition, even in the absence of FS Advisor retaining additional clients, it is possible that some investment opportunities may be provided to FS Investment Corporation, FS
Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and/or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund rather than to the Company.   

Exemptive Relief     

          As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to
co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may,
simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. In an order dated June 4, 2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting the Company, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of FS Advisor, including FS Investment
Corporation, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV, and any future BDCs that are advised by FS Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers, or
collectively the Company's co-investment affiliates. The Company believes this relief has and may continue to enhance its ability to further its investment objectives and strategy. The Company
believes this relief may also increase favorable investment opportunities for the Company, in part, by allowing it to participate in larger investments, together with the Company's co-investment
affiliates, than would be available to it if such relief had not been obtained. Because the Company did not seek exemptive relief to engage in co-investment transactions with its investment
sub-adviser, GSO, and its affiliates, it will continue to be permitted to co-invest with GSO and its affiliates only in accordance with existing regulatory guidance (e.g., where price is the
only negotiated term).

Expense Reimbursement     

          Pursuant to an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement, amended and restated as of May 16, 2013, or, the expense
reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders will
be paid from its offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments the Company may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other
distributions to the Company that are treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital for
tax purposes to the extent that the Company may use such dividends or other distribution proceeds to fund its distributions to shareholders. Under those circumstances, FS Investments will not
reimburse the Company for the portion of such distributions to shareholders that represent a return of capital for tax purposes, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement arrangement is not to
prevent tax-advantaged distributions to shareholders.   

          Under
the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments will reimburse the Company quarterly for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between the Company's cumulative
distributions paid to its shareholders in each quarter, less the sum of the Company's net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to the Company
on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in each
quarter.   

          Pursuant
to the expense reimbursement agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by FS Investments under such agreement if
(and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of the Company's net investment company taxable
income, net capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not
included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the distributions paid by the Company to its shareholders; provided, however, that (i) the Company will only
reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter beginning on or after July 1, 2013 to the extent that the payment of such
reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause "other operating expenses" (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support
payments received by the Company during such fiscal year) to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of the Company's average net assets attributable to its common shares for the fiscal year-to-date
period after taking such payments into account and (B) the percentage of the Company's average net assets attributable to its common shares represented by "other operating expenses" during the
fiscal year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense
support payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year) and (ii) the Company will not reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments if the aggregate
amount of distributions per share declared by the Company in such calendar quarter is less than the aggregate amount of distributions per share declared by the Company in the calendar quarter in which
FS Investments made the expense support payment to which such reimbursement relates. The Company is not obligated to pay interest on the payments it receives from FS Investments. "Other operating
expenses" means the Company's total "operating expenses" (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, organization and offering expenses, financing fees and costs, interest
expense, brokerage

and extraordinary expenses. "Operating expenses" means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with GAAP for investment companies.   

          The
Company or FS Investments may terminate the expense reimbursement agreement at any time. The specific amount of expenses reimbursed by FS Investments, if any, will be determined at
the end of each quarter. Upon termination of the expense reimbursement agreement by FS Investments, FS Investments will be required to fund any amounts accrued thereunder as of the date of
termination. Similarly, the Company's conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the expense reimbursement agreement shall survive the termination of such agreement by
either party.   

          FS
Investments is controlled by the Company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, and the Company's vice-chairman, David J. Adelman. There can be no
assurance that the expense reimbursement agreement will remain in effect or that FS Investments will reimburse any portion of the Company's expenses in future quarters.   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had no reimbursements due from FS Investments and no further amounts remained subject to repayment by the Company to FS Investments in the
future.   

FS Benefit Trust     

          On May 30, 2013, FS Benefit Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust for the purpose of awarding equity incentive compensation to
employees of FS Investments and its affiliates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, FS Benefit Trust purchased $142 and $104, respectively, of the Company's common shares
at a purchase price equal to 90% of the public offering price in effect on the applicable purchase date.   

Note 5. Distributions     

The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that the Company declared and paid on its common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

The
Company has adopted an "opt in" distribution reinvestment plan for its shareholders. As a result, if the Company makes a cash distribution, its shareholders will receive
distributions in cash unless they specifically "opt in" to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional common shares. However, certain state
authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a shareholder's ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan.   

In
connection with the anticipated closing of the Company's public offering, the Company further amended and restated its distribution reinvestment plan, or the amended distribution
reinvestment plan, which will first apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions paid on or after November 30,

Note 5. Distributions (Continued)    

  2016.
Prior to the amendment to the distribution reinvestment plan, the Company authorized and declared ordinary cash distributions on a weekly basis and paid such distributions on a monthly basis. On
October 3, 2016 and October 26, 2016 the Company's board of trustees declared regular weekly cash
distributions for October 2016 and November 2016, respectively. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to shareholders of record as of weekly record dates previously determined by the
Company's board of trustees in the amount of $0.013625 per share. Following the closing of the Company's public offering, the Company intends to declare regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis
and pay such distributions on a monthly basis. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company's
board of trustees.   

          The
Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from
operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common
equity investments in portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from FS Investments. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make
distributions.   

          For
a period of time following commencement of the Company's continuous public offering, substantial portions of the Company's distributions were funded through the reimbursement of
certain expenses by FS Investments and its affiliates, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees by FS Advisor, that were subject to repayment by the Company within three years.
The purpose of this arrangement was to ensure that no portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders was paid from offering proceeds or borrowings. Any such distributions funded through
expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory fees were not based on the Company's investment performance.   

No
portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 was funded through the reimbursement of operating expenses by FS Investments. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repay any amounts to FS Investments for expenses previously reimbursed or waived. There can be no assurance that the
Company will continue to achieve the performance necessary to sustain its distributions or that the Company will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all. FS Investments and its
affiliates have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods.

Note 5. Distributions (Continued)    

The
following table reflects the sources of the cash distributions on a tax basis that the Company paid on its common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015:   

(1)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 81.5% and 89.9%, respectively, of the Company's gross investment income on a tax basis was
attributable to cash income earned and 5.0% and 0.1%, respectively, was attributable to non-cash income earned. In addition, 10.6% and 8.2%, respectively, was attributed to paid-in-kind, or PIK,
interest and 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively, was attributed to accretion of discount during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     

The
Company's net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $198,465 and $164,105, respectively. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,972 and $15,496, respectively, of undistributed ordinary income on a tax basis and distributable income received from a limited partnership interest.
During the last twelve months, the Company's distributions exceeded tax-basis net investment income by $7,558. Over the same period, $15,728 of the Company's tax-basis net investment income was
generated by fee income, which is generally non-recurring in nature and the full amount of which is recorded as revenue when earned. Excluding fee income from net investment income during the last
twelve months, the Company would have had distributions in excess of tax-basis net investment income of $23,286. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 or 2015 was funded from offering proceeds or borrowings.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company saw positive developments in its investment portfolio and a subsequent increase in its net asset value. However,
certain investments in the portfolio were restructured or experienced defaults due to the recently depressed prices of oil and natural gas, and the Company may experience additional restructurings or
defaults in the future. These restructurings and defaults may have an impact on the level of income received by the Company. As a result, the Company is evaluating the current distribution rate
payable on its common shares and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain a weekly cash distribution amount of $0.013625 per common share (or the quarterly equivalent
thereto following the closing of the Company's public offering). FS Advisor will waive its incentive fees and may waive a portion of its management fee through the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure
that no portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders is paid from offering proceeds or borrowings.   

The
difference between the Company's GAAP-basis net investment income and its tax-basis net investment income was primarily due to the reclassification of unamortized original issue
discount and

fees recognized upon prepayment of loans from income for GAAP purposes to realized gains for tax purposes, the impact of certain subsidiaries that are consolidated for purposes of computing
GAAP-basis net investment income but are not consolidated for purposes of computing tax-basis net investment income and income recognized for tax purposes on certain transactions but not recognized
for GAAP purposes.   

          The
following table sets forth a reconciliation between GAAP-basis net investment income and tax-basis net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015:   

The
determination of the tax attributes of the Company's distributions is made annually as of the end of the Company's fiscal year based upon the Company's taxable income for the full
year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of the Company's distributions for a full
year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders are reported to shareholders annually on Form 1099-DIV.   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the components of accumulated earnings (deficit) on a tax basis were as follows:   

(1)    Under
the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, net capital losses recognized for tax years beginning after December 22, 2010, may be
carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term or long-term capital losses, as applicable. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had
capital loss carryforwards available to offset future capital gains of $338,153 and $200,191, respectively.
      (2)    As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the gross unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments and unrealized gain on foreign currency
was $142,743 and $44,089, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the gross unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments and unrealized loss on foreign
currency was $470,208 and $876,009, respectively.

Note 5. Distributions (Continued)     

The aggregate cost of the Company's investments for federal income tax purposes totaled $4,079,222 and $3,895,733 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. The aggregate net
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on a tax basis was $(327,465) and $(831,920) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of $47,450 and $23,252, respectively, resulting from unrealized appreciation on
investments held by the Company's wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries and deferred tax assets of $80,945 and $33,224, respectively, resulting from net operating and capital losses of the Company's
wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, certain wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries anticipated that they would be unable to fully utilize their
generated net operating and capital losses, therefore the deferred tax assets were offset by valuation allowances of $33,495 and $9,972, respectively. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company did not record a provision for taxes related to wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries.   

Note 6. Investment Portfolio     

The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

(1)    Amortized
cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on investments.    

As
of September 30, 2016, except for FourPoint Energy, LLC, in which the Company held a senior secured bond and four equity/other investments, Sunnova Energy Corp., in
which the Company held two equity/other investments, Sunnova Asset Portfolio 5 Holdings, LLC, in which the Company held a first lien senior secured loan, Titan Energy Operating, LLC, in
which the Company held a second lien senior secured loan and an equity/other investment, and Lusk Operating LLC, in which the Company held a first lien senior secured loan and an equity/other
investment, the Company was not an "affiliated person" of any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, except for Lusk Operating LLC, in which
the Company held a first lien senior secured loan and an equity/other investment, the Company did not "control" any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act.   

          As
of December 31, 2015, except for FourPoint Energy, LLC, in which the Company held a senior secured bond and two equity/other investments, Sunnova Holdings, LLC,
in which the Company held one equity/other investment and its wholly-owned subsidiary Sunnova Asset Portfolio 5 Holdings, LLC, in which the Company held one first lien senior secured loan, the
Company was not an "affiliated

of any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2015, except for Sunnova Holdings, LLC, in which the Company held one equity/other investment
and its wholly-owned subsidiary Sunnova Asset Portfolio 5 Holdings, LLC, in which the Company held one first lien senior secured loan, the Company did not "control" any of its portfolio
companies, as defined in the 1940 Act.   

          In
general, under the 1940 Act, the Company would be presumed to "control" a portfolio company if it owned more than 25% of its voting securities or it had the power to exercise control
over the management or policies of a portfolio company, and would be an "affiliated person" of a portfolio company if it owned 5% or more of its voting securities.   

          The
Company's investment portfolio may contain loans or bonds that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, or other investments, pursuant to which the Company
may be required to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had two senior secured
loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $13,696 and three equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $8,924. As of September 30, 2016, these unfunded
equity/other investments were BL Sand Hills Unit, L.P., net profits interest, BL Sand Hills Unit, L.P., overriding royalty interest and Synergy Offshore LLC. As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had four senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $67,365, one senior secured bond investment with an unfunded commitment of $18,470
and five equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $33,890. As of December 31, 2015, these unfunded equity/other investments were Altus Power America Holdings, LLC,
BL Sand Hills Unit, L.P., net profits interest, BL Sand Hills Unit, L.P., overriding royalty interest, Sunnova Holdings, LLC and Synergy Offshore LLC. The Company maintains
sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.   

          The
table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015:   

Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments     

Under existing accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. This accounting guidance emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use

  in
pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The Company classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following
hierarchy as defined by current accounting guidance:   

            Level 1:       Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2:       Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.   

            Level 3:       Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability.   

          A
financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's investments were categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:   

The
Company's investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Seventeen senior secured loan investments,
two senior secured bond investments and six subordinated debt investments were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other
factors, the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the debt. Twenty-nine
of the Company's equity/other investments were valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights
ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in
limited instances, book value or liquidation value. One equity/other investment, which was traded on an active public market, was valued at its closing price as of September 30, 2016. Except as
described above, the Company valued its other investments, including two of its equity/other investments, by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the
relevant period end, which were provided by an independent third-party pricing service and screened for validity by such service.   

The
Company's investments as of December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Twenty senior secured loan investments, two
senior secured bond investments and five subordinated debt investments were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other
factors, the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the debt. All of the
Company's equity/other investments were valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to
such investments,

well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Except as described above, the Company valued
its other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent third-party pricing service
and screened for validity by such service.   

          The
Company periodically benchmarks the bid and ask prices it receives from the third-party pricing service and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which the Company
purchases and sells its investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of the Company's management in purchasing and selling these investments, the Company believes
that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), the Company believes that
these valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company may also use other methods, including the use of independent valuation firms, to determine fair
value for securities for which it cannot obtain prevailing bid and ask prices through third-party pricing services or independent dealers or where the Company's board of trustees otherwise determines
that the use of such other method is appropriate. The Company periodically benchmarks the valuations provided by the
independent valuation firms against the actual prices at which it purchases and sells its investments. The valuation committee of the board of trustees, or the valuation committee, and the board of
trustees reviewed and approved the valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with the Company's valuation policy.   

The
following is a reconciliation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of investments for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in
determining fair value:

using a market quotes valuation technique were valued by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant
period end, which were provided by an independent third-party pricing service and screened for validity by such service. For investments utilizing a market comparables valuation technique, a
significant increase (decrease) in the market yield, in isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in any of the valuation
multiples, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. For investments utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease)
in the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

          The

BNP Facility     

          On December 11, 2013, Berwyn Funding LLC, or Berwyn Funding, the Company's wholly-owned, special-purpose financing subsidiary,
entered into a committed facility arrangement, or the BNP facility, with BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage, Inc., or BNP. As amended to date, Berwyn Funding can borrow, from time to time, up to
$300,000 from BNP. The BNP facility was effected through a committed facility agreement by and between Berwyn Funding and BNP, or the committed facility agreement, a U.S. PB Agreement by and between
Berwyn Funding and BNP and a special custody and pledge agreement by and among Berwyn Funding, BNP and State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street, as custodian, each dated as of
December 11, 2013, as amended to date, and which are collectively referred to herein as the BNP financing agreements.   

          The
Company may contribute securities to Berwyn Funding from time to time, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the committed facility agreement, and will retain a residual
interest in any securities contributed through its ownership of Berwyn Funding or will receive fair market value for any securities sold to Berwyn Funding. Berwyn Funding may purchase additional
securities from various sources. Berwyn Funding has appointed the Company to manage its portfolio of securities pursuant to the terms of an investment management agreement. Berwyn Funding will pledge
certain of its securities as collateral to secure borrowings under the BNP facility. Such pledged securities will be held in a segregated custody account with State Street. The value of securities
required to be pledged by Berwyn Funding is determined in accordance with the margin requirements described in the BNP financing agreements. Berwyn Funding's obligations to BNP under the facility are
secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Berwyn Funding, including its portfolio of securities. The obligations of Berwyn Funding under the facility are
non-recourse to the Company and the Company's exposure under the facility is limited to the value of the Company's investment in Berwyn Funding. On May 4, 2016, Berwyn Funding entered into an
amendment to the BNP financing arrangements that permits Berwyn Funding to enter into trades, including but not limited to purchasing options, through the prime brokerage arrangement provided under
the BNP financing arrangements.   

          Borrowings
under the BNP facility accrue interest at a rate equal to three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.10% per annum. Berwyn Funding is required to pay a
non-usage fee of 0.55% per annum to the extent the aggregate principal amount available under the facility is not borrowed. On May 4, 2016, Berwyn Funding entered into an amendment to the BNP
facility which will increase the (i) interest rate payable on borrowings to LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum effective on and after January 2, 2017 and (ii) the commitment fee payable
on all unused amounts to, effective on and after January 2, 2017, (a) 0.65% per annum on unused amounts so long as 75% or more of the facility amount is utilized or (b) 0.85% per
annum on unused amounts if less than 75% of the facility amount is utilized. Berwyn Funding may terminate the committed facility agreement upon 270 days' notice. Subject to certain cancellation
rights, and absent a default or facility termination event, BNP is required to provide Berwyn Funding with 270 days' notice prior to terminating or amending the committed facility agreement.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $113,737 was outstanding under the BNP facility. The carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair
value. The Company incurred costs of $449 in connection with obtaining and amending the facility, which the Company recorded as deferred financing costs on its consolidated balance sheets and
amortized to interest expense over the 270 day period following the closing date of the BNP facility or the amendment thereto, as applicable. As of September 30, 2016, all of the
deferred financing costs had been amortized to interest expense.

Note 8. Financing Arrangements (Continued)    

          For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of total interest expense for the BNP facility were as follows:   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the cash paid for interest expense, average borrowings, effective interest rate and weighted average interest rate for the
BNP facility were as follows:   

(1)    Interest
under the BNP facility is paid monthly in arrears.     

Under
the terms of the BNP financing agreements, BNP has the ability to borrow a portion of the pledged collateral, or, collectively, the rehypothecated securities, subject to certain
limits. Berwyn Funding may designate any security within the pledged collateral as ineligible to be a rehypothecated security, provided there remain securities eligible to be rehypothecated within the
segregated custody account in an amount equal to the outstanding borrowings owed by Berwyn Funding to BNP. Berwyn Funding may recall any rehypothecated security at any time and BNP must return such
security or an equivalent security within a commercially reasonable period. In the event BNP does not return the security, Berwyn Funding will have the right to, among other things, apply and set off
an amount equal to 100% of the then-current fair market value of such rehypothecated securities against any outstanding borrowings owed to BNP under the facility. Rehypothecated securities are
marked-to-market daily and if the value of all rehypothecated securities exceeds 100% of the outstanding borrowings owed by Berwyn Funding under the facility, BNP may either reduce the amount of
rehypothecated securities to eliminate such excess or deposit into the segregated custody account an amount of cash equal to such excess. Berwyn Funding will continue to receive interest and the
scheduled repayment of principal balances on rehypothecated securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Berwyn Funding received a fee of $0 and $1, respectively, from BNP
for securities that had been rehypothecated pursuant to the BNP financing agreements. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of those securities rehypothecated by
BNP was $111,168 and $108,340, respectively.   

Borrowings
of Berwyn Funding will be considered borrowings by the Company for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs.

  times,
most recently, to set the maximum commitments under the facility at $315,000 and extend the maturity date to June 11, 2017.   

Under
the Deutsche Bank credit facility, the Company has transferred from time to time cash or securities to FSEP Funding as a contribution to capital and retains a residual interest in
the contributed cash or securities through the Company's ownership of FSEP Funding. The Company may contribute additional cash or securities to FSEP Funding from time to time and FSEP Funding may
purchase additional securities from various sources. FSEP Funding has appointed the Company to manage its portfolio of securities pursuant to the terms of an investment management agreement. FSEP

the period from June 24, 2011 to June 10, 2016, interest on borrowings under the Deutsche Bank credit facility accrued at a rate equal to LIBOR for an interest
period closest to the weighted average LIBOR interest period of eligible securities owned by FSEP Funding plus 1.80% per annum. Beginning June 11, 2016, interest on borrowings under the

          On November 6, 2015, Foxfields Funding LLC, or Foxfields Funding, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary of the Company, entered into
a senior secured multiple draw term loan facility, or the Fortress facility, with Fortress, the lenders from time to time party thereto and the other loan parties from time to time party thereto. The

Goldman Financing     

          On September 11, 2014, through its two wholly-owned, special-purpose financing subsidiaries, Gladwyne Funding LLC, or Gladwyne
Funding, and Strafford Funding LLC, or Strafford Funding, the Company entered into a debt financing arrangement with Goldman. The amount available under the financing arrangement, as amended,
is $325,000. The Company elected to structure the financing in the manner described more fully below in order to, among other things, obtain such financing at a lower cost than would have been
available through alternate arrangements.   

          Under
the financing arrangement, assets in the Company's portfolio may be sold and/or contributed by it from time to time to Gladwyne Funding, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Sale
and Contribution Agreement, dated as of September 11, 2014, between the Company and Gladwyne Funding, or the Sale and Contribution Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of
assets held by Gladwyne Funding was $802,936, which includes an initial contribution by the Company of a portfolio of assets with an aggregate par value of $427,061. The assets held by Gladwyne
Funding secure the obligations of Gladwyne Funding under certain Floating Rate Notes, or the Notes, to be issued from time to time by Gladwyne Funding to Strafford Funding, pursuant to an indenture,
dated as of September 11, 2014, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 21, 2016, or the Indenture, with Citibank, as trustee. Pursuant to the
Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be issued by Gladwyne Funding from time to time is $577,750. Interest on the Notes under the Indenture accrues at three-month LIBOR plus a
spread of 4.00% per annum. Principal and any unpaid interest on the Notes will be due and payable on the stated maturity date of November 15, 2025. As of September 30, 2016, Strafford
Funding had

(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)    

Note 8. Financing Arrangements (Continued)    

  purchased
$577,750 of Notes, the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be purchased under the Goldman facility (as defined below).   

          Strafford
Funding, in turn, entered into a repurchase transaction with Goldman, pursuant to the terms of a master repurchase agreement and the related annex thereto, each dated as of
September 11, 2014, as supplemented by the second amended and restated master confirmation dated as of September 21, 2016, or collectively, the Goldman facility. Pursuant to the Goldman
facility, on one or more occasions beginning December 15, 2014, Goldman began purchasing Notes held by Strafford Funding for an aggregate purchase price equal to approximately 56.25% of the
principal amount of the Notes purchased. As of September 30, 2016, Goldman had purchased Notes in the principal amount of $577,750 from Strafford Funding, the maximum principal amount of Notes
available to be purchased under the Goldman facility, for a total purchase price equal to $325,000.   

          Strafford
Funding will repurchase the Notes sold to Goldman under the Goldman facility no later than September 15, 2018. The repurchase price paid by Strafford Funding to Goldman
will be equal to the purchase price paid by Goldman for the repurchased Notes, plus financing fees accrued at the applicable pricing rate under the Goldman facility. Through March 15, 2015,
financing fees accrued on the greater of $225,000 or the aggregate purchase price paid by Goldman for such Notes. Thereafter, financing fees accrue on $325,000 (even in prior periods when the
aggregate purchase price paid for Notes purchased by Goldman was less than that amount), unless and until the outstanding amount is reduced in accordance with the terms of the Goldman facility.   

          If
the Goldman facility is accelerated prior to September 15, 2018 due to an event of default or the failure of Gladwyne Funding to commit to sell any underlying assets that
become defaulted obligations within 30 days and thereafter to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell any such defaulted obligations, then Strafford Funding must pay to Goldman a fee equal
to the present value of the
aggregate amount of the financing fees that would have been payable to Goldman through September 15, 2018 had the acceleration not occurred. The financing fee under the Goldman facility is
equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of up to 3.38% per annum for the relevant period.   

          Goldman
may require Strafford Funding to post cash collateral if the market value of the Notes (measured by reference to the market value of Gladwyne Funding's portfolio of assets)
declines and is less than the required margin amount under the Goldman facility. In such event, in order to satisfy any such margin-posting requirements, Strafford Funding has the option to borrow
funds from the Company pursuant to an uncommitted revolving credit agreement, dated as of September 11, 2014, and amended and restated on September 21, 2016, between Strafford Funding,
as borrower, and the Company, as lender, or the Revolving Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may not exceed $325,000 and will accrue interest at a rate equal to
one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.75% per annum.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $577,750 had been purchased by Strafford Funding from Gladwyne Funding and subsequently sold to Goldman under
the Goldman facility for aggregate proceeds of $325,000. The carrying amount outstanding under the Goldman facility approximates its fair value. The Company funded each purchase of Notes by Strafford
Funding through a capital contribution to Strafford Funding. As of September 30, 2016, Strafford Funding's liability under the Goldman facility was $325,000, plus $543 of accrued interest

Natixis Credit Facility     

          On July 11, 2013, Energy Funding LLC, or Energy Funding, the Company's wholly-owned, special-purpose financing subsidiary, entered
into a revolving credit facility, or the Natixis credit facility, with Natixis, New York Branch, or Natixis, as administrative agent and lender, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as collateral
agent and custodian, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. The Natixis credit facility provided for revolving borrowings through January 11, 2015 in an aggregate principal
amount up to $150,000 on a committed basis. After that date, the Company was no longer permitted to borrow under the facility and outstanding amounts began to
amortize. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $40,738 of outstanding borrowings under the facility.   

          The
Company contributed cash and debt securities to Energy Funding from time to time prior to the commencement of the amortization period under the facility, subject to certain
restrictions set forth in the Natixis credit facility. The Company continues to retain a residual interest in any assets contributed through its ownership of Energy Funding or it received fair market
value for any debt securities sold to Energy Funding. Energy Funding was also permitted to purchase additional debt securities from various sources prior to the commencement of the amortization period
under the

Energy Funding has appointed the Company to manage its portfolio of debt securities pursuant to the terms of a collateral management agreement. Energy Funding's obligations to the lenders
under the facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Energy Funding, including its portfolio of debt securities. The obligations of Energy Funding
under the facility are non-recourse to the Company and the Company's exposure under the facility is limited to the value of the Company's investment in Energy Funding.   

          Borrowings
under the Natixis credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to the applicable commercial paper rate plus 2.25% per annum. Prior to the commencement of the amortization
period, Energy Funding was subject to a non-usage fee of 1.00% per annum to the extent that the aggregate principal amount available under the Natixis credit facility had not been borrowed. Any
amounts borrowed under the facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on July 11, 2023.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $51,435 and $92,173, respectively, was outstanding under the Natixis credit facility. The carrying amount outstanding under
the facility approximates its fair value. The Company incurred costs of $2,544 in connection with obtaining the facility, which the Company has recorded as deferred financing costs on its consolidated
balance sheets and amortizes to interest expense over the life of the facility. As of September 30, 2016, $605 of such deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized to interest expense.

  facility,
with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as administrative agent, each of the conduit lenders and institutional lenders from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, collectively referred to herein as Wells Fargo, as the collateral agent, account bank and collateral custodian under the Wells Fargo credit facility. The Wells Fargo credit facility
originally provided for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount up to $200,000 on a committed basis, subject to Wayne Funding's option to reduce the commitment amount as provided in the Wells
Fargo credit facility. Wayne Funding elected to reduce the commitment amount on February 23, 2016 to $125,000. On October 13, 2016, the Wells Fargo credit facility was further amended to
(1) reduce the maximum commitment from $125,000 to $60,000; (2) shorten the maturity date from September 9, 2019 to September 9, 2018; and (3) eliminate the
non-usage fee.   

          The
Company may contribute cash, loans or bonds to Wayne Funding from time to time and will retain a residual interest in any assets contributed through its ownership of Wayne Funding or
will receive fair market value for any assets sold to Wayne Funding. Wayne Funding may purchase additional assets from various sources. Wayne Funding has appointed the Company to manage its portfolio
of assets pursuant to the terms of a collateral management agreement. Wayne Funding's obligations to Wells Fargo under the Wells Fargo credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest
in substantially all of the assets of Wayne Funding, including its portfolio of assets. The obligations of Wayne Funding under the Wells Fargo credit facility are non-recourse to the Company and the
Company's exposure under the facility is limited to the value of its investment in Wayne Funding.   

          Borrowings
under the Wells Fargo credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging between 2.50% and 2.75% per annum, depending on the
composition of the portfolio of assets for the relevant period. During the period beginning October 10, 2014 through June 5, 2015, Wayne Funding was subject to a non-usage fee of 0.50%
per annum on the unborrowed principal amount available under the Wells Fargo credit facility. Beginning June 6, 2015 and through October 12, 2016, the non-usage fee was equal to the sum
of (a) 0.50% per annum on the first $40,000 of unborrowed principal amount available under the Wells Fargo credit facility and (b) 2.00% on any unborrowed principal amount available
under the facility in excess of $40,000. Any amounts borrowed under the Wells Fargo credit facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on
September 9, 2018. Borrowings under the Wells Fargo credit facility are subject to compliance with a borrowing base, pursuant to which the amount of funds advanced to Wayne Funding varies
depending upon the types of assets in Wayne Funding's portfolio.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $85,100 and $140,000, respectively, was outstanding under the Wells Fargo credit facility. The carrying amount outstanding
under the facility approximates its fair value. The Company incurred costs of $2,641 in connection with obtaining the facility, which the Company has recorded as deferred financing costs on its
consolidated balance sheets and amortizes to interest expense over the life of the facility. As of September 30, 2016, $1,554 of such deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized to
interest expense.

Note 10. Financial Highlights     

The following is a schedule of financial highlights of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015:   

(1)    Per
share data may be rounded in order to recompute the ending net asset value per share.
      (2)    The
per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the applicable period.
      (3)    The
per share data for distributions reflects the actual amount of distributions paid per share during the applicable period.
      (4)    The
issuance of common shares on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of common shares in the Company's
continuous public offering and pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan. The issuance of common shares at an offering price, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is
greater than the net asset value per share results in an increase in net asset value per share. The per share impact of the Company's issuance of common shares was an increase in net asset value of
less than $0.01 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
      (5)    The
per share impact of the Company's repurchases of common shares was a reduction to net asset value of less than $0.01 per share during each period.

(6)    The
total return for each period presented was calculated based on the change in net asset value during the applicable period, including the impact of distributions
reinvested in accordance with the Company's distribution reinvestment plan. The total return does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with
the sale of the Company's common shares. The total return includes the effect of the issuance of common shares at a net offering price that is greater than net asset value per share, which causes an
increase in net asset value per share. The historical calculation of total return in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company's future total return, which may be greater or
less than the return shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company's ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates
payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company's expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to
which the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of
performance in future periods. The total return calculations set forth above represent the total return on the Company's investment portfolio during the applicable period and do not represent an
actual return to shareholders. The total return for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unaudited.
      (7)    The
total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) for each period presented was calculated by taking the net asset value per share as of the end of
the applicable period, adding the cash distributions per share which were declared during the applicable period and dividing the total by the net asset value per share at the beginning of the
applicable period. The total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale
of the Company's common shares. The total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) includes the effect of the issuance of common shares at a net offering price that is greater than net
asset value per share, which causes an increase in net asset value per share. The historical calculation of total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) in the table should not be
considered a representation of the Company's future total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions), which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a number of
factors, including the Company's ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the
level of the Company's expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets and
general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. The total return calculations
set forth above represent the total return on the Company's investment portfolio during the applicable period and do not represent an actual return to shareholders.
      (8)    Weighted
average net assets during the applicable period are used for this calculation. Ratios for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
annualized. The following is a schedule of supplemental ratios for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015:    

(9)    Portfolio
turnover for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is not annualized.
      (10)    Asset
coverage per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of the Company's total consolidated assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior
securities, to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness.

Overview     

          We were formed as a Delaware statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on September 16, 2010 and formally commenced
investment operations on July 18, 2011 upon raising gross proceeds in excess of $2,500 from sales of our common shares in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with
us or FS Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no
operations except for matters relating to our organization.   

          Our
investment activities are managed by FS Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under our investment advisory and administrative services
agreement, we have agreed to pay FS Advisor an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as incentive fees based on our performance. FS Advisor has engaged GSO to act as our
investment sub-adviser. GSO assists FS Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FS Advisor according to guidelines set by FS Advisor.   

          Our
investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at
least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.   

Our
investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe
will allow us to generate an attractive total return with an acceptable level of risk.   

            Direct Originations   :    We intend to leverage our relationship with GSO and its global sourcing and origination platform, including its
industry
relationships, to directly source investment opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments
may include both debt and equity components, although we do not expect to make equity investments (other than income-oriented equity investments) independent of having an existing credit relationship.
We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.   

            Opportunistic   :    We seek to capitalize on market price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities where the market
price of such
investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to, among other things, general dislocations in the
markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an Energy industry sub-sector being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these
securities that have been misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include both
event driven investments and anchor orders.   

          In
the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that arise in the markets due to an impending event and where the market's apparent expectation of
value differs substantially from our fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or
legal ruling, or a material contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company's financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing
depends more heavily on our   

  55  

Table of Contents   

  ability
to successfully predict the outcome of an individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial
diversification benefits and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.   

We
may also invest in certain opportunities that are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank but where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the
average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees, preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return for our
significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity with a particular company, Energy
industry sub-sector or financial sponsor, and the broader investment experiences of FS Advisor and GSO.   

Broadly Syndicated/Other   :    Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions and opportunistic investments, in
certain
circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and
provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able
to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.   

Our
portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy
companies within the United States. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior and subordinated debt. In addition to investments purchased from dealers or other investors in the secondary
market, we expect to invest in primary market transactions and directly originated investments as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's
needs with our investment objectives. Our
portfolio may also be comprised of select income-oriented preferred or common equity interests, which refers to equity interests that pay consistent, high-yielding dividends, that we believe will
produce both current income and long-term capital appreciation. These income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships. In connection with
certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in
connection with a restructuring.   

Revenues     

          The principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net
investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net change in
unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses.
Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or
loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency
fluctuations. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on
foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations.   

          We
principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity
or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial
assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized as earned.

Expenses     

          Our primary operating expenses include the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services
agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other expenses necessary for our operations. Our investment advisory fee compensates FS Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating,
negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. FS Advisor is responsible for compensating our investment sub-adviser.   

          We
reimburse FS Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related
expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS Advisor. Such services include the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting,
legal services, investor relations and other administrative services. FS Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which
includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS Advisor assists us in
calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our
expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. See " Related Party Transactions" for additional information regarding the reimbursements
payable to FS Advisor for administrative services and the methodology for determining the amount of any such reimbursements. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions. For
additional information regarding these expenses, please see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

          In
addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information
for review by FS Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with
respect to RIC compliance.   

Expense Reimbursement     

          Pursuant to an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement, amended and restated as of May 16, 2013, or the expense
reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse us for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders will be paid from our
offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments we may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other distributions to us that are
treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of our distributions to shareholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent that we may use such
dividends or other distribution proceeds to fund our distributions to shareholders. Under those circumstances, FS Investments will not reimburse us for the portion of such distributions to
shareholders that represent a return of capital for tax purposes, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to shareholders.   

Under
the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments will reimburse us quarterly for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between our cumulative distributions paid to our
shareholders in each quarter, less the sum of our net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity
investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in each quarter.   

          Pursuant
to the expense reimbursement agreement, we have a conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by FS Investments under such agreement if (and only
to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of our net investment company taxable income, net capital
gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not included in net investment
company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the distributions paid by us to our shareholders; provided, however, that (i) we will only reimburse FS Investments for expense support
payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter beginning on or after July 1, 2013 to the extent that   

  57  

Table of Contents   

  the
payment of such reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause "other operating expenses" (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of
any expense support payments received by us during such fiscal year) to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of our average net assets attributable to our common shares for the fiscal year-to-date
period after taking such payments into account and (B) the percentage of our average net assets attributable to our common shares represented by "other operating expenses" during the fiscal
year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support
payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year) and (ii) we will not reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments if the aggregate amount of
distributions per share declared by us in such calendar quarter is less than the aggregate amount of distributions per share declared by us in the calendar quarter in which FS Investments made the
expense support payment to which such reimbursement relates. We are not obligated to pay interest on the payments we receive from FS Investments. "Other operating expenses" means our total "operating
expenses" (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, organization and offering expenses, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary
expenses. "Operating expenses" means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with GAAP for investment companies.   

          We
or FS Investments may terminate the expense reimbursement agreement at any time. The specific amount of expenses reimbursed by FS Investments, if any, will be determined at the end of
each quarter. Upon termination of the expense reimbursement agreement by FS Investments, FS Investments will be required to fund any amounts accrued thereunder as of the date of termination.
Similarly, our conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the expense reimbursement agreement shall survive the termination of such agreement by either party.   

FS
Investments is controlled by our chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, and our vice-chairman, David J. Adelman. There can be no assurance that the
expense reimbursement agreement will remain in effect or that FS Investments will reimburse any portion of our expenses in future quarters.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, we had no reimbursements due from FS Investments and no further amounts remained subject to repayment by us to FS Investments in the future.   

Portfolio Investment Activity for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and for the
Year Ended December 31, 2015     

          During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $988,597. During the same period, we
sold investments for proceeds of $361,229 and received principal repayments of $374,270. As of September 30, 2016, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $3,747,676 (24% in first
lien senior secured loans, 24% in second lien senior secured loans, 10% in senior secured bonds, 26% in subordinated debt and 16% in equity/other), consisted of interests in 86 portfolio companies.
The portfolio companies that comprised our portfolio as of such date had an average annual EBITDA of approximately $317.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, the debt investments in our
portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 97.2% of par value, and our estimated gross annual portfolio yield, prior to leverage (which represents the expected annualized yield to be
generated by us on our investment portfolio based on the composition of our portfolio as of such date), was 8.6% based upon the amortized cost of our investments.   

          Based
on our regular weekly cash distribution rate of $0.013625 per share as of September 30, 2016 and our public offering price of $8.25 per share as of such date, the annualized
distribution rate to shareholders as of September 30, 2016 was 8.59%. The distribution rate to shareholders may include income, realized capital gains and a return of investors' capital.   

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $1,195,947. During the same period, we sold investments for proceeds of $590,726 and
received principal repayments of $209,808. As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $3,069,498 (30% in first lien senior secured loans, 30% in second lien
senior secured loans, 11% in senior secured bonds, 19% in subordinated debt and 10% in equity/other), consisted of interests in 90 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that comprised our
portfolio as of such   

  58  

Table of Contents   

  date
had an average annual EBITDA of approximately $244.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the investments in our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 98.4% of par
value and our estimated gross annual portfolio yield, prior to leverage, was 9.3% based upon the amortized cost of our investments.   

          Based
on our regular weekly cash distribution rate of $0.013625 per share as of December 31, 2015 and our public offering price of $7.50 per share as of such date, the annualized
distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2015 was 9.45%. The distribution rate to shareholders may include income, realized capital gains and a return of investors' capital.   

          Our
estimated gross portfolio yield and annualized distribution rate to shareholders do not represent actual investment returns to shareholders. Our gross annual portfolio yield and
distribution rate to shareholders are subject to change and in the future may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See the sections entitled "Risk Factors" in our annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and in our other periodic reports filed with the SEC for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with
these statements.

As
of September 30, 2016, except for FourPoint Energy, LLC, in which we held a senior secured bond and four equity/other investments, Sunnova Energy Corp., in which we held
two equity/other investments, Sunnova Asset Portfolio 5 Holdings, LLC, in which we held a first lien senior secured loan, Titan Energy Operating, LLC, in which we held a second lien
senior secured loan and an equity/other investment, and Lusk Operating LLC, in which we held a first lien senior secured loan and an equity/other investment, we were not an "affiliated person"
of any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, except for Lusk Operating LLC, in which we held a first lien senior secured loan and an
equity/other investment, we did not "control" any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act.   

          As
of December 31, 2015, except for FourPoint Energy, LLC, in which we held a senior secured bond and two equity/other investments, Sunnova Holdings, LLC, in which
we held one equity/other
investment and its wholly-owned subsidiary Sunnova Asset Portfolio 5 Holdings, LLC, in which we held one first lien senior secured loan, we were not an "affiliated person" of any of our
portfolio companies,   

  61  

Table of Contents   

  as
defined in the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2015, except for Sunnova Holdings, LLC, in which we held one equity/other investment and its wholly-owned subsidiary Sunnova Asset
Portfolio 5 Holdings, LLC, in which we held one first lien senior secured loan, we did not "control" any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act.   

          In
general, under the 1940 Act, we would be presumed to "control" a portfolio company if we owned more than 25% of its voting securities or we had the power to exercise control over the
management or policies of a portfolio company, and would be an "affiliated person" of a portfolio company if we owned 5% or more of its voting securities.   

          Our
investment portfolio may contain loans or bonds that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, or other investments, which may require us to provide funding
when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we had two senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded
commitments of $13,696 and three equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $8,924. As of September 30, 2016, these unfunded equity/other investments were BL Sand Hills
Unit, L.P., net profits interest, BL Sand Hills Unit, L.P., overriding royalty interest and Synergy Offshore LLC. As of December 31, 2015, we had four senior secured loan
investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $67,365, one senior secured bond investment with an unfunded commitment of $18,470 and five equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded
commitments of $33,890. As of December 31, 2015, these unfunded equity/other investments were Altus Power America Holdings, LLC, BL Sand Hills Unit, L.P., net profits interest, BL
Sand Hills Unit, L.P., overriding royalty interest, Sunnova Holdings, LLC and Synergy Offshore LLC. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities
to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.   

Portfolio Asset Quality     

          In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FS Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the
expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FS Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment
rating:   

Investment Rating    
     
   Summary Description    

1  
     
  Investment exceeding expectations and/or capital gain expected.  

2  
     
      Performing investment generally executing in accordance with the portfolio company's business plan full return of principal and
interest expected.  

3  
     
      Performing investment requiring closer monitoring.  

4  
     
      Underperforming investment some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment.  

5  
     
      Underperforming investment with expected loss of interest and some principal.  

The
following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

62  

Table of Contents   

          The
amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new
investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values. As of
September 30, 2016, 37% of our portfolio consisted of investments with an investment rating of three, 1% of our portfolio consisted of investments with an investment rating of four and 4% of
our portfolio consisted of investments with an investment rating of five, in each case, based on fair value.   

Results of Operations     

          After briefly rising above $52 per barrel in June, oil prices remained largely range-bound between $40 per barrel and $50 per barrel through
August and September 2016, generally helping energy high yield bonds and energy senior secured loans to build on the momentum sustained through the second quarter. The "spread-to-worst" of the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch High Yield Energy Index, or the Energy Index, which measures the difference from the Energy Index's worst performing security to Treasuries, tightened over the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 from 834 basis points as of June 30, 2016 to 643 basis points as of September 30, 2016. Overall, the Energy Index ended the third quarter of 2016 with a
yield-to-worst of 7.67% after reaching levels earlier in the year not seen since November 2008.   

          West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices, which began the year at $36.76 per barrel, reached an eleven month high on June 8, 2016 and ended at $48.24 per barrel as of
September 30, 2016. The average par weighted price of the Energy Index began the year at $64.89, reached a year-to-date low of $52.17 on February 11, 2016 and significantly rebounded to
$92.53 as of September 30, 2016. Rising asset prices resulted in unrealized appreciation on investments during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Since September 30, 2016,
OPEC's agreement in principle to cut production continued to push oil prices higher, though details of the arrangement were largely left to its next meeting in late November 2016.   

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Revenues     

          We generated investment income of $89,382 and $98,758 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the form
of interest and fees earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien), senior secured bonds and subordinated debt investments in our portfolio. Such revenues represent $75,249 and $90,073 of
cash income earned as well as $14,133 and $8,685 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount, PIK interest and accrual of limited partnership income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.   

          The
level of investment income we receive is directly related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the
dollar amount
of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase to the extent the size of our investment portfolio increases and as the proportion of directly originated investments in our portfolio
increases.   

          During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $2,624 and $10,777 of fee income, which represented 2.9% and 10.9%, respectively, of total investment
income. Such fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee
income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. The decrease in fee income during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the prepayment of several large investments during the three months ended
September 30, 2015.   

Expenses     

          Our total expenses were $33,651 and $40,122 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our expenses include
base management fees attributed to FS Advisor of $20,086 and   

  63  

Table of Contents   

  $19,522
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our expenses also include administrative services expenses attributed to FS Advisor of $1,118 and $892 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

FS
Advisor is eligible to receive incentive fees based on our performance. We did not accrue any subordinated incentive fee on income during the three months ended September 30,
2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $9,611. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not
accrue any capital gains incentive fees. See " Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee" and " Critical Accounting Policies Subordinated
Income Incentive Fee" for additional information about how the incentive fees are calculated.   

          We
recorded interest expense of $8,921 and $7,627 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our financing arrangements. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, fees and expenses incurred with our fund administrator, which provides various accounting and administrative services to us, totaled $384 and
$361, respectively, and fees and expenses incurred with our share transfer agent totaled $750 and $767, respectively. Fees for our board of trustees were $245 and $246 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of our deferred offering costs was $755 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Our
other general and administrative expenses totaled $1,370 and $1,020 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of the following:   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ratio of our total expenses to our average net assets was 1.10% and 1.42%, respectively. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our ratio of total expenses to average net assets included $8,921 and $7,627, respectively, related to interest expense, $0 and $9,611, respectively, related
to accruals for incentive fees, $755 and $0, respectively, related to amortization of deferred offering costs and $22 and $76, respectively, related to accruals for income taxes. Without such
expenses, our ratio of expenses to average net assets would have been 0.78% and 0.81% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Incentive fees and interest expense,
among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR, among other
factors.   

Net Investment Income     

          Our net investment income totaled $55,731 ($0.13 per share) and $58,636 ($0.17 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net investment income on a per share basis can be attributed primarily to a decrease in fee income, a decrease in investment income resulting from the
restructuring of certain investments in the portfolio, an increase in the percentage of non-income producing equity securities held in the portfolio and an increase in the percentage of income
producing assets on non-accrual held in the portfolio.   

Net Realized Gains or Losses     

          We sold investments and received principal repayments of $10,159 and $250,161, respectively, during the three months ended September 30,
2016, from which we realized a net loss of $119,886. We sold investments and received principal repayments of $155,343 and $87,424, respectively, during the   

  64  

Table of Contents   

  three
months ended September 30, 2015, from which we realized a net loss of $100,813. We realized a net loss of $63 from settlements on foreign currency during the three months ended
September 30, 2015.   

Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on
Foreign Currency     

          For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled
$210,483 and $(239,783), respectively, and the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency was $(2) and $59, respectively. The change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our
investments during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily driven by a general improvement in the energy markets, a tightening of credit spreads and the performance of our
anchor order and broadly syndicated investments. The change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by
increased volatility and a general widening of credit spreads in the Energy high yield and leveraged loan markets and by the performance of our directly originated and opportunistic investments.   

Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations     

          For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $146,326
($0.35 per share) and $(281,964) ($(0.81) per share), respectively.   

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Revenues     

          We generated investment income of $275,618 and $276,755 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the form
of interest and fees earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien), senior secured bonds and subordinated debt investments in our portfolio. Such revenues represent $242,463 and $252,509 of
cash income earned as well as $33,155 and $24,246 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount, PIK interest and accrual of limited partnership income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.

level of investment income we receive is directly related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the
dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase to the extent the size of our investment portfolio increases and as the proportion of directly originated investments in
our portfolio increases.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $12,607 and $24,422 of fee income, which represented 4.6% and 8.8%, respectively, of total investment
income. Such fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee
income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. The decrease in fee income during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the prepayment of several large investments during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.   

Expenses     

          Our total expenses were $100,471 and $109,730 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our expenses include
base management fees attributed to FS Advisor of $55,725 and $57,659 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our expenses also include administrative services
expenses attributed to FS Advisor of $2,885 and $3,153 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

FS
Advisor is eligible to receive incentive fees based on our performance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on
income of $5,774 and   

  65  

Table of Contents   

  $18,968,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not accrue any capital gains incentive fees. See " Critical Accounting
Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee" and " Critical Accounting Policies Subordinated Income Incentive Fee" for additional information about how the incentive fees
are calculated.   

          We
recorded interest expense of $27,200 and $22,351 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our financing arrangements. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, fees and expenses incurred with our fund administrator, which provides various accounting and administrative services to us, totaled $994 and
$1,082, respectively, and fees and expenses incurred with our share transfer agent totaled $2,134 and $2,199, respectively. Fees for our board of trustees were $757 and $736 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of our deferred offering costs was $1,378 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

          Our
other general and administrative expenses totaled $3,523 and $3,348 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of the following:   

(1)    On
April 1, 2015, James F. Volk was appointed as our chief compliance officer. Prior to that date, we had contracted with Vigilant Compliance, LLC to
provide the services of Salvatore Faia as our chief compliance officer. Mr. Volk is employed by FS Investments and will not receive any direct compensation from us in this capacity.    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ratio of our total expenses to our average net assets was 3.74% and 3.96%, respectively. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, our ratio of total expenses to average net assets included $27,200 and $22,351, respectively, related to interest expense, $5,774 and $18,968, respectively, related
to accruals for incentive fees, $1,378 and $0, respectively, related to amortization of deferred offering costs and $101 and $234, respectively, related to accruals for income taxes. Without such
expenses, our ratio of expenses to average net assets would have been 2.46% and 2.46% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Incentive fees and interest expense,
among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR, among other
factors.   

Net Investment Income     

          Our net investment income totaled $175,147 ($0.44 per share) and $167,025 ($0.51 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net investment income on a per share basis can be attributed primarily to a decrease in fee income, a decrease in investment income resulting from the
restructuring of certain investments in the portfolio, an increase in the percentage of non-income producing equity securities held in the portfolio and an increase in the percentage of income
producing assets on non-accrual held in the portfolio.   

Net Realized Gains or Losses     

          We sold investments and received principal repayments of $361,229 and $374,270, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30,
2016, from which we realized a net loss of $195,964. We sold investments and received principal repayments of $442,341 and $180,506, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30,
2015, from which we realized a net loss of $159,323. We realized a   

  66  

Table of Contents   

  net
loss of $210 from settlements on foreign currency during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on
Foreign Currency     

          For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled
$585,216 and $(171,393), respectively, and the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency was $12 and $(82), respectively. The change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our
investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily driven by a general improvement in the energy markets, a tightening of credit spreads and the performance of our
directly originated and anchor order investments. The change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by
a general widening of credit spreads in Energy markets and by the performance of our directly originated and opportunistic investments.   

Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations     

          For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $564,411
($1.41 per share) and $(163,983) ($(0.50) per share), respectively.   

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources     

          Based on and subject to market conditions and the pace of capital raising, we expect to close our public offering to new investors in mid to
late November 2016. Improving energy market conditions since the middle of February 2016 through September 30, 2016, have led to positive developments in the portfolio and a subsequent increase
in our net asset value per common share. However, certain investments in the portfolio were restructured or experienced defaults due to the recently depressed prices of oil and natural gas, and we may
experience additional restructurings or defaults in the future. These restructurings and defaults may have an impact on the level of income received by us. As a result, we are evaluating the current
distribution rate payable on our common shares and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a weekly cash distribution amount of $0.013625 per common share (or the quarterly
equivalent thereto following the closing of our public offering). FS Advisor will waive its incentive fees and may waive a portion of its management fee through the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure
that no portion of our distributions to shareholders is paid from offering proceeds or borrowings.   

Overview     

          As of September 30, 2016, we had $271,317 in cash, which we or our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and
$506,563 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and
at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event may leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See " Financing Arrangements." As of
September 30, 2016, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2016, we had two
senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $13,696 and three equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $8,924. We maintain sufficient cash on hand,
available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 65,945,030 common shares for gross proceeds of $476,714 at an average price per share of $7.23. The gross proceeds
received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include reinvested shareholder distributions of $132,928, for which we issued 19,503,968 common shares. The sales commissions and dealer
manager fees related to the sale of our common shares were $30,047 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These sales commissions and fees include $5,822 retained by the dealer manager,
FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates.

Table of Contents    

          Since commencing our continuous public offering and through October 25, 2016, we sold 444,115,900 common shares (as adjusted for share distributions) for
gross proceeds of $4,319,069, including common shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan. As of October 25, 2016, we have raised total gross proceeds of $4,339,273, including $200
of seed capital contributed by the principals of FS Advisor in December 2010 and $20,004 in proceeds raised from the principals of FS Advisor, other individuals and entities affiliated with FS
Advisor, certain members of our board of trustees and certain individuals and entities affiliated with GSO in a private placement conducted in April 2011.   

          We
generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous public offering and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal
repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We are engaged in a continuous public offering of our common shares. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue common shares at
weekly closings. Shares are issued at prices that, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, must be above our net asset value per share.   

          Prior
to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from our continuous public offering and from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in
cash, cash equivalents,
U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be
taxed as a RIC.   

          To
provide our shareholders with limited liquidity, we conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to our share repurchase program. The first such tender offer commenced in August 2012, and
the repurchase occurred in connection with our October 1, 2012 semi-monthly closing.   

          On
October 13, 2016, we amended the terms of our share repurchase program, or the amended share repurchase program, which will first be effective for our quarterly repurchase
offer for the fourth quarter of 2016. Prior to the amendment of the share repurchase program, we offered to repurchase common shares at a price equal to 90% of the offering price in effect on the date
of repurchase. Under the amended share repurchase program, we intend to offer to repurchase common shares at a price equal to the price at which common shares are issued pursuant to our distribution
reinvestment plan on the distribution date coinciding with the applicable share repurchase date. The price at which common shares are issued under our distribution reinvestment plan is determined by
our board of trustees or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, and will be (i) not less than the net asset value per common share as determined in good faith by our board of trustees or
a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, immediately prior to the payment date of the distribution and (ii) not more than 2.5% greater than the net asset value per common share as of such
date.   

          The
following table provides information concerning our repurchases of common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015:   

On
October 5, 2016, we repurchased 2,983,921 common shares (representing 100% of common shares tendered for repurchase and 0.69% of the shares outstanding as of such date) at
$7.425 per share for aggregate consideration totaling $22,156.

      (3)    As
described in Note 8, borrowings under the Fortress facility accrue interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.00%, subject to a floor of 0.75%.
      (4)    Before
September 21, 2016, borrowings under the Goldman facility accrued interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum. Beginning on
September 21, 2016, borrowings under the Goldman facility accrue interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.38% per annum.
      (5)    On

additional information regarding our outstanding financing arrangements, see Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein.   

RIC Tax Treatment and Distributions     

          We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the
Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay
corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among
other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year,
dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our "investment company taxable income," which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net
short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual
Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the "spillover dividend" provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we
distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions
to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely
manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year,
(2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of
that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of
the   

  69  

Table of Contents   

  following
calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.
We generally will endeavor in each tax year to avoid any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings.   

We
authorize and declare ordinary cash distributions on a weekly basis, while continuing to pay such distributions on a monthly basis, in each case subject to our board of trustees'
discretion and applicable legal restrictions. Following the closing of our public offering, we will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and
declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept such shareholder's subscription for our common shares. From time to time, we may also pay special
interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees.   

          During
certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from our continuous public offering of
common shares. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather
than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including
any fees payable to FS Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported
capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the
distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.   

          The
following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared and paid on our common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

We
have adopted an "opt in" distribution reinvestment plan for our shareholders. As a result, if we make a cash distribution, our shareholders will receive distributions in cash unless
they specifically "opt in" to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional common shares. However, certain state authorities or regulators may
impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a shareholder's ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. Although distributions paid in the form of additional
common shares will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, shareholders who elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan
will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. Shareholders receiving distributions in the form of
additional common shares will generally be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of the fair market value of our common shares.   

          In
connection with the anticipated closing of our public offering, we have further amended and restated our distribution reinvestment plan, or the amended distribution reinvestment plan,
which will first apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions paid on or after November 30, 2016. Prior to the amendment to the distribution reinvestment plan, we authorized and declared
ordinary cash distributions on a weekly basis and paid such distributions on a monthly basis. On October 3, 2016 and October 26, 2016 our board of trustees declared regular weekly cash
distributions for October 2016 and November 2016, respectively. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to shareholders of record as of weekly record dates previously determined by our
board of trustees in the amount of $0.013625 per share. Following the closing of our public offering, we intend to declare regular cash   

  70  

Table of Contents   

  distributions
on a quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the
sole discretion of our board of trustees.   

          We
may fund our cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds legally available to us, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations,
capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in
portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from FS Investments. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.   

          For
a period of time following commencement of our continuous public offering, substantial portions of our distributions were funded through the reimbursement of certain expenses by FS
Investments and its affiliates, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees by FS Advisor, that were subject to repayment by us within three years. The purpose of this arrangement
was to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders was paid from offering proceeds or borrowings. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory
fees were not based on our investment performance.   

          No
portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 was funded through the reimbursement of operating expenses by FS Investments. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not repay any amounts to FS Investments for expenses previously reimbursed or waived. There can be no assurance that we will continue
to achieve the performance necessary to sustain our distributions or that we will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all. FS Investments and its affiliates have no obligation to
waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods.   

          The
following table reflects the sources of the cash distributions on a tax basis that we paid on our common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

(1)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 81.5% and 89.9%, respectively, of the Company's gross investment income on a tax basis was
attributable to cash income earned and 5.0% and 0.1%, respectively, was attributable to non-cash income earned. In addition, 10.6% and 8.2%, respectively, was attributed to paid-in-kind, or PIK,
interest and 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively, was attributed to accretion of discount during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     

Our
net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $198,465 and $164,105, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, we had $1,972 and $15,496, respectively, of undistributed ordinary income on a tax basis and distributable income received from a limited partnership interest. During the
last twelve months, our distributions exceeded tax-basis net investment income by $7,558. In addition, $15,728 of our tax-basis net investment income was generated by fee income, which is generally
non-recurring in nature and the full amount of which is recorded as revenue when earned. Excluding fee income from net investment income during the last twelve months, we would have had distributions
in excess of tax-basis net   

  71  

Table of Contents   

  investment
income of $23,286. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 was funded from offering proceeds or borrowings.   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we saw positive developments in our investment portfolio and a subsequent increase in our net asset value. However, certain
investments in the portfolio were restructured or experienced defaults due to the recently depressed prices of oil and natural gas, and we may experience additional restructurings or defaults in the
future. These restructurings and defaults may have an impact on the level of income received by us. As a result, we are evaluating the current distribution rate payable on our common shares and there
can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a weekly cash distribution amount of $0.013625 per common share (or the quarterly equivalent thereto following the closing of our public offering).
FS Advisor will waive its incentive fees and may waive a portion of its management fee through the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders is paid from
offering proceeds or borrowings.   

          See
Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis
net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

Critical Accounting Policies     

          Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that
require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that
may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our
past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we
execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.   

Valuation of Portfolio Investments     

          We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by
our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited
to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.   

          Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure   , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB
clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to
initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1,
defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for
identical securities   

  72  

Table of Contents   

  where
there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.   

          With
respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described

our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS Advisor's management team reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each
portfolio company or investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;   
            FS Advisor's management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;    
            preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;   
            the valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS Advisor's management team, together with our independent third-party
valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;   
            following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and    
            our board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on
various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.    

Determination
of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the
possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved
independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may
use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in
determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees
may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.   

          Valuation
of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility
in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted
cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation
to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.   

          For
convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the
security into which the debt may
convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.   

          Our
equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider
various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon
the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition,
recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.

          FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition
statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair
value. FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific
strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to
comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS Advisor's management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable,
may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing
public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.   

          When
we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be
allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity
securities received at their fair value.   

          The
fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at
fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our
valuation policy to FS Advisor's management team, and has authorized FS Advisor's management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board
of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.   

          Our
investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Seventeen senior secured loan investments, two senior
secured bond investments and six subordinated debt investments were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the
borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the debt. Twenty-nine of our
equity/other investments were valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such
investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. One equity/other investment, which
was traded on an active public market, was valued at its closing price as of September 30, 2016. Except as described above, we valued our other investments, including two of our equity/other
investments, by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent third-party pricing service and
screened for validity by such service.   

          Our
investments as of December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Twenty senior secured loan investments, two senior
secured bond investments and five subordinated debt investments were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the
borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the debt. All of our equity/other
investments were valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as
well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Except as described above, we valued our other
investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent third-party pricing service and
screened for validity by such service.   

  74  

Table of Contents   

          We
periodically benchmark the bid and ask prices we receive from third-party pricing services and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our
investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of our management in purchasing and selling these investments, we believe that these prices are reliable indicators of
fair value. However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), we believe that these valuation inputs are classified as Level 3
within the fair value hierarchy. We may also use other methods, including the use of independent valuation firms, to determine fair value for securities for which we cannot obtain prevailing bid and
ask prices through third-party pricing
services or independent dealers or where our board of trustees otherwise determines that the use of such other method is appropriate. We periodically benchmark the valuations provided by the
independent valuation firms against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments. Our valuation committee and board of trustees reviewed and approved the valuation determinations
made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with our valuation policy.   

Revenue Recognition     

          Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect
such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such
income. Our policy is to place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing
it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the
underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will
receive any previously accrued interest, then the previously recognized interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to
principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become current and
are likely to remain current based on our judgment.   

          Loan
origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon
the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded
as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we receive such amounts.   

Net Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in
Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency     

          Gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by
the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but
considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously
recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized and the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for any foreign denominated investments we may hold. Net change in
unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of foreign currency held, receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations.   

Capital Gains Incentive Fee     

          Pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and
payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a
cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the   

  75  

Table of Contents   

  applicable
period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive
fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.   

          While
the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with FS Advisor neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital
gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an AICPA Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee
expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to FS Advisor as if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of
the balance sheet date even though FS Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.   

Subordinated Income Incentive Fee     

          Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FS Advisor may also be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive
fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of our "pre-incentive fee net investment income" for the immediately
preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital equal to 1.625% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 6.5%. As a result, FS Advisor does not
earn this incentive fee for any quarter until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.625%. For purposes of this fee, "adjusted capital" means
cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of our common shares (including proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for distributions from non-liquidating dispositions of our
investments paid to shareholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program. Once our pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle
rate, FS Advisor is entitled to a "catch-up" fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until
our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.031%, or 8.125% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FS Advisor is entitled to receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net
investment income.   

Uncertainty in Income Taxes     

          We evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for
uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a
tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is "more likely than not" to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize
interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, we did not incur any interest or penalties.   

Contractual Obligations     

          We have entered into an agreement with FS Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment
advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average value of our gross assets and
(b) an incentive fee based on our performance. FS Advisor, and to the extent it provides such services, GSO, are reimbursed for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein and " Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager" for a discussion
of these agreements and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Related Party Transactions     

Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager     

          Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FS Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of
the average value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Pursuant to the investment sub-advisory agreement, GSO will receive 50% of all management and incentive fees
payable to FS Advisor under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with respect to each year. We commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative
services agreement on July 18, 2011, upon commencement of our investment operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears.   

The
dealer manager for our continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates. Under the dealer manager agreement among us, FS Advisor and FS
Investment Solutions, FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive sales commissions and dealer manager fees in   

  77  

Table of Contents   

  connection
with the sale of common shares in our continuous public offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives.   

The
following table describes the fees and expenses accrued under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and the dealer manager agreement during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

(1)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $53,977 and $56,049, respectively, in base management fees were paid to FS Advisor. As of
September 30, 2016, $20,086 in base management fees were payable to FS Advisor.
      (2)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $17,822 and $21,499, respectively, of subordinated incentive fees on income were paid to FS Advisor.
As of September 30, 2016, we did not have a subordinated incentive fee on income payable to FS Advisor.
      (3)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $2,784 and $2,940, respectively, of the accrued administrative services expenses related to the
allocation of costs of administrative personnel for services rendered to us by FS Advisor and the remainder related to other reimbursable expenses. We paid $3,201 and $2,979 in administrative services
expenses to FS Advisor during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
      (4)    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred offering costs of $3,600 and $7,150, respectively, of which $3,320 and $3,873,
respectively, related to reimbursements to FS Advisor for offering costs incurred on our behalf, including marketing expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FS Advisor's personnel and
employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing our common shares. See Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion
regarding our change in accounting treatment of offering costs.

Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our related party transactions and relationships, including a
description of the fees and amounts due to FS Advisor, capital contributions by FS Advisor and GSO, potential conflicts of interest, our exemptive relief order, our expense reimbursement arrangement
with FS Investments and FS Benefit Trust's purchases of our common shares.   

Recent Developments     

          During the period from October 1, 2016 to October 25, 2016, we sold 1,968,410 common shares for gross proceeds of $16,037 at an
average price per share of $8.15.    

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.            

          We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, 45.9% of our portfolio
investments (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates, 38.3% paid fixed interest rates, 4.9% were income producing equity or other investments and the remainder (10.9%) consisted of
non-income producing equity or other investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to the variable rate investments we hold and
to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing
until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a   

  78  

Table of Contents   

  substantial
portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable
to the subordinated incentive fee on income and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to FS Advisor with respect to our
increased pre-incentive fee net investment income.   

          Pursuant
to the terms of the BNP facility, Barclays facility, Deutsche Bank credit facility, Fortress facility, Goldman facility, Natixis credit facility and Wells Fargo credit facility,
Berwyn Funding, Bryn Mawr Funding, FSEP Funding, Foxfields Funding, Strafford Funding, Energy Funding and Wayne Funding, respectively, borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. To
the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks
relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would
increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments.   

          The
following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income, assuming no changes in the
composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our borrowing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2016 (dollar amounts are presented in
thousands):   

We
expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes
in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities.   

          In
addition, we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation. See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Critical Accounting Policies Valuation of Portfolio Investments."    

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.            

          As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2016. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would
meet our disclosure obligations.   

          There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER CONFIRMATION   

The
purpose of this second amended and restated communication (this "   Confirmation   ") is to set forth the terms and conditions of the
above-referenced Repurchase Facility entered into on the Trade Date specified below between GS and Counterparty (the "   Facility   "). This communication
constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in the Master Repurchase Agreement specified below.    This communication supersedes and replaces all prior communications between the
parties hereto with respect to the Facility and Transactions described below.   

          This
Confirmation shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to, the Master Repurchase Agreement (including the Annexes thereto) dated as of September 11, 2014 and
amended and restated as of September 21, 2016, each as further amended or replaced from time to time (collectively, the "   Master Repurchase
Agreement   "), between GS and Counterparty. This Confirmation shall be read and construed as one with the executed Master Repurchase Agreement and all other outstanding
confirmations between the parties, so that all such confirmations, this Confirmation and the executed Master Repurchase Agreement constitute a single Agreement between the parties. Except as expressly
modified hereby, all provisions contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the Master Repurchase Agreement shall govern each Transaction hereunder. In the event of any inconsistencies between
the Master Repurchase Agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will govern with respect to the Transactions covered hereby (and the last sentence of Paragraph 3(b) of the Master
Repurchase Agreement shall not apply to any such Transaction). In the event of any inconsistencies between Annex A hereto and this Confirmation with respect to any Transaction, the terms of
Annex A with respect to such Transaction will govern. System-generated confirmations of trade may be generated by GS that set forth the trade terms of the individual repurchase transactions
described in this Confirmation; and, if any such system-generated confirmation of trade are generated and there is any inconsistency between such system-generated confirmations of trade and this
Confirmation or the Master Repurchase Agreement, then the terms of this Confirmation or the Master Repurchase Agreement, as the case may be, shall prevail. Capitalized terms not defined herein have
the meaning ascribed to them in the Master Repurchase Agreement.   

This Confirmation evidences a separate transaction with respect to each Purchased Security specified in Annex A from time to time (each, a
"   Transaction   ") as if the details specified in Annex A with respect to that Purchased Security were set out in the Confirmation in full. Each such
Transaction will have a unique Transaction Number as is set out in Annex A. The terms of the Facility and each particular Transaction to which this Confirmation relates are as follows:

treatment),    provided    that Counterparty is under no obligation to agree to any such restructuring or any other changes to the terms of this Confirmation or the Master Repurchase Agreement.

offer, last looks or other material restrictions or conditions to the transfer or assignment of such obligation (whether in the underlying instruments governing such obligation, in any intercreditor agreement or agreement among lenders relating to

For purposes of clauses (d) and (e) above, with respect to the Underlying Assets identified in Annex C hereto (each, a
"   Specified Transfer Asset   "), GS may, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem them to be Zero Value Assets if such Specified Transfer Assets do not cease to be Specified Transfer Assets within
30 days after the Restatement Date.  

A Specified Transfer Asset will cease to be a Specified Transfer Asset when:  

(a)  
     
      the Security Issuer delivers to the Trustee under the Security Indenture Escrowed Assignment Agreement Documents for such Specified Transfer
Asset and a Cooperation Agreement to be held by the Trustee under the Security Indenture, all in form and substance satisfactory to GS in its sole and absolute discretion,    provided    that GS in its sole
discretion may waive the requirements to deliver Escrowed Assignment Agreement Documents and/or a Cooperation Agreement for such Specified Transfer Asset; and

Asset.  

For purposes of the definition of "Zero Value Asset", GS may, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem amounts in excess of $25,000,000 of
the Asset Amortized Amount of a Synergy Asset to be a Zero Value Asset (such portion, the "   Synergy Zero Value Component   ", and the remainder of such Synergy Asset, the "   Synergy
Non-Zero Value Component   ") if, on or after the Restatement Date, Synergy incurs Material Synergy Debt (the date of such event, a "   Synergy Zero Value Event Date   "), whether or not
such Synergy Asset could otherwise be determined to be a Zero Value Asset;    provided    that the amount of the Synergy Zero Value Component shall not exceed the amount of such Material Synergy Debt. The
foregoing is without prejudice to the rights of GS to determine that the Synergy Non-Zero Value Component of such Synergy Asset constitutes a Zero Value Asset on the terms and conditions set forth herein.  

If the Asset Amortized Amount of such Synergy Asset is reduced at any time after a Synergy Zero Value Event Date, the amount of such reduction
shall be applied first to reduce the Synergy Zero Value Component and then to reduce the Synergy Non-Zero Value Component.

such event will constitute a "   Rejection Event   " and the Proposed Underlying Asset will constitute
a "   Rejected Underlying Asset   " unless the GS Consent Condition is subsequently satisfied with respect to such Proposed Underlying Asset within three Business Days after GS receives a Reduction Notice for
the related Reduction Event as described below.  

If the GS Consent Condition is not satisfied with respect to any Restructuring or any Material Modification of an Underlying Asset, such event
will constitute a "   Rejection Event   " and the Underlying Asset will also constitute a "   Rejected Underlying Asset   " unless the GS Consent Condition is
subsequently satisfied with respect to such Restructuring or Material Modification within three Business Days after GS receives a Reduction Notice for the related Reduction Event as described below.  

Each time three unique and consecutive Rejection Events occur (each with respect to Underlying Assets or Proposed Underlying Assets issued by
obligors unaffiliated with one another), such occurrence will constitute a "   Reduction Event   ", whereupon Counterparty may, by written notice to GS (each such notice, a "   Reduction
Notice   "), declare a "   Reduction Amount   " (with effect from the date of such Reduction Notice, each such date a "   Reduction Date   ") with

Underlying Asset that is or would have been acquired by the Security Issuer),    provided    that the Reduction Amount related to such Reduction Event shall be deemed reduced to zero (with effect from the date
of the related Reduction Notice) if, within three Business Days following the related Reduction Date, the GS Consent Condition is subsequently satisfied with respect to one or more of the Rejected Underlying Assets related to such Reduction
Event.  

For the avoidance of doubt, multiple Reduction Events may occur during the term of this Agreement entitling Counterparty to declare Reduction

calculation of a Margin Deficit or an Excess Cure Collateral Refund Amount (each, a "   Dispute   "), then for so long as such Dispute is continuing (and    provided   
that no Event of Default, Monetary Default or Other Material Default with respect to Counterparty occurs or is then continuing), upon the request of Counterparty, GS and Counterparty will work together in good faith to resolve such Dispute, it being
understood that Counterparty shall at all times during the pendency of each Dispute be required to comply with its obligations under Paragraph 4 of the Master Repurchase Agreement based upon the determinations of the Asset Market Related Amounts
of the Underlying Assets as determined by the Calculation Agent.  

GS agrees that, if any Dispute continues unresolved for more than five Business Days, a "   Dispute-Related Repurchase
Right   " shall be deemed to exist until the earlier to occur (if any) of (a) the resolution of such Dispute by the parties and (b) the occurrence of an Event of Default, a Monetary Default or an Other Material Default

7.    Additional Provisions   

Restriking Terms    

If for any period of five or more consecutive Business Days the net amount of cash margin held by GS under Paragraph 4 of the Master Repurchase Agreement exceeds 10% of the sum of the then-current Repurchase Prices
hereunder, then for so long as such condition is continuing (and    provided    that no Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default with
respect to Counterparty occurs or is then continuing), upon the request of Counterparty, GS and Counterparty will work together in good faith to restrike one or more of the economic terms of the Transactions under the Master Repurchase Agreement with
a view to reducing or eliminating the amount of cash margin then required to be posted to GS thereunder, it being understood that, in connection with any such restriking, GS may require that changes to other economic terms of the Transactions be made,
 and that changes to the terms of the Purchased Securities be made, in order to preserve the overall economic effect of the Transactions for GS.  

Limit on Optional Redemptions    

GS agrees that, for so long as any Transaction is outstanding under this Confirmation (unless an Event of Default with respect to Counterparty has occurred and is then continuing), it will not give the Security Issuer or
the Trustee under the Security Indenture any direction to effect a redemption (in whole or in part) of the Purchased Securities.  

Counterparty Note Restriction    

Counterparty agrees that, for so long as any Transaction is outstanding under this Confirmation, it shall not at any time (1) hold any portion of the Purchased Securities or (2) transfer any portion of the
Purchased Securities (other than pursuant to the provisions hereof and of the Master Repurchase Agreement).  

No Substitution Rights    

Seller may not substitute other Securities for the Purchased Security, unless otherwise agreed to by Purchaser in writing in its sole and absolute discretion.  

Indemnity    

Counterparty shall indemnify GS and each Related Party (as defined below) (each such person being referred to herein as an "   Indemnitee   ") against, and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of,

hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the Transaction or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;    provided    that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
 liabilities or related expenses have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee or a breach of the Master Repurchase Agreement or this Confirmation by GS.

As used herein "   Related Party   " means GS's affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors of GS and GS's affiliates.  

Taxes    

Each of the parties hereto intends and agrees to treat the Transaction, for United States income tax purposes, as a secured loan made by Buyer to Seller. Consistent with the Transaction being treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a secured loan made by Buyer to Seller, Buyer agrees to provide Seller with a Form 1099-INT (or any successor form) with respect to interest paid to Buyer and passed on to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the Master
Repurchase Agreement.  

Certain Voting Rights    

If GS has the right to exercise any Specified Voting Right in relation to any consent, vote, direction proposal or resolution arising at any time while this Transaction is outstanding, then:

   GS shall not exercise such Specified Voting Right unless and until directed to do so by Counterparty; and  

(c)  
      
   GS shall either (x) follow Counterparty's written instructions as to the manner and timing of exercising such Specified Voting Right or (y) procure that Counterparty may exercise such Specified Voting Right

1.    Counterparty
hereby represents to and acknowledges and agrees with GS that:

(i)    It
has consulted with its own tax advisors to the extent that it has deemed necessary, and it has made its own decisions regarding entering into the Facility based

      (ii)    The
fair value of the assets of Counterparty will exceed the debt and liabilities, subordinated, contingent and otherwise of Counterparty, and Counterparty will not

   2.    Each
party acknowledges and agrees that:

(i)    Unless
identified as an underwriter or arranger in an offering document relating to a Purchased Security, Underlying Asset or Unsettled Purchase Asset (each, an
"   Instrument   "), GS and its affiliates have played no role in structuring or arranging any Instrument or in negotiating or establishing the terms of such
Instrument. Whether or not GS or its affiliates are identified as an underwriter or arranger in any offering document relating to an Instrument, any and all information that may have been or is in the

other document, GS and Counterparty (and each employee, representative, or other agent of GS or Counterparty) may each disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. tax
treatment and U.S. tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to them relating to such U.S. tax treatment and U.S. tax

      (iv)    GS
and any of its affiliates may deal in any Instrument and may accept deposits from, make loans or otherwise extend credit to, and generally engage in any kind of
commercial or investment banking or other business with any issuer of or obligor on any Instrument, any affiliate thereof, any other person or entity having obligations relating to any Security Issuer
or any such issuer or obligor and may act with respect to such business in the same manner as if any Transaction did not exist and may originate, purchase, sell, hold or trade, and may exercise
consensual or remedial rights in respect of, obligations, securities or other financial instruments of, issued by or linked to the Security Issuer or any such issuer or obligor, regardless of whether
any such action might have an adverse effect on such Security Issuer, such issuer or such obligor, the value of the related Instrument or the position of the other party to such Transaction or
otherwise.
