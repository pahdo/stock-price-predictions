1.   
       NATURE
    OF OPERATIONS    

Business    

Corbus
Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, focused on the development
and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare, chronic, and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Since its
inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting
management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets and raising capital. The Company s business is subject to significant
risks and uncertainties and the Company will be dependent on raising substantial additional capital before it becomes profitable
and it may never achieve profitability.  

In
the opinion of management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect
all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from
audited financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed
consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 28, 2016. The results of operations for such interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year.  

2.   
       LIQUIDITY    

The
Company anticipates operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to research
funding, development of its product candidates and its preclinical and clinical programs, strategic alliances and the development
of its administrative organization. The Company has incurred recurring losses since inception and as of September 30, 2016, had
an accumulated deficit of $25,706,214. In June 2016, the Company completed a sale of shares of its common stock pursuant to the
terms of a securities purchase agreement under which the Company sold an aggregate of 5,960,000 shares of its common stock in
a registered direct offering to investors at a purchase price of $2.50 per share with net proceeds to the Company totaling approximately
$14,875,000. The Company expects the cash on hand of $18,909,348 at September 30, 2016 together with the remaining milestone payments
of $1,500,000 from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. ( CFFT ) which the Company expects to receive
in the first quarter of 2017 (See Note 13), to be sufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements into the fourth quarter
of 2017 based on current planned expenditures.  

Should
the Company be unable to raise sufficient additional capital, the Company may undertake cost-cutting measures including delaying
or discontinuing certain clinical activities. The Company will need to raise significant additional capital to continue to fund
the clinical trials for Resunab. The Company may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter
into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible
debt securities may result in dilution to the Company s stockholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior
to those of the Company s common shares. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock,
convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict
the Company s operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require the Company to relinquish valuable rights.  

The
source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically,
on the progress of the Company s clinical development programs. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on
terms acceptable to the Company. Lack of necessary funds may require the Company, among other things, to delay, scale back or
eliminate some or all of the Company s planned clinical trials.  

3.   
       SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

A
summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of the financial statements is as follows:  

Use
of Estimates    

The
process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and changes in estimates may occur. The most significant estimates are
related to stock based compensation, the accrual of research and clinical obligations, and revenue recognition under collaborative
arrangements.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and that mature within three months
from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable investments are those with original maturities in excess of three months.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds. The Company had no marketable
investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents consist of the following:  

Restricted
Cash    

Restricted
cash as of September 30, 2016 included a $150,000 collateral account for the Company s corporate credit cards. Additionally,
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 restricted cash included a $36,375 stand-by letter of credit issued in favor of
a landlord (See Note 5).  

Financial
Instruments    

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate fair
value based on the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying values of loans payable approximate their fair value due
to their market terms.  

Property
and Equipment    

The
estimated life for the Company s property and equipment is as follows: three years for computer hardware and software and
three to five years for office furniture and equipment. The Company s leasehold improvements and assets under capital lease
are amortized over the life of the respective leases. See Note 4 for details of property and equipment and Note 5 for operating
and capital lease commitments.  

Research
and Development Expenses and Collaborative Research Agreements    

Costs
incurred for research and development are expensed as incurred.  

For
amounts received under the development award received from the CFFT during 2015 and 2016 (See Note 13), the Company is amortizing
these amounts on a straight-line basis over the expected duration of the performance period of the development program under the
award, which is expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2017.  

Accruals
for Research and Development Expenses and Clinical Trials    

As
part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its
obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in
connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from
contract to contract and may result in payment terms that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided
under such contracts. The Company s objective is to reflect the appropriate expenses in its financial statements by matching
those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses
according to the timing of various aspects of the expenses. The Company determines accrual estimates through financial models
taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of clinical trials,
or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual
results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on
the facts and circumstances known to it at that time. The Company s clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely
and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although the Company does not expect
its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services
performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in it reporting amounts that
are too high or too low for any particular period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were
no material adjustments to the Company s prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk    

The
Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts
or other hedging arrangements. The Company may from time to time have cash in banks in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insurance limits.  

Segment
Information    

Operating
segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation
by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing
performance. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as principally one operating segment, which
is developing and commercializing therapeutics to treat rare life-threating, inflammatory fibrotic diseases. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, all of the Company s assets were located in the United States.  

Income
Taxes    

For
federal and state income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the
financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are based upon prescribed rates and enacted
laws applicable to periods in which differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a net deferred
tax benefit when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly,
given the cumulative losses since inception, the Company has provided a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the tax benefit in
order to eliminate the deferred tax assets amounts. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
Company s tax returns are required to be evaluated to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not 
of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.  

Tax
positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold, as well as accrued interest and penalties, if any, would be recorded
as a tax expense in the current year. There were no uncertain tax positions that require accrual or disclosure to the financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets    

The
Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when expected cash flows are less than an asset s carrying value.
Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of such assets in relation to
the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets. The Company s policy is to record
an impairment loss when it is determined that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. No impairment charges were
recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Share-based
Payments    

The
Company recognizes compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees and directors
as an expense in the statement of operations over the service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based
award. The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which
is generally the vesting period. Stock options granted to non-employee consultants are revalued at the end of each reporting period
until vested and the changes in their fair value are recorded as adjustments to expense over the related vesting period.  

Net
Loss Per Common Share    

Basic
net loss per share of the Company s common stock has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of the Company s common stock has been computed by dividing
net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding
stock options, warrants and convertible securities. In a net loss period, options, warrants and convertible securities are anti-dilutive
and therefore are excluded from diluted loss per share calculations. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
following potentially dilutive securities outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been excluded from the computation of
dilutive weighted average shares outstanding as the inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Accounting
for Share-Based Payments   

In
June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved
after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2014-12 ). ASU 2014-12
clarifies that entities should treat performance targets that can be met after the requisite service period of a share-based payment
award as performance conditions that affect vesting. Therefore, an entity would not record compensation expense (measured as of
the grant date without taking into account the effect of the performance target) related to an award for which transfer to the
employee is contingent on the entity s satisfaction of a performance target until it becomes probable that the performance
target will be met. There are no new disclosures required under ASU 2014-12. ASU 2014-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company s adoption of ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter
of 2016 had no impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.  

Reporting
of Going-Concern Uncertainties   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ) ,
 which states management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise a
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Management s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and likely
to occur at the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for the annual period ending after
December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, however, early application is permitted. Management
is not applying ASU 2014-15 early and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements, although there may be additional disclosures upon adoption.  

Accounting
for Leases   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ) .  Under ASU 2016-02, a
lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with
current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily
will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases
to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU 2016-02 will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU
2016-02 will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with
early application permitted. Management has not yet determined if it will adopt ASU 2016-02 earlier than the required adoption
date. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows,
and disclosures as the Company has an operating lease commitment for office space as of September 30, 2016 through January
2021 in the amount of $1,082,163 (see Note 5) for which ASU 2016-02 would apply.  

Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting   

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ) .  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee
share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements,
as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. Management is not applying ASU 2016-09
early and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements, although there may be additional disclosures upon adoption.  

4.   
       PROPERTY
    AND EQUIPMENT    

Property
and equipment consisted of the following:  

Depreciation
expense was $20,464 and $14,701 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $57,695 and $26,242 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

On
December 30, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a copier machine. The cost of the machine was approximately
$12,000 and is included in office furniture and equipment category in the table above. The lease payments commenced when the machine
was placed in service in January 2016. The machine is being amortized over the life of the lease, which is for a three-year term
and includes a bargain purchase option at the end of the term. See Note 5 for details of this capital lease commitment.  

At
December 31, 2015, construction in progress consisted of purchased property and equipment that was not placed in service until
January 2016 upon the Company s relocation into 6,326 square feet of office space. At September 30, 2016, construction in
progress consisted of purchased property and equipment that will not be placed in service until the Company begins occupation
of an additional 4,088 square feet of office space in November 2016. (See Note 5).  

5.   
       COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES    

Operating
Lease Commitment   

On
May 30, 2014, the Company entered into a commercial lease for 2,387 square feet of office space in Norwood, MA. The lease commenced
on July 1, 2014, had a three-year term, and required a standby letter of credit of $13,725 payable in favor of the landlord.

       COMMON
    STOCK    

The
Company has authorized 150,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of which 43,987,361 shares and 37,605,134
shares were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

In
June 2016, the Company completed a sale of shares of its common stock pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement
under which the Company sold an aggregate of 5,960,000 shares of its common stock in a registered direct offering to investors
at a purchase price of $2.50 per share with gross proceeds to the Company totaling approximately $14,900,000 less issuance costs
of $25,409.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 422,227 shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options
and warrants for proceeds of $360,693.  

In
April 2014, the Company adopted the Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ).
Pursuant to the 2014 Plan, the Company s Board of Directors may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted
stock to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors. Pursuant to the terms of an annual evergreen provision in the
2014 Plan, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2014 Plan shall be subject to an automatic annual
increase on January 1st of each year equal to the greater of (i) seven percent (7%) of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, or, (ii) the difference between (x) twenty percent (20%) of the total
number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and (y) the total number of shares
of common stock reserved under the 2014 Plan on December 31st of such preceding calendar year or a lesser number of shares of
common stock determined by the Company s Board of Directors. In accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan, effective as
of January 1, 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance
under the 2014 Plan in an amount of 1,250,000 shares, such amount being less than seven percent (7%) of the outstanding shares
of common stock on December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, there was a total of 9,916,017 shares reserved for issuance under
the 2014 Plan and there were 3,585,133 shares available for future grants. Options issued under the 2014 Plan are exercisable
for up to ten years from the date of issuance.  

Share-based
Compensation   

For
stock options issued and outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company recorded
non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $828,097 and $240,664, respectively, net of estimated forfeitures. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company recorded non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $1,522,345
and $843,527, respectively, net of estimated forfeitures.  

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions
noted in the following table. Due to its limited operating history and limited number of sales of its common stock, the Company
estimated its volatility in consideration of a number of factors, including the volatility of comparable public companies and,
commencing in 2015, the Company also included the volatility of its own common stock. The Company uses historical data, as well
as subsequent events occurring prior to the issuance of the financial statements, to estimate option exercises and employee terminations
within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted to employees under the 2014 Plan, all of which qualify as  plain
vanilla  per SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, is based on the average of the 6.25 years. For non-employee options, the
expected term is the contractual term. The risk-free rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a term consistent
with the option.  

The
assumptions used principally in determining the fair value of options granted were as follows:  

A
summary of option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and is presented below:  

The
weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.85 per share.
The average intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $610,608
and $95,108, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $6,134,356 of total unrecognized compensation expense,
related to non-vested share-based option compensation arrangements. The unrecognized compensation expense is estimated to be recognized
over a period of 2.71 years.  

At
September 30, 2016, there were warrants outstanding to purchase 1,789,250 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise
price of $1.00 and a weighted average remaining life of 2.66 years. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, warrants
to purchase 178,750 shares of common stock were exercised on a cashless basis resulting in the issuance of 161,591 shares and
1,250 shares of common stock were exercised on a for cash basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, warrants to
purchase 11,615,674 shares of common stock were exercised for net proceeds of approximately $10,817,326. There were no warrants
issued or cancelled during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

common stock was less than 10% as of September 30, 2016.  

Cystic
Fibrosis Development Award   

On
April 20, 2015, the Company entered into an award agreement with the CFFT, a non-profit drug discovery and development affiliate
of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, pursuant to which it received a development award (the  Award ) for up to $5 million
in funding. The funding from the Award is supporting a first-in-patient Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company s Resunab
drug in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Upon the execution of the Award agreement, the Company received a payment of $1,250,000
in May 2015 from the CFFT (See Notes 3 and 8). In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received a second payment of $1,250,000
from the CFFT upon the achievement of a milestone for dosing the first patient. In August 2016, the Company received a third payment
from the CFFT for achieving a milestone in July 2016 related to dosing the median clinical trial patient as per the terms of the
Award in the amount of $1,000,000. The Company recorded these amounts received from the CFFT totaling $3,500,000 as deferred revenue.
The Company is amortizing these amounts on a straight-line basis over the expected duration of the performance period of the development
program under the award, which is expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2017. The remaining $1,500,000 under the Award
is expected to be paid to the Company incrementally in the first quarter of 2017 upon the achievement of certain milestones related
to the progress of the Phase 2 CF clinical trial, as set forth in the Award agreement.  

Pursuant
to the terms of the Award agreement, the Company is obligated to make royalty payments to the CFFT contingent upon commercialization
of Resunab in the Field of Use (as defined in the Award agreement) including a royalty payment equal to five times the amount
the Company receives under the Award agreement, up to $25 million, payable in three equal annual installments following the first
commercial sale of Resunab, the first of which is due within 90 days following the first commercial sale of Resunab. The Company
is also obligated to make a royalty payment to CFFT equal to the amount the Company receives under the Award agreement, up to
$5 million, due in the first calendar year in which the aggregate cumulative net sales of Resunab in the Field of Use exceed $500
million. Lastly, the Company is obligated to make royalty payment(s) to the CFFT of up to approximately $15 million if the Company
transfers, sells or licenses Resunab in the Field of Use other than for certain clinical or development purposes, or if the Company
enters into a change of control transaction, with such payment(s) to be credited against the royalty payments due upon commercialization.
The Field of Use is defined in the Award as the treatment in humans of CF, asbestosis, bronchiectasis, byssinosis, chronic bronchitis/COPD
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pneumoconiosis, primary ciliary dyskinesis, sarcoidosis and silicosis. Either the CFFT or the Company
may terminate the agreement for cause, which includes the Company s material failure to achieve certain commercialization
and development milestones. The Company s payment obligations survive the termination of the Award agreement.

Overview

We
are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare
or uncommon chronic and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases with clear unmet medical needs. Our product Resunab is a novel
synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug that is intended to resolve chronic inflammation and halt fibrotic processes without
causing immunosuppression.  

Resunab
is a synthetic, rationally-designed oral small molecule drug that selectively binds to the cannabinoid receptor type 2, or CB2,
which is found on activated immune cells, fibroblasts and muscle cells. Resunab stimulates the production of Specialized Pro-Resolving
Lipid Mediators, or SPMs, which act to resolve inflammation, and halt fibrosis by activating endogenous pathways. These endogenous
resolution pathways are normally activated in healthy individuals during the course of normal immune responses but are dysfunctional
in chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Through its activation of the CB2 receptor, Resunab is designed to move innate
immune responses from the activation phase through completion of the resolution phase. The CB2 receptor plays an endogenous role
in modulating and resolving inflammation by, in effect, turning heightened inflammation  off  and restoring homeostasis.  

Resunab
is currently being evaluated in three separate Phase 2 studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, diffuse cutaneous systemic
sclerosis ( systemic sclerosis ) and diffuse cutaneous skin-predominant dermatomyositis. Top-line data from the systemic
sclerosis study is expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 and from the cystic fibrosis study in the first
quarter of 2017. Patient enrollment in the dermatomyositis study is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter
of 2017. The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted Resunab Orphan Drug Designation as well as Fast Track Status
for both cystic fibrosis and systemic sclerosis. A fourth Phase 2 study of Resunab in systemic lupus erythematosus, ( SLE )
is planned to start during the first half of 2017.  

In
April 2016, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for a 12-month open-label extension study
of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of Resunab for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. The goal of the open label extension
study is to provide all subjects with the option of receiving Resunab following the completion of the 84-day treatment period
in the ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled study and to collect long term safety and efficacy data on Resunab. All subjects
in the 12-month extension study will receive Resunab, including those who received placebo in the current 84-day, double-blind
placebo controlled trial. The same clinical endpoints used in the double-blinded placebo-controlled portion of the trial will
be monitored throughout the 12-month extension study.  

Financial
Operations Overview   

We
are a research and development company and have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. We have never been profitable
and, from inception through September 30, 2016, our losses from operations have been approximately $25.7 million. Our net losses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $12,428,000 and $6,352,000, respectively. We expect to
continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses to increase
significantly in connection with our ongoing activities to develop, seek regulatory approval and commercialize Resunab. Accordingly,
we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. We will seek to fund our operations through public or
private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include government grants and collaborations with third parties.
Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when
needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to
generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.  

We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect
our expenses will increase substantially during the balance of 2016 and in 2017 and in the future in connection with our ongoing
activities, as we:  

conduct
    clinical trials for Resunab in systemic sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus and other
    indications;   

continue
    our research and development efforts;   

manufacture
    clinical study materials and develop commercial scale manufacturing capabilities;   

seek
    regulatory approval for our product candidates;   

add
    personnel to support development of our product candidates; and   

operate
    as a public company   

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  

On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments for all assets and liabilities, including those related to stock-based
compensation expense. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and
on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

We
believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to, and the consolidated financial
statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods
presented.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Collaboration
Revenue   

To
date, we have not generated any revenues from the sales of products. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless
and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of Resunab, which we expect will
take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty.  

We
have recorded $742,558 and $170,454 of collaboration revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
related to an award agreement we entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics,
Inc. ( CFFT ), a non-profit drug discovery and development affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, pursuant to
which we received a development award (the  Award ) for up to $5 million in funding. The funding from the Award is
supporting the Phase 2 clinical trial of Resunab in adults with cystic fibrosis. Upon the execution of the Award agreement, we
received a payment of $1,250,000 in May 2015. In November 2015, we received a second payment of $1,250,000 upon the achievement
of a milestone for dosing the first patient. In August 2016, we received a third payment from the CFFT for achieving a milestone
in July 2016 related to dosing the median clinical trial patient as per the terms of the Award in the amount of $1,000,000. We
recorded these three milestone payments received from the CFFT totaling $3,500,000 as deferred revenue and they are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over the expected duration of the performance period of the development program under the Award, which
is expected to conclude in February 2017. We expect that the remaining $1,500,000 under the Award will be paid to us incrementally
in the first quarter of 2017 upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the progress of the Phase 2 CF clinical trial,
as set forth in the Award agreement.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses are incurred for the development of Resunab and consist primarily of payroll, and payments to contract
research and development companies. To date, these costs are related to generating pre-clinical data and the cost of manufacturing
Resunab for clinical trials and conducting clinical trials. These costs are expected to increase significantly in the future as
Resunab is evaluated in clinical trials.  

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $4,316,000, an increase of approximately
$2,681,000 over the $1,635,000 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable
to increases of $2,109,000 in clinical trial costs, $441,000 in compensation costs, and $131,000 in stock-based compensation expense.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll, rent, and professional services. Other general and administrative expenses
include accounting and legal services and expenses associated with being a public company. We anticipate that our general and
administrative expenses will increase significantly during the balance of 2016 and in the future as we increase our headcount
to support our continued research and development and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate
increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with NASDAQ
exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance, and investor relations costs associated with being a public
company.  

General
and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $1,761,000, an increase of approximately
$970,000 over the $791,000 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to
increases of approximately $456,000 in stock-based compensation expense, $355,000 in compensation costs, and $134,000 in investor
relations costs.  

Other
Income (Expense), Net   

Other
income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency  exchange transaction gains
and losses , interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt, and interest income we earn on interest-bearing accounts.  

Other
expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $13,000 as compared to other income, net of approximately
$1,000 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and was primarily attributable to exchange rate losses recorded
during the third quarter of 2016.  

Comparison
of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Collaboration
Revenue   

We
have recorded $1,535,754 and $284,090 of collaboration revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
related to the agreement with the CFFT.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $10,057,000, an increase of approximately
$5,991,000 over the $4,065,000 recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable
to increases of $4,803,000 in clinical trial costs, $836,000 in compensation costs, and $352,000 in stock-based compensation expense.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $3,892,000, an increase of approximately
$1,320,000 over the $2,572,000 recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable
to increases of approximately $616,000 in compensation costs, $326,000 in stock-based compensation expense, $268,000 in investor
relations costs, and $163,000 in legal costs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $100,000 in NASDAQ fees.  

Other
Income (Expense), Net   

Other
expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $16,000 as compared to other income, net of approximately
$1,000 recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency
exchange transaction losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Since
inception, we have experienced significant negative cash flows from operations. We have financed our operations primarily through
sales of equity-related securities. In addition, the majority of the costs of our dermatomyositis and SLE clinical trials are
being funded by grants from the National Institute of Health paid directly to its grantees, which include the participating clinical
investigators and contract research organizations engaged in these clinical trials. Our cystic fibrosis clinical trial is being
partially funded by a $5 million award from the CFFT, under which we have received an aggregate of $3.5 million from the CFFT
since the inception of the award through September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, our accumulated deficit since inception was
approximately $25,706,000.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of approximately $19,225,000 and total current liabilities of approximately $6,427,000
resulting in working capital of approximately $12,798,000. At September 30, 2016, we had total assets of approximately $19,757,000
and total liabilities of approximately $6,443,000 resulting in a stockholders  equity of approximately $13,314,000.  

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $8,243,000 which includes a net
loss of approximately $12,428,000, non-cash expenses of approximately $1,580,000 and $2,606,000 of cash provided from a change
in net working capital items.  

Cash
used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $257,000 for the purchase of property
and equipment.  

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $15,071,000 and was principally
related to the sale of 5,960,000 shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering to investors in June 2016 at a purchase
price of $2.50 per share which resulted in net proceeds to us totaling approximately $14,875,000. Additionally, during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we received proceeds of approximately $361,000 from the issuance of 422,227 shares of our common
stock upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 included principal payments on notes payable of approximately $162,000, which was paid in full as of September 30, 2016.
In October 2016, we entered into a loan agreement with a financing company for $348,750. The terms of the loan stipulate
equal monthly payments of principal and interest payments of $39,114 over a nine-month period. Interest accrues on this loan at
an annual rate of 2.25%.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of approximately $18,909,000. We expect our cash on hand at September 30, 2016, together
with the remaining milestone payments of $1,500,000 from the CFFT, which we expect to receive in the first quarter of 2017, to
be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements into the fourth quarter of 2017 based on current planned expenditures.  

We
will need to raise significant additional capital to continue to fund operations and the clinical trials for Resunab. We may seek
to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party
funding, or seek other debt financing. In addition, we may seek to raise cash through collaborative agreements or from government
grants. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and certain of those securities
may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible
debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations.
Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights.  

The
source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically,
on the progress of our clinical development programs. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable
to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us, among other things, to delay, scale back or eliminate expenses including some or
all of our planned clinical trials.  

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments    

The
following table presents information about our known contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016. It does not reflect contractual
obligations that may have arisen or may arise after that date. Except for historical facts, the information in this section is
forward-looking information.  

(1)  
      In
    September 2016, we entered into an amendment to our office space lease agreement for expansion into an additional 4,088 square
    feet of office space within the existing building ( September 2016 Amendment ). We began occupying this space
    in early November 2016 and the final lease payment per the terms of the September 2016 Amendment is due in January 2021. Additionally,
    the September 2016 Amendment requires an increase in the standby letter of credit to $50,000.    

(2)  
      On
    December 30, 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for a copier machine. The lease payments commenced when the machine was
    placed in service in January 2016. The lease is for a three-year term and includes a bargain purchase option at the end of
    the term.   

We
may enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials and clinical
supply manufacturing and with vendors for pre-clinical research studies, research supplies and other services and products for
operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore, we believe that our non-cancelable
obligations under these agreements are not material. As of September 30, 2016, other than our lease for office space and the lease
agreement for the copier machine, we had no material contractual obligations or commitments that will affect our future liquidity.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Our
exposure to market risk is limited to our cash and cash equivalents, all of which have maturities of three months or less. The
primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly
increasing risk. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general
level of U.S. interest rates. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden change in
market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operation.
We do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Our Disclosure Controls   

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as amended) as of September 30, 2016.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that the information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Evaluation
of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the period to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. From time to time, we make changes to our internal control over financial reporting that are intended
to enhance its effectiveness and which do not have a material effect on our overall internal control over financial reporting.

   Premises and Term     

2.1
 Premises  . Landlord hereby Leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby Leases from Landlord, subject to and with the benefit
of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease, the Premises, excluding exterior faces of exterior walls, the
common stairways, stairwells, elevators and elevator shafts, and pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures servicing
exclusively or in common other parts of the Building, and if Tenant s space includes less than the entire rentable area
of any floor, excluding the central core area of such floor.  

Tenant
shall have, as appurtenant to the Premises, rights to use in common, subject to reasonable rules of general applicability to tenants
of the Building from time to time made by Landlord of which Tenant is given notice: (a) the common lobbies, hallways, stairways
and elevators of the Building, (b) the common pipes, ducts, conduits, wire and appurtenant fixtures serving the Premises, (c)
common walkways and driveways necessary for access to the Building, (d) the common parking areas serving the Building, and (e)
if the Premises include less than the entire rentable area of any floor, the common toilets and other common facilities in the
central core area of such floor.  

Landlord
reserves the right from time to time (with reasonable prior notice to Tenant, except in emergencies), in such manner as to reduce
to a minimum interference with Tenant s use of the Premises (so long as services to the Premises and the Building s
common areas are not diminished): (a) to install, use, maintain, repair, replace and relocate for service to the Premises and
other parts of the Building, pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures, however located in the Premises or Building,

deem necessary, and (d) in connection with any excavation made upon adjacent land of Landlord or others, to enter, and to license
others to enter, upon the Premises to do such work as the person causing such excavation deems necessary to preserve the wall
of the Building from injury or damage and to support the same.  

2.2
 Term.    

2.2.1
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD for a term (the  Term ) beginning on the Commencement Date and continuing for a period of three
(3) years. The  Commencement Date  shall be the date upon which the Landlord s Work (as defined in Section 3.2

no later than July 1, 2014.  

2.2.2
If the Landlord s Work is not so substantially completed on or prior to August 15, 2014 (other than due to delays caused
by Tenant or fire or casualty) Tenant may terminate this Lease by notice to Landlord given before such substantial completion.  

If
the Landlord s Work is not so substantially completed by August 15, 2014 (other than due to delays caused by Tenant or by
fire or casualty or other reasons beyond the Landlord s reasonable control), then for each day subsequent to August 15,
2014 that such work is not so substantially completed, the Tenant shall have a special credit against the rent hereunder equal
to one day of such rent.

The annual base rent during the Extended Term shall be equal to an amount representative of the then Fair Market Rent of the Premises
as of the commencement of the Extended Term.  Fair Market Rent  shall be based on the rent generally payable in the
general area of Norwood, Massachusetts for space approximately the same size, level of Landlord improvement and location as the
Building for an equivalent term and for similar terms and conditions as contained in the Lease, taking into account all relevant
factors.  

(b)
Within thirty (30) days after Tenant exercises its option to extend, Landlord will advise Tenant in writing ( Landlord s
Rental Notice ) of its determination of Fair Market Rent for the Premises. If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on the Fair
Market Rent for the Extended Term within fifteen (15) day of Tenant s receipt of Landlord s Rental Notice, then within
thirty (30) days after such failure to reach agreement, Tenant shall have the right to submit to Landlord a notice in writing
( Tenant s Rental Determination ) stating what Tenant perceives to be the Fair Market Rent projected to the
commencement date of the Extended Term. Landlord and Tenant shall again endeavor to agree on the Fair Market Rent. If within fifteen
(15) days of Tenant s submittal of Tenant s Rental Determination, Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on the Fair Market
Rent, they shall each appoint an appraiser who is a member of the Member Appraisal Institute (MAI) of the American Institute of
Real Estate Appraisers or a real estate broker with at least five (5) years of experience leasing office space in the area in
which the Building is located. In the event either party fails to so appoint an appraiser on or before the day specified in the
preceding sentence, the person appointed as the appraiser may appoint an appraiser to represent the expiration of such period.
The two appraisers appointed in either manner shall then proceed to appraise the Premises and determine its Fair Market Rent.
In the event of their inability to reach a determination of such Fair Market Rent within thirty (30) days after their appointment,
then they shall select a third appraisals. Landlord and Tenant agree to be bound by the determination of the Fair Market Rent
of the Premises by the appraisers; provided, however, Landlord and Tenant agree that (a) if said determination exceeds the rental
determination set forth in Landlord s Rental Notice, the Rent during the Extended Term shall equal the amount set forth
in Landlord s Rental Notice, and (b) if said determination is less than Tenant s Rent Determination, the Fixed Rent
during the Extended Term shall equal Tenant s Rent Determination. Each party shall be responsible for the fees and disbursements
of its appraiser and attorneys, and the parties shall share equally the fees and disbursements of the third appraiser.  

(c)
In order to exercise the right to extend as provided in this Section 2.3, the Tenant must give the Landlord written notice nine
(9) months prior to the expiration of the Term. As used in this Lease,  Term  shall mean the original Term as may
be extended hereunder.

or security against any loss, cost or expense on account thereof. Landlord acknowledges that the Premises are currently free of

authority or for any public use or destroyed by the action of any public authority (a  Taking ), then this Lease may

laws or ordinances then in existence, which, unless Landlord or Tenant has exercised its option to terminate pursuant to Section
7.1, Landlord covenants to do with reasonable diligence at Landlord s expense. Landlord s obligations with respect

 Events of Default  . (a) If Tenant shall default in the performance of any of its obligations to pay the Fixed Rent or
Additional Rent hereunder and if such default shall continue for ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord designating
such default or if within thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant specifying any other default or defaults
Tenant has not commenced diligently to correct the default or defaults so specified or has not thereafter diligently pursued such
correction to completion, or (b) if any assignment of the Lease shall be made by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for the benefit
of creditors, or (c) if Tenant s Leasehold interest shall be taken on execution, or (d) if a lien or other involuntary encumbrance
is filed against Tenant s Leasehold interest, and is not discharged within ten (10) days thereafter, or (e) if a petition
is filed by Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant for liquidation, or for reorganization or an arrangement under any provision of
any bankruptcy law or code as then in force and effect, or (f) if an involuntary petition under any of the provisions of any bankruptcy
law or code is filed against Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant and such involuntary petition is not dismissed within sixty (60)
days thereafter, then, and in any of such cases, Landlord and the agents and servants of Landlord may, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, in addition to and not in derogation of any remedies for any preceding breach of covenant, immediately or at
any time thereafter without demand or notice and with or without process of law (forcibly, if necessary) enter into and upon the
Premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole or mail a notice of termination addressed to Tenant, and repossess the same
as of Landlord s former estate and expel Tenant and those claiming through or under Tenant and remove its and their effects
(forcibly, if necessary) without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass and without prejudice to any remedies which might
otherwise be used for arrears of rent or prior breach of covenant, and upon such entry or mailing as aforesaid this Lease shall
terminate, Tenant hereby waiving all statuary rights to the Premises (including without limitation rights of redemption, if any,
to the extent such rights may be lawfully waived) and Landlord, without notice to Tenant, may store Tenant s effects, and
those of any person claiming through or under Tenant, at the expense and risk of Tenant, and, if Landlord so elects, may sell
such effects at public auction or private sale and apply the net proceeds to the payment of all sums due to Landlord from Tenant,
if any, and pay over the balance, if any, to Tenant.   

8.2
 Remedies  . In the event that this Lease is terminated under any of the provisions contained in Section 8.1 or shall
be otherwise terminated for breach of any obligation of Tenant, Tenant covenants to pay punctually to Landlord all the sums and
to perform all the obligations which Tenant covenants in this Lease to pay and to perform in the same manner and to the same extent
and at the same time as if this Lease had not been terminated. In calculating the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the
preceding sentence Tenant shall be credited with the net proceeds of any rent obtained by Landlord by reletting the Premises,
after deducting all Landlord s reasonable expense in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all
repossession costs, brokerage commissions, fees for legal services and expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting (excluding
the cost of any buildout incurred for any new tenant), it being agreed by Tenant that Landlord may (i) relet the Premises or any
part or parts thereof, for a term or terms which may at Landlord s option be equal to or less than or exceed the period
which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term and may grant such concessions and free rent as Landlord in its
sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same and (ii) make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the
Premises as Landlord in its sole judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same, and no action of Landlord in accordance
with the foregoing or failure to relet or to collect rent under reletting shall operate or be construed to release or reduce Tenant s
liability as aforesaid. In lieu of the foregoing, Landlord may elect to recover, and Tenant shall pay forthwith to Landlord, as
compensation, the excess of the total rent reserved for the residue of the Term over the rental value of the Premises for said
residue of the Term discounted at the then discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. In calculating the rent reserved
there shall be included, in addition to the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, the value of all other considerations agreed to be
paid or performed by Tenant for said residue. Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate damages.   

8.3
 Remedies Cumulative  . Any and all rights and remedies which Landlord or Tenant may have under this Lease, and at law
and in equity, shall be cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and any two or more of all such rights
and remedies may be exercised at the same time insofar as permitted by law.   

8.4
 Landlord s Right to Cure Defaults  . Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, cure, at any time, after written
notice to Tenant as required by Section 8.1, any default by Tenant under this Lease; and whenever Landlord so elects, all costs
and expenses incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorneys  fees, in curing a default shall be paid, as Additional
Rent, by Tenant to Landlord on demand, together with lawful interest thereon from the date of payment by Landlord to the date
of payment by Tenant.   

8.5
 Effect of Waivers of Default  . Any consent or permission by either party hereunder to any act or omission which otherwise
would be a breach of any covenant or condition herein, shall not in any way be held or construed (unless expressly so declared)
to operate so as to impair the continuing obligation of any covenant or condition herein, or otherwise, except as to the specific
instance, operate to permit similar acts or omissions.   

8.6
 No Waiver, Etc  . The failure of either party hereunder to seek redress for violation of, or to insist upon the strict
performance of, any covenant or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation nor prevent a subsequent
act, which would have originally constituted a violation. The receipt by Landlord of rent with knowledge of the breach of any
covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by Landlord. No consent or waiver, express or
implied, by either party hereunder to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or
of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty.   

8.7
 No Accord and Satisfaction  . No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other
charge then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent or charge due, nor shall
any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent or other charge be deemed an
accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check of payment without prejudice to Landlord s right to recover
the balance of such installment or pursue any other remedy in this Lease provided.

similar instruments evidencing other voluntary liens or encumbrances, and modifications, consolidations, extensions, renewals,
replacements and substitutes thereof. The word  holder  shall mean a mortgagee, and any subsequent holder or holders
of a mortgage. Until the holder of a mortgage shall enter and take possession of the Property for the purpose of foreclosure,

of Landlord.   

The
covenants and agreements contained in this Lease with respect to the rights, powers and benefits of a holder of a mortgage (particularly,
without limitation thereby, the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 9.1) constitute a continuing offer to any person,
corporation or other entity, which by accepting a mortgage subject to this Lease, assumes the obligations herein set forth with
respect to such holder; such holder is hereby constituted a party of this Lease as an obligee hereunder to the same extent as
though its name were written hereon as such; and such holder shall be entitled to enforce such provisions in its own name. Tenant
agrees on request of Landlord to execute and deliver from time to time any agreement which may be necessary to implement the provisions
of this Section 9.1.

by notice to Tenant to subject or subordinate the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease to such mortgage or (ii) prior
to any present or future mortgage or mortgages, if Landlord shall elect, by notice to Tenant, to give the rights and interest
of Tenant under this Lease priority to such mortgage; in the event of either of such elections and upon notification by Landlord
to that effect, the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease should be deemed to be subordinate to, or have priority over,
as the case may be, said mortgage or mortgages, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any such mortgage
or mortgages (provided that, in the case of subordination of this Lease to any future mortgages, the holder thereof agrees (i)
to abide by the terms and conditions of this Lease and (ii) not to disturb the possession of Tenant so long as Tenant is not in
default hereunder). Tenant agrees it will, upon request of Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all instruments
deemed by Landlord necessary or desirable to give effect to or notice of such subordination or priority. Any mortgage to which
this Lease shall be subordinated may contain such terms, provisions and conditions as the holder deems usual or customary.   

At
the request of Tenant, Landlord shall obtain on Tenant s behalf an agreement from any present holder of a mortgage on the
Property that such holder, in exercising any of its rights under such mortgage, shall not disturb the possession or any other
rights of Tenant under this Lease and that such mortgagee will accept Tenant as Tenant of the Premises under the terms and conditions
of this Lease so long as Tenant performs its obligations hereunder and agrees to attorn to such mortgagee.

in writing, for the benefit of the Tenant, to assume Landlord s obligations under the Lease from and after the date of transfer;
and (2) if Landlord assigns its interest in this Lease as additional security, this assignment shall not release Landlord from
its obligations under this Lease. Tenant, its successors and assigns, shall not assert nor seek to enforce any claim for breach
of this Lease against any of Landlord s assets other than Landlord s interest in the Property and in the rents, issues
and profits thereof, and Tenant agrees to look solely to such interest for the satisfaction of any liability or claim against
Landlord under this Lease, it being specifically agreed that in no event whatsoever shall Landlord (which term shall include,
without limitation, any general or limited partner, trustees, beneficiaries, officers, directors, or stockholders of Landlord)
ever be personally liable for any such liability. Landlord hereby covenants and represents that it is as of the date of this Lease
the sole owner of the Building and the Property.   

10.5
 Acts of God  . In any case where either party hereto is required to do any act, then delays caused by or resulting from
a Force Majeure Event shall not be counted in determining the time during which work shall be completed, whether such time be
designated by a fixed date, a fixed time or a  reasonable time , and such time shall be deemed to be extended by the
period of such delay; provided that the affected party uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize such delay and the affected
party s negligence or misconduct did not contribute to the same. However, Force Majeure should not delay the payment of
rent.   

10.6
 Landlord s Default  . Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations
hereunder unless it shall fail to perform such obligations and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days or
such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default after written notice has been given by Tenant to Landlord
specifying the nature of Landlord s alleged default.   

10.6.1
 Landlord s Default - Tenant s Remedy  . If Tenant is prevented from using and does not use, all or part of
the Premises as a result of Landlord s default and, if the default continues for five consecutive business days after Landlord s
receipt of notice from Tenant of the alleged default, the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent payable under this Lease shall be abated
or reduced from that 5 day period for such time that Tenant continued to be prevented from using, and does not use, the affected
area of the Premises, in the proportion that the affected area bears to the total rentable area of the Premises.   

10.7
 After Hours and Holiday Heating and Air Conditioning  . Heating and air conditioning can be provided to Tenant during
evenings, weekends and holidays provided that the Landlord receives at least twenty four (24) hours prior written notice from
the Tenant of the need for heat or air conditioning. The charge for such service is thirty five ($35.00) dollars per hour which
amount is subject to increase as utility costs increase. Any charges for this service shall be due and payable on the first of
the following month.   

10.8
 Applicable Law and Construction  . This Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts and, if any provisions of this Lease shall to any extent be invalid, the remainder of this Lease shall not be
affected thereby. There are no oral or written agreements between Landlord and Tenant affecting this Lease. This Lease may be
amended, and the provisions hereof may be waived or modified only by instruments in writing executed by Landlord and Tenant. The
titles of the several Articles and Sections contained herein are for convenience only and shall not be considered in construing
this Lease. Unless repugnant to the context, the words  Landlord  and  Tenant  appearing in this Lease
shall be construed to mean those named above and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and
those claiming through or under them respectively. If there be more than one tenant the obligations imposed by this Lease upon
Tenant shall be joint and several.   

10.9
 Brokerage  . Landlord and Tenant represent to each other that they have not dealt with any real estate brokers or sales
representatives other than CB Richard Ellis/Whittier Partners ( Brokers ) in connection with this Lease. Landlord
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Tenant, and Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Landlord from and against all threatened
or asserted claims, liabilities, costs or damages (including reasonable attorney s fees and disbursements) which they may
incur as a result of a breach of this representation. Landlord agrees to pay Broker commission(s) in accordance with a separate
written agreement.   

IN

hereof, as a sealed instrument on the day and year noted in Exhibit I as the Execution Date.
