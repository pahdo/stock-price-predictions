 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     1.    Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
 Description of Business 
 NuVasive, Inc. (the  Company  or  NuVasive ) was incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 1997, and began commercializing its products in 2001. The Company s principal product offering includes a minimally-disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS. The MAS platform combines three categories of solutions that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during spine fusion surgery, provide maximum visualization and are designed to enable safe and reproducible outcomes for the surgeon and the patient. The platform includes the Company s proprietary software-driven nerve detection and avoidance systems and Intraoperative Monitoring ( IOM ) services and support; MaXcess, an integrated split-blade retractor system; and a wide variety of specialized implants and biologics. The Company also recently launched Integrated Global Alignment ( iGA ), in which products and computer assisted technology under the MAS platform help achieve more precise spinal alignment. The individual components of the MAS platform, and many of the Company s products, can also be used in open or traditional spine surgery. The Company continues to focus research and development efforts to expand its MAS product platform and advance the applications of its unique technology into procedurally-integrated surgical solutions. The Company dedicates significant resources toward training spine surgeons on its unique technology and products. 
 The Company s primary business model is to loan its MAS systems to surgeons and hospitals that purchase implants, biologics and disposables for use in individual procedures. In addition, for larger customers, the Company s proprietary nerve monitoring systems, MaXcess and surgical instrument sets are placed with hospitals for an extended period at no up-front cost to them. The Company also offers a range of bone allograft in patented saline packaging, disposables and spine implants, which include its branded CoRoent products and fixation devices such as rods, plates and screws. The Company sells MAS instrument sets, MaXcess and nerve monitoring systems to hospitals, however, such sales are immaterial to the Company s results of operations. 
 On February 11, 2016, the Company acquired Ellipse Technologies, Inc. ( Ellipse Technologies ), which now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary under the renamed legal entity NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics, Inc. ( NSO ).  NSO designs and sells expandable growing rod implant systems that can be non-invasively lengthened following implantation with precise, incremental adjustments via an external remote controller using magnetic technology called MAGnetic External Control, or MAGEC. The technology platform provides the basis of NSO s core product offerings, including MAGEC-EOS, which allows for the minimally invasive treatment of early-onset and adolescent scoliosis, as well as the PRECICE limb lengthening system, which allows for the correction of long bone limb length discrepancy, as well as enhanced bone healing in patients that have experienced traumatic injury. 
 On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired BNN Holdings Corp., which  through its subsidiaries and affiliates, owns and operates Biotronic NeuroNetwork, a patient-centric healthcare organization that provides intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring services to surgeons and healthcare facilities across the U.S.  The Company combined the service offerings of  Biotronic NeuroNetwork with its Impulse Monitoring, Inc. business under the newly created division NuVasive Clinical Services ( NCS ).   
 The Company intends to continue development on a wide variety of projects intended to broaden surgical applications for greater procedural integration of its MAS techniques and additional applications of the MAGEC technology. Such applications include tumor, trauma, and deformity, as well as increased fixation options and sagittal alignment products. The Company also expects to continue expanding its other product and services offerings as it executes on its strategy to offer customers an end-to-end, integrated procedural solution for spine surgery.   
 Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
   The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include  the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, collectively referred to as either NuVasive or the Company. The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. When there is a portion of equity in an acquired subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the respective parent entity, the Company records the fair value of the non-controlling interests at the acquisition date and classifies the amounts attributable to non-controlling interests separately in equity in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Any subsequent changes in a parent's ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Secur  ities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Pursuant to these rules and regulations, the Company has condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures it normally includes in its annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordanc  e with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). Operating results for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for t  he full year. These Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K fil  ed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature that are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and of the res  ults of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  
  The Company has reclassified historically presented product line revenue to conform to the current period presentation.  The Company has also reclassified certain operating expenses into business transition costs.  Both reclassifications have no impact on previously reported results of operations or financial position . Refer to section   Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  below for information regarding historical financial information adjusted for a  change in accounting policy. 
 Change in Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), an updated standard on revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 provides enhancements to the quality and consistency of how revenue is reported by companies while also improving comparability in the financial statements of companies reporting using International Financial Reporting Standards or GAAP. The main purpose of the new standard is for companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact of implementation and transition approach of this standard on its financial statements but does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements. 
 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ), which requires that (i) all equity investments, other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated entities generally be measured at fair value through earnings and (ii) when the fair value option has been elected for financial liabilities, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. Additionally, the ASU 2016-01 changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The new standard will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt certain provisions early. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued  Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases,  which outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance. The new accounting standard requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms of greater than 12 months. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The new accounting standard must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt the new guidance early.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses  , which changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets. Under the new guidance, credit losses for certain   types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses. The new guidance also modifies the impairment models for available-for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. Th  e new guidance will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its   consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt the new guidance early.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization. ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The retrospective transition method, requiring adjustment to all comparative periods presented, is required unless it is impracticable for some of the amendments, in which case those amendments would be prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption to have any significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 In April 2014, the FASB issued  Accounting Standards Update  No. 2015-03 amended requirements that require debt issuance costs, related to a recognized debt liability, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 applied retroactively for all consolidated balance sheets presented. The Company applied the amended presentation requirements in the first quarter 2016, which does not have a material impact on its financial statements. This change resulted in a reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to senior convertible notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented. See Note 6 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for revised presentation. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ),  which simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new standard requires the immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, and requires classification of excess tax benefits as an operating activity as opposed to a financing activity in the statements of cash flows. The provisions of the new standard are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the second quarter 2016, which requires any adjustments to be recorded as of the beginning of fiscal 2016. As a result, the Company recorded a modified retrospective adjustment of $16.6 million to deferred tax assets and accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2016, and a retrospective adjustment to the previously reported first quarter 2016 provision for income taxes of approximately $5.5 million for the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital. This resulted in a decrease in net loss per share of $0.11 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company elected to apply the change in classification for excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows on a prospective basis, and elected to continue estimating stock-based compensation award forfeitures in determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized each period.  
 Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains or losses on the Company s marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. The cumulative translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were a net cumulative loss of $5.9 million and $11.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 Business Transition Costs 
 The Company incurs certain costs related to acquisition, integration and business transition activities which include severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, third party merger and acquisitions costs and other costs directly associated with such activities. The Company incurred $3.5 million and $11.5 million of business transition costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily related to acquisition and integration activities.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $0.9 million and $10.8 million, respectively, of such costs, which included a $3.4 million charge associated with the resignation of the Company s   former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, which occurred in the first quarter 2015. The $3.4 million charge includes certain severance and compensation-related charges, net of certain forfeitures of previously recognized equity-based compe  nsation.  
 Included in business transition costs were the restructuring and impairment charges associated with the Company s exit of its New Jersey location and termination of the respective lease. The Company incurred charges of $0.5 million and $2.3 million associated with this activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the total recorded liability associated with this early lease termination was $2.9 million compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2015. The liability consists of future rental payments through 2017. The current portion of the liability is recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is recorded within other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented. 
 Product Shipment Costs 
 Product shipment costs, included in sales, marketing and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, were $5.7 million and $18.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $5.6 million and $15.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively. The majority of the Company s shipping costs are related to the loan of instrument sets, which are not sold as part of the Company s core sales offering.  Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in revenues and are not significant for any period presented. 
 Litigation Liability Gain (Loss) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company agreed to settle its ongoing litigation with Medtronic. As a result of the settlement, the Company paid $45.0 million to Medtronic and accordingly recorded a gain of $43.3 million related to the settlement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a litigation liability gain of $42.5 million resulting primarily from the recognition of a $56.4 million gain stemming from a favorable appeal in Phase 1 of the Medtronic litigation and a gain of $2.8 million in litigation accrual change related to the settlement of the NeuroVision trademark litigation, partially offset by litigation losses of $13.8 million in connection with the OIG investigation and $2.8 million in a general litigation matter. 
 See Note 11 and Note 12 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
     2.    Net Income Per Share 
 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per share attributable to the Company:

   Table of Contents   
   
 NUVASIVE, INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    The following weighted-average outstanding common stock equivalents were not included in the calculation of net income per diluted share because their effects were anti-dilutive:  

As discussed in Note 1 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the second quarter 2016, which requires any adjustments to be recorded as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The retrospective adjustments to the Company s financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 included a decrease in net loss attributable to the Company of $5.5 million, which resulted in a decrease in net loss per share of $0.11. The financial information in the table above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects this retrospective adjustment to the Company s financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2016. 
     3.    Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company maintains an investment policy that requires a diversified investment portfolio in terms of types, maturities, and credit exposure, and invests with institutions that have high credit quality. Annually, the Company reassesses the investment policy to ensure it is reflective of current markets and conditions. The Company does not currently hold financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
 The composition of marketable securities is as follows: 

11 
 
   Table of Contents   
   
 NUVASIVE, INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    As of September 30, 2016, the Company had liquidated its short-term and long-term marketable securities, and only held investments in secur  ities classified as cash equivalents. During the periods presented, the Company did not hold any investments that were in a significant unrealized loss position and no impairment charges were recorded. Realized gains and losses and interest income related   to marketable securities were immaterial during all periods presented.  
 Foreign Currency and Derivative Financial Instruments 
 The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. 
 Some of the Company s reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the point at which the transactions are originated until the settlement in cash. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses in the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains, which include gains and losses from derivative instruments, were $(0.1) million and $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and are included in other income (loss), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
 The Company maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect against fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may rise from volatility in currency exchange rates. The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the currency exchange rate exposure from short-term intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on forward contracts are included in the determination of net income as the forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting under  ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.  The foreign currency forward contracts effectively lock in the exchange rate at which the specific intercompany receivables and payables will be settled, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. The forward contracts are generally settled monthly.  A s of September 30, 2016 and  September 30, 2015  notional principal amount of $14.4 million and $ 16.8 million, respectively,  in foreign currency forward contracts was outstanding to hedge currency risk relative to the Company s foreign receivables and payables .

Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with authoritative guidance which requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. 
 Assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain assets or liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    The fair values of the Co  mpany s assets and liabilities, including cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted investments, derivatives, and contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and are determined under the fair value catego  ries in accordance with the authoritative guidance as follows:   

The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between the levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015, respectively. 
 The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments such as cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximate their related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of the Company s capital lease obligations approximate their related fair values as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 The fair value, based on a quoted market price (Level 1), of the Company s outstanding Senior Convertible Notes due 2017 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were approximately $197.1 million and $551.4 million, respectively. The fair value, based on a quoted market price (Level 1), of the Company s outstanding Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 was $822.0 million at September 30, 2016. See Note 6 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the carrying value of the Company s Senior Convertible Notes. 
 Contingent Consideration Liabilities 
 The following table sets forth the changes in the estimated fair value of the Company s liabilities measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):  

The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities assumed in business combinations is recorded as part of the purchase price consideration of the acquisition, and is determined using a discounted cash flow model or probability simulation model. The significant inputs of such models are not observable in the market, such as certain financial metric growth rates, volatility rates, projections associated with the applicable milestone, the interest rate, the related probabilities and payment structure in the contingent consideration arrangement. Fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities are recorded through operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Contingent consideration arrangements assumed by an asset purchase will be measured and accrued when such contingency is resolved.

    During the nine months   ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded additional contingent consideration liabilities of $63.4 million in connection with certain acquisitions. Such acquisitions include the acquisition in September 2016 of an imaging software and technology platf  orm known as Lessray       , which can be incorporated into the Company s MAS platform and forms a foundational element in the Company s imaging, navigation and automation platform development strategy, for which the Company recorded a preliminary purchase accou  nting fair value estimate for $36.0 million of contingent consideration liabilities, and acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2016 for which the Company recorded contingent consideration liabilities of $21.4 million as part of the purchase consid  eration for such acquisitions. At September 30, 2016, the contingent consideration liabilities were $65.4 million, and were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet commensurate with the respective payable terms. See Note 5 to the Unaudited Consolidated   Financial Statements for further discussion on contingent consideration liabilities assumed in business combinations.  
 Non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis 
 Certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, usually with Level 3 inputs including discounted cash flow method or cost method, on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with authoritative guidance. In general, non-financial assets, including intangible assets and property and equipment, are measured at fair value when there is an indication of impairment and are recorded at fair value only when any impairment is recognized. Any impairment charges recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were immaterial for the periods presented. 
   
   4.      Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill and intangible assets consisted of the following:

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with acquisitions and other investments, the Company recorded additions to definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill of $251.5 million and $343.6 million, respectiv  ely. Goodwill recorded in business combinations   is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition.   See Note 5 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on assets acquired in business combinations   and asset acquisitions.  
 The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying value of the Company s goodwill: 

Total expense related to the amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded in both cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $12.3 million and $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and $32.6 million and $11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
 Total future amortization expense related to intangible assets subject to amortization at September 30, 2016 is set forth in the table below:

        5.    Business Combinations  
 The Company recognizes the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest at fair value at the date of acquisition. Certain acquisitions contained contingent consideration arrangements that required the Company to assess the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities, which was recorded as part of the purchase consideration of the acquisition  with subsequent fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations commensurate with the nature of the contingent consideration.      
 Acquisition of Ellipse Technologies, Inc. 
 On  February 11 , 2016, the Company acquired all of the stock interest in Ellipse Technologies, Inc., which now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company under the renamed legal entity NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics, Inc. ( NSO ), for a purchase price of $380.0 million (including holdbacks for retained employment of Ellipse Technologies leadership that is to be expensed and is not considered part of the final purchase price) and a potential milestone payment of $30.0 million payable in cash in 2017 related to the achievement of a specific revenue target. If the revenue target is not achieved no payment will be due. A cash payment of $382.2 million, which included additional amounts for cash on hand and traditional working capital adjustments, was transferred at the closing. Subsequent to the closing payment, the Company received $0.6 million from the escrow for traditional working capital adjustments finalized after the closing.  
 NSO designs and sells expandable growing rod implant systems that can be non-invasively lengthened following implantation with precise, incremental adjustments via an external remote controller using magnetic technology called MAGnetic External Control, or MAGEC.  The technology platform provides the basis of NSO s core product offerings, including MAGEC-EOS, which allows for the minimally invasive treatment of early-onset and adolescent scoliosis, as well as the PRECICE limb lengthening system, which allows for the correction of long bone limb length discrepancy, as well as enhanced bone healing in patients that have experienced traumatic injury. 
 The Company applied certain assumptions and findings in the valuation outcome for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, for which the allocation of the purchase price is based on their fair values, as follows: 

Goodwill recognized in this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill largely consists of expected revenue synergies resulting from the combination of product portfolios, cost synergies related to  elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the Company s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of NSO s products;  and the assembled workforce. The intangible assets acquired will be amortized on a straight-line basis over weighted-average useful lives of seven years, nine years and seven years for technology-based, customer-related intangible assets, and trade name related intangible assets, respectively. The estimated fair values of the intangible assets acquired were primarily determined using the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable.

    In connection with the acquisition, a contingent liability of $18.8 million was recorded as of March 31, 2016 for the potential revenue-based milestone payment. The liability was fair valued u  sing the Monte Carlo simulation based on specific revenue achievement scenarios and discount factors. Changes in fair value of the liability over the measurement period are recorded in the results of operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   The fair value of the liability at September 30, 2016 was $21.6 million and recorded in current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 Acquisition costs of $4.0 million were recognized as selling, marketing and administrative expenses as incurred. The Company s results of operations included the operating results of NSO, since the date of acquisition, of $15.0 million and $35.8 million of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and net income of $0.9 million and $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 The following table presents the unaudited pro forma results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information combines the results of operations of NuVasive and Ellipse Technologies as though the companies had been combined as of January 1, 2015, and the pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at such times. The unaudited pro forma results presented include non-recurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination, some of which are presented in the comparable period results instead of the current period by nature of such adjustments. The adjustments for amortization charges for acquired intangible assets were $6.5 million and $19.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,  respectively .  The adjustments to cost of sales for increased fair value of acquired inventory of $(14.7) million and $14.7 million for the nine months ended  September  30, 2016 and  September 30, 2015, respectively,  were only applicable to the  nine months ended periods presented. The nine month period 2015 also includes an adjustment of $4.0 million for  acquisition related expenses. All periods presented include   immaterial adjustments to revenue for deferred revenue adjustments,  and related tax effects to the pre-tax income. The pre-acquisition accounting policies of Ellipse Technologies were materially similar to the Company, with the differences adjusted to reflect the accounting policies of the Company in the unaudited pro forma results presented. 

Other Acquisitions 
 On  July 1 , 2016, the Company acquired all of the stock interest in BNN Holdings Corp., for a purchase price of $98.0 million.  BNN Holdings Corp., through its subsidiaries and affiliates, owns and operates Biotronic NeuroNetwork, a patient-centric healthcare organization that provides intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring services to surgeons and healthcare facilities across the U.S.  A cash payment of $94.0 million was transferred at the closing, which represented the total purchase consideration, net of amounts retained for certain acquired provisional obligations, additional amounts for cash on hand and traditional working capital adjustments. The acquisition was not considered material to the overall Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Company combined the service offerings of  Biotronic NeuroNetwork with its Impulse Monitoring, Inc. business under the newly created division NuVasive Clinical Services ( NCS ).   
 The Company has completed other acquisitions that were not considered material to the overall Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements during the periods presented. These acquisitions have been included in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements from the respective dates of acquisition. The Company does not believe that collectively the acquisitions made during the year, excluding NSO, are material to the overall financial statements. 
 For certain acquisitions completed during the nine months ended September 2016, the Company is still in the process of finalizing the purchase price allocation given the timing of the acquisition and the size and scope of the assets and liabilities subject to valuation. While the Company does not expect material changes in the valuation outcome, certain assumptions and findings that were in place at the date of acquisition could result in changes in the purchase price allocation. The Company anticipates finalizing the purchase price allocation in the fourth quarter of 2016.

    Variable Interest Entities  
 Progentix Orthobiology B.V. 
 In 2009, the Company completed the purchase of 40% of the capital stock of Progentix   Orthobiology B.V. ( Progentix ), a company organized under the laws of the Netherlands, from existing shareholders (the  Progentix Shareholders ) pursuant to a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement for $10.0 million in cash (the  Initial Investment ). As of September 30, 2016, the Company has loaned Progentix cumulatively $5.3 million at an interest rate of 6% per year. The Company is not obligated to provide additional funding. Concurrently, with the Initial Investment, the Company and Progentix entered into a Distribution Agreement (as amended, the  Distribution Agreement ), whereby Progentix appointed the Company as its exclusive distributor for certain Progentix products. The Distribution Agreement is in effect for a term of ten years unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. 
 In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company has determined that Progentix is a variable interest entity ( VIE ), as it does not have the ability to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and its equity investors will not absorb their proportionate share of expected losses and will be limited in the receipt of the potential residual returns of Progentix.  
 Total assets and liabilities of Progentix included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:

Impulse Monitoring, Inc. and Physician Practices 
 The Company maintains contractual relationships with several physician practices ( PCs ) which were inherited through the 2011 acquisition of Impulse Monitoring, Inc. and the 2016 acquisition of BNN Holdings Corp. In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company has determined that the PCs are VIEs and the therefore, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the PCs from the date of acquisition. During the periods presented, the result of PCs was immaterial to the Company s financials. The creditors of the PCs have claims only on the assets of the PCs, which are not material, and the assets of the PCs are not available to the Company.

 The carrying values of the Company s Senior Convertible Notes are as follows: 

2.25% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 
 In March 2016, the Company issued $650.0 million principal amount of unsecured Senior Convertible Notes with a stated interest rate of 2.25% and a maturity date of March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Notes"). The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and costs directly related to the offering, were approximately $634.1 million. The 2021 Notes may be settled in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, solely at the Company's discretion. It is the Company's current intent and policy to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves satisfying the principal amount outstanding with cash and any note conversion value over the principal amount in shares of the Company's common stock. The initial conversion rate of the 2021 Notes is 16.7158 shares per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $59.82 per share, subject to adjustments. The Company uses the treasury share method for assumed conversion of the 2021 Notes to compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share. The Company also entered into transactions for convertible note hedge (the "2021 Hedge") and warrants (the "2021 Warrants") concurrently with the issuance of the 2021 Notes. 
 The cash conversion feature of the 2021 Notes required bifurcation from the Notes and was initially accounted for as an equity instrument classified to stockholders  equity, which resulted in recognizing $84.8 million in additional paid-in-capital during 2016.  
 The interest expense recognized on the 2021 Notes during the three months ended  September 30, 2016  includes $3.7 million, $3.8 million and $0.6 million for the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount and the amortization of the debt issuance costs, respectively. The interest expense recognized on the 2021 Notes during the nine months ended  September  30, 2016 includes $7.9 million, $8.2 million and $1.3 million for the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount and the amortization of the debt issuance costs, respectively. The effective interest rate on the 2021 Notes is 5.8%, which includes the interest on the notes, amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs. Interest on the 2021 Notes began accruing upon issuance and is payable semi-annually.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   
    Prior to September 15, 2020, holders may convert their 2021 Notes only under the following conditions: (a) during an  y calendar quarter beginning June 30, 2016, if the reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 days out of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130% o  f the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (b) during the five business day period in which the trading price of the 2021 Notes falls below 98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and (ii) the conver  sion rate on that date; and (c) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the 2021 Notes. From September 15, 2020 and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 15, 2021, holders may c  onvert their 2021 Notes at any time (regardless of the foregoing circumstances).   The Company may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to March 20, 2019. The Company may redeem the 2021 Notes, at its option, in whole or in part on or after March 20, 2019 until t  he close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2020 if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecu  tive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company delivers written notice of a redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2021 Notes to be redee  med plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date  . No principal payments are due on the 2021 Notes prior to maturity. Other than restrictions relating to certain fundamental changes and consolidations, mergers or asset sales and c  ustomary anti-dilution adjustments, the 2021 Notes do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company from paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing any of its other securities. The Company is unaware of any current events or market c  onditions that would allow holders to convert the 2021 Notes.  
 2021 Hedge 
 In connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the Company entered into the hedge transaction with the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates (the "2021 Counterparties") entitling the Company to purchase up to 10,865,270 shares of the Company's common stock at an initial stock price of $59.82 per share, each of which is subject to adjustment. The cost of the 2021 Hedge was $111.2 million and accounted for as an equity instrument by recognizing $111.2 million in additional paid-in-capital during 2016. The 2021 Hedge will expire on March 15, 2021. The 2021 Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2021 Notes if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock exceeds the strike price of the 2021 Hedge. An assumed exercise of the 2021 Hedge by the Company is considered anti-dilutive since the effect of the inclusion would always be anti-dilutive with respect to the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
 2021 Warrants 
 The Company sold warrants to the 2021 Counterparties to acquire up to 10,865,270 shares of the Company s common stock. The 2021 Warrants will expire on various dates from June 2021 through December 2021 and may be settled in cash or net shares. It is the Company's current intent and policy to settle all conversions in shares of the Company s common stock. The Company received $44.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2021 Warrants, which was recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The 2021 Warrants could have a dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company's common stock during a given measurement period exceeds the strike price of the 2021 Warrants, which is $80.00 per share. The Company uses the treasury share method for assumed conversion of its 2021 Warrants to compute the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share. 
 2.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017 
 In June 2011, the Company issued  $402.5 million  principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes with a stated interest rate of  2.75%  and a maturity date of  July 1, 2017  (the  2017 Notes ). The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers  discounts and costs directly related to the offering, were approximately  $359.2 million . The 2017 Notes may be settled in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, solely at the Company s discretion. It is the Company s current intent and policy to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves satisfying the principal amount outstanding with cash and any note conversion value over the principal amount in shares of the Company s common stock. The initial conversion rate of the 2017 Notes is  23.7344  shares per  $1,000  principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately  $42.13  per share, subject to adjustments. The Company uses the treasury share method for assumed conversion of the 2017 Notes to compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share. The Company also entered into transactions for convertible note hedge (the  2017 Hedge ) and warrants (the  2017 Warrants ) concurrently with the issuance of the 2017 Notes. In March 2016, the Company used approximately $345.2 million of the net proceeds from the 2021 Notes offering to repurchase approximately $276.8 million in principal amount outstanding of the $402.5 million 2017 Notes. The repurchase of a portion of the 2017 Notes resulted in a remaining balance of $125.7 million principal amount outstanding.

    The cash conversion feature of the 2017 Notes required bifurcation from the Notes and was initially accounted for as a derivative liability and debt discount of $88.9 million upon issuance of the Notes withou  t authorization of issuing additional common stocks for the conversion.  Upon obtaining stockholder approval for the additional authorized shares of the Company s common stock, the derivative liability was reclassified to stockholders  equity, which result  ed in recognizing cumulatively $39.5 million in other income for change in fair value measurement and $49.4 million in additional paid-in-capital during 2011.   
 The interest expense recognized on the 2017 Notes during the three months  September 30, 2016  includes $0.9 million, $1.3 million and $0.2 million for the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount and the amortization of debt issuance costs, respectively.  The interest expense recognized on the 2017 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $4.2 million, $6.3 million and $0.9 million for the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount and the amortization of the debt issuance costs, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, interest expense recognized on the 2017 Notes includes $2.8 million, $4.0 million and $0.5 million for the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount, and the amortization of the debt issuance costs, respectively.  The interest expense recognized on the 2017 Notes during the nine months ended  September  30, 2015 includes $8.3 million, $11.7 million and $1.5 million for the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount and the amortization of debt issuance costs, respectively. The effective interest rate on the 2017 Notes is 8.0%, which includes the interest on the notes, amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs. Interest on the 2017 Notes began accruing upon issuance and is payable semi-annually. 
 Prior to January 1, 2017, holders may convert their 2017 Notes only under the following conditions: (a) during any calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2011, if the reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least  20  days out of  30  consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than  130%  of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (b) during the  five  business day period in which the trading price of the 2017 Notes falls below  98%  of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date; and (c) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the 2017 Notes. From January 1, 2017 and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding July 1, 2017, holders may convert their 2017 Notes at any time (regardless of the foregoing circumstances). The Company may not redeem the 2017 Notes prior to maturity. Other than restrictions relating to certain fundamental changes and consolidations, mergers or asset sales and customary anti-dilution adjustments, the 2017 Notes do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company from paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing any of its other securities. At September 30, 2016, holders of the 2017 Notes were in a convertible position, as the reported sale price of the Company s common stock for 20 days out of the last 30 consecutive trading days ending with September 30, 2016 exceeded 130% of the $42.13 per share conversion price on each applicable trading day. At September 30, 2016, a minimal amount of holders of the 2017 Notes had elected to convert their notes. The Company will settle such conversions in the fourth quarter 2016 through the combination settlement described above. The 2017 Notes are recorded as current liabilities on the September 30, 2016 consolidated balance sheet. 
 2017 Hedge 
 In connection with the offering of the 2017 Notes, the Company entered into the 2017 Hedge with the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates (the  2017 Counterparties ) entitling the Company to purchase up to  9,553,096  shares of the Company s common stock at an initial stock price of  $42.13  per share, each of which is subject to adjustment. The cost of the 2017 Hedge was  $80.1 million and accounted for as derivative assets upon issuance of the 2017 Notes . Upon obtaining stockholder approval for the additional authorized shares of the Company s common stock, the derivative asset was reclassified to stockholders  equity, which resulted in recognizing cumulatively $37.1 million in other expense for the change in fair value measurement and $43.0 million in  additional paid-in-capital  during 2011. The 2017 Hedge will expire on July 1, 2017. The 2017 Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2017 Notes if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds the strike price of the 2017 Hedge. An assumed exercise of the 2017 Hedge by the Company is considered anti-dilutive since the  effect of inclusion would always be anti-dilutive with respect to the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

 The Company sold warrants to the 2017 Counterparties to acquire up to  477,654  shares of the Company s Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an initial strike price of  $988.51  per share, subject to adjustment. Each share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock is convertible into  20  shares of the Company s common stock, or up to 9,553,080 common shares in total. The 2017 Warrants will expire on various dates from September 2017 through January 2018 and may be settled in cash or net shares. It is the Company s current intent and policy to settle all conversions in shares of the Company s common stock. The Company received  $47.9 million  in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2017 Warrants, which was recorded in  additional paid-in-capital . The 2017 Warrants could have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company s common stock during a given measurement period exceeds the strike price of the 2017 Warrants. The Company uses the treasury share method for assumed conversion of its 2017 Warrants to compute the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share.

    Repurchases of Senior Convertible Notes due 2017  
 In March 2016, the Company used approximately $345.2 million of the net proceeds from the 2021 Notes offering to repurchase approximately $276.8 million principal amount outstanding of the $402.5 million principal Senior Convertible Notes due 2017, the associated conversion feature of the repurchased notes (which is recorded in additional paid-in capital), and the accrued interest on the repurchased notes. As a result of this repurchase, the Company recorded a loss in other expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended  September  30, 2016 of approximately $17.4 million for the early extinguishment of 2017 Notes and the related debt issuance costs that were previously capitalized in connection with the issuance of the 2017 Notes. The repurchase of a portion of the 2017 Notes resulted in remaining balances of $125.7 million, $6.8 million, and $1.0 million of principal outstanding, debt discount, and debt issuance costs, respectively, at the time of the repurchase.  The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2021 Notes offering for general corporate purposes.  
 Revolving Senior Credit Facility 
 In February 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) for a revolving senior credit facility (the  Facility ) that provides for secured revolving loans, multicurrency loan options and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement also contains an expansion feature, which allows the Company to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Facility provided the Company remains in compliance with the underlying financial covenants. The Facility matures February 8, 2021,  and includes a sub-limit of $15.0 million for letters of credit and a sub-limit of $5.0 million for swing line loans. All assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the Facility (subject to customary exceptions) pursuant to the term set forth in the Security and Pledge Agreement (the  Security Agreement ) executed in favor of the administrative agent by the Company. Each of the Company s material domestic subsidiaries guarantees the Facility.    At September 30, 2016 the Company does not carry any outstanding revolving loans under the Facility. 
 Borrowings under the Facility are used by us to provide financing for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potential mergers and acquisitions. Loans under the Facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, at either LIBOR (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00 % - 2.00 % per annum subject to Company s applicable consolidated leverage ratio or the Base Rate (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.0% - 1.25% per annum subject to Company s applicable consolidated leverage ratio. The Facility has a commitment fee, which accrues at a rate of 0.2% - 0.4% per annum (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) based on the Company s current leverage ratio. 
 The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants require the Company to maintain ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in relation to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt, respectively, as defined in the Credit Agreement, at varying scales throughout the life of the Credit Agreement. The Facility grants the lenders preferred first priority liens and security interests in capital stock, intercompany debt and all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and each guarantor.

        7.   Stock-Based Compensation  
 The compensation cost that has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all stock-based compensation arrangements was as follows:  

At September 30, 2016, there was $55.1 million of unamortized compensation expense for restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs ) to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. 
 Stock Options and Purchase Rights 
 The weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) are as follows: 

Under the terms of the  ESPP, shareowners can elect to have up to 15% of their annual compensation, up to a maximum of $21,250 per year, withheld to purchase shares of the Company s common stock for a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share (at closing) of the Company s common stock on (i) the commencement date of the two-year or six-month offering period (depending on the purchase period enrolled), or (ii) the respective purchase date.  
 The Company has not granted any options since 2011. The Company issued approximately 0.1 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock, before net share settlement, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and issued approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 The Company issued approximately 0.1 million and 0.8 million shares of common stock, before net share settlement, upon vesting of RSUs (including PRSUs) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and issued approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock in settlement of RSUs (including PRSUs) upon their vesting during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Assumed Equity Incentive Plan 
 In connection with the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies in February 2016 (see Note 5 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company assumed the Ellipse Technologies, Inc. 2015 Incentive Award Plan and the shares thereunder, subject to an equity exchange adjustment, for future awards by the Company.

        8.    Income Taxes  
 Income taxes are determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate applied against income, and then adjusted for the tax impacts of certain significant and discrete items. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company treated the tax impact of the following as discrete events for which the tax effect was recognized separately from the application of the annual effective tax rate: tax benefits related to excess share-based payment in income tax expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016, changes to the beginning of the year valuation allowances and certain unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 1 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the adoption of ASU 2016-09. The Company s effective tax rate recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 37%. 
 In accordance with the disclosure requirements as described in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits as non-current income tax liabilities, or a reduction in deferred tax assets, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company s continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $7.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to research and development credits and costs incurred in the acquisition and integration of acquired entities. The Company does not anticipate there will be a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 
 The Company is subject to routine compliance reviews on various tax matters around the world in the ordinary course of business. Currently, income tax audits are being conducted in the state of New York and the state of Louisiana. U.S. and most foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination in all years due to prior year net operating losses and R D credits. 
     9.    Business Segment, Product and Geographic Information 
 The Company operates in one segment based upon the Company s organizational structure, the way in which the operations are managed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker and the lack of availability of discrete financial information. 
 The Company operates under two distinct product lines; spinal hardware and surgical support. The Company s spinal hardware product line offerings include implants and fixation products, and following the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies, also include the MAGEC- EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system and the PRECICE limb lengthening system. The Company s surgical support product offerings include IOM services, disposables and biologics, all of which are used to aid spinal surgery. Revenue by product line was as follows: 

Revenue and property and equipment, net, by geographic area were as follows:

        10.      Commitments  
 Licensing and Purchasing Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has obligations under certain consultancy arrangements to pay up to approximately $18.6 million in the aggregate in the event that specified revenue-based milestones are achieved prior to 2024.  Any such payment will be made in a combination of cash and the Company s common shares as provided in the agreements.  Any payments in satisfaction of theses contingent obligations are considered a cost of goods sold and are recognized as and if milestones are achieved. These agreements  expire on various dates through 2024.   
 Executive Severance Plans    
 The Company has employment contracts with key executives and maintains severance plans that provide for the payment of severance and other benefits if terminated for reasons other than cause, as defined in those agreements and plans. Certain agreements call for payments that are based on historical compensation, accordingly, the amount of the contractual commitment will change over time commensurate with the executive s applicable earnings. At September 30, 2016, future commitments for such key executives were approximately $26.2 million. In certain circumstances, the agreements call for the acceleration of equity vesting. Those figures are not reflected in the above information. 
 Leasing Commitments Assumed in Business Combinations 
   In connection with the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies in February 2016, (see Note 5 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the acquisition) the Company assumed the operating leases to its office facilities. The leases were determined to be of similar terms that would be expected to be provided to the Company had it entered into the leasing agreements independently.  In connection with the operating leases, the Company acquired the security deposits recorded   and maintained as restricted cash which total $1.5 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s future lease payment commitments associated with the assumed operating leases total $6.6 million through the terms of the leases.  
 The terms of the leases assumed extend through 2020, and g enerally provide for periodic rent increases. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Accordingly, rent expense recognized in excess of rent paid is reflected as a liability in the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
 Additionally, the Company assumed leasing commitments  in its other business combinations for which the business combinations and assumed leasing commitments i ndividually and collectively were not  considered material  to the overall Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     11.    Contingencies 
 The Company is subject to potential liabilities under government regulations and various claims and legal actions that are pending or may be asserted from time-to-time. These matters arise in the ordinary course and conduct of the Company s business and include, for example, commercial, intellectual property, environmental, securities and employment matters. The Company intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in such matters. Furthermore, the Company regularly assesses contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in its financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company agreed to settle its ongoing litigation with Medtronic. As a result of the settlement, the Company paid $45.0 million to Medtronic and accordingly recorded a gain of $43.3 million related to the settlement by reducing its previous accrual of $88.3 million related to the matter. 
 In the first quarter of 2015 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a gain of $56.4 million related to a litigation accrual change resulting from the legal proceedings in Phase 1 of the Medtronic litigation whereby the damages award by the jury was overturned, and a gain of $2.8 million in litigation accrual change related to settlement of the NeuroVision trademark litigation. This amount was offset by a litigation charge of $13.8 million related to the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) investigation and a $3.3 million litigation charge in a general litigation matter. Refer to both the subsequent sections herein titled  Legal Proceedings  and to Note 12 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

    An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company s financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the   loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on the Company s assessment, it has adequately accrued an amount for contingent liabilities currently in existence. The Company does not accrue amounts for liabilities that it does not believe are probable or that i  t considers immaterial to its overall financial position. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur. As a result, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. The amount of ul  timate loss may exceed the Company s current accruals, and it is possible that its cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.  
 Legal Proceedings 
 Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc. Litigation 
 In August 2008, Warsaw Orthopedic, Inc., Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc. and other Medtronic related entities (collectively,  Medtronic ) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the  Medtronic Litigation ), alleging that certain of the Company s products or methods, including the XLIF    procedure, infringe, or contribute to the infringement of,  twelve  U.S. patents assigned or licensed to Medtronic.  Three  of the patents were later withdrawn by Medtronic, leaving  nine  purportedly infringed patents. The Company brought counterclaims against Medtronic alleging infringement of certain of the Company s patents.  
 The case was administratively broken into several phases.  
 The first phase ( Phase 1 ) of the case included  three  Medtronic patents and  one  Company patent. The initial trial on the first phase of the case concluded on September 20, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, and a jury delivered an unfavorable verdict against the Company with respect to the  three  Medtronic patents and a favorable verdict with respect to the  one  Company patent at issue, including a monetary damages award of approximately  $101.2 million  to Medtronic (the  2011 verdict ). Medtronic s subsequent motion for a permanent injunction was denied by the District Court. On May 15, 2013, the District Court granted the parties  joint motion to dismiss claims relating to one of the three Medtronic patents pursuant to a settlement agreement, leaving two Medtronic patents remaining in the litigation. On June 11, 2013, the District Court granted the parties ongoing royalties with respect to the two Medtronic patents and the one Company patent remaining in the first phase of the case (the  June 2013 ruling ).  
 Both parties filed appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March 2, 2015, the Court of Appeals issued a decision upholding the jury s findings of liability as to all patents, but overturning the damage award against the Company as improper ( March 2 nd  Court of Appeals Decision ). The case was remanded back to the District Court for further proceedings and a retrial to determine a proper damages award. Similarly, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Medtronic s appeal of liability with regard to the one Company patent at issue in Phase 1, and remanded the case back to the Court of Appeals for further consideration of Medtronic s liability in view of an intervening case from the Supreme Court. On June 3, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed Medtronic s liability regarding the one Company patent. Further, on March 6, 2015, the Company sought reexamination of certain claims of one of the two Medtronic patents at issue in Phase 1 of the litigation and for which the Company was found to have infringed. On June 15, 2016, the District Court stayed the Phase 1 remand proceedings and retrial pending the reexamination. As of September 30, 2016, the claims of the Medtronic patent subject to reexamination stand rejected pursuant to a June 17, 2016 non-final office action. 
 As a result of the affirmation of the infringement and remand for a new trial on damages, the Company assessed the existing liability under the loss contingency framework and   in accordance with applicable accounting guidance   believed the most appropriate accrual estimate within the possible range dictated by such guidance was $87.6 million. This amount represents liability for the infringement of the two Medtronic patents for infringing products at historically supplied rates from the date of infringement to the current period. The liability did not include an accrual for lost profits or convoyed products. A liability associated with this matter has been recorded in non-current litigation liabilities. In prior periods, the Company recorded the respective liabilities (as estimated) in non-current litigation liabilities and the accrued royalties in accrued liabilities. The Company did not agree with the previously-ruled royalty rates, and intended to rigorously pursue appropriate rates during the new trial on damages. Nonetheless, in the interim, the Company applied the previously-ruled royalty rates when calculating the appropriate estimate. As a result of the adjustment, the Company recorded an adjustment of $56.4 million as a gain in its Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter 2015.

    On March 19, 2012, in connection with these proceedings, the Company entered into an escrow arrangement and transferred   $113.3 million   of cash into a restricted escrow account to secure the amount of judgment, plus prejudgment i  nterest, during pendency of the appeal. As a result of the March 2   nd    Court of Appeals Decision, the parties agreed to release all of the escrow funds related to this matter back to the Company. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company   transferred all of the funds in escrow related to this matter, approximately $114.1 million, from long-term restricted cash and investments into its unrestricted investment accounts.  
 In accordance with the authoritative guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, during the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded an accrual of  $101.2 million  for the 2011 verdict. In addition, the Company accrued royalties at the royalty rates stated in the 2011 verdict on sales subsequent to the 2011 verdict and through March 31, 2013. After the June 2013 ruling, the Company (i) began accruing ongoing royalties on sales at the royalty rates stated in the June 2013 ruling, and (ii) recorded a charge of approximately  $7.9 million  to account for the difference between using the royalty rates stated in the 2011 verdict and those in the June 2013 ruling on sales through March 31, 2013. Based on the June 2013 ruling, the Company agreed to escrow funds to secure accrued royalties as well as future ongoing royalties. However, in light of the March 2 nd  Court of Appeals Decision, escrowed funds were released to the Company. Additionally, the Company modified its accrual from the 2011 verdict as a result of the March 2 nd  Court of Appeals Decision as previously discussed. 
 With respect to the favorable verdict delivered regarding the one Company patent litigated to verdict, the jury awarded the Company monetary damages of approximately  $0.7 million  for reasonable royalty damages. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on the evaluation of gain contingencies, this amount was not recorded at September 30, 2016. Additionally, the June 2013 ruling determined the ongoing royalty rate to be paid to the Company by Medtronic for its post-verdict sales of the one Company patent. Consistent with the treatment afforded the  $0.7 million  damage award, no amount was recorded for royalty revenue as of September 30, 2016. 
 The second phase of the case involved one Medtronic cervical plate patent. On April 25, 2013, the Company and Medtronic entered into a settlement agreement fully resolving the second phase of the case ( 2013 Settlement ). The settlement also removed from the case the cervical plate patent that was part of the first phase. As part of the settlement, the Company received a broad license to practice (i) the Medtronic patent that was the sole subject of the second phase of the litigation, (ii) the Medtronic cervical plate patent that was part of the first phase of the litigation, and (iii) each of the Medtronic patent families that collectively represent the vast majority of Medtronic s patent rights related to cervical plate technology. In exchange for these license rights, the Company made a one-time payment to Medtronic of  $7.5 million.  In addition, Medtronic will receive a royalty on certain cervical plate products sold by the Company, including the Helix and Gradient lines of products. As a result of this settlement, all current patent disputes between the parties related to cervical plate technology have been resolved. 
 In August 2012, Medtronic filed additional patent claims in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana alleging that various Company spinal implants (including its CoRoent XL family of spinal implants) infringe Medtronic s U.S. Patent No. 8,021,430, that the Company s Osteocel Plus bone graft product infringes Medtronic s U.S. Patent No. 5,676,146, ( 146 Patent ) and that the Company s XLIF procedure and use of MaXcess IV retractor during the XLIF procedure infringe methodology claims of Medtronic s U.S. Patent No. 8,251,997. The case, which is referred to herein as the third phase of the Medtronic litigation, was later transferred to the Southern District of California, and, on March 7, 2013, the Company counterclaimed alleging infringement by Medtronic of the Company s U.S. Patent Nos. 8,000,782 (systems and related methods for performing surgical procedures), 8,005,535 (systems and related methods for performing surgical procedures), 8,016,767 (a surgical access system including a tissue distraction assembly and a tissue retraction assembly), 8,192,356 (a system for accessing a surgical target site and related methods, involving an initial distraction system, among other things), 8,187,334 (spinal fusion implant), 8,361,156 (spinal fusion implant), D652,922 (dilator design) ( 922 Patent ), and D666,294 (dilator design). On July 25, 2013, Medtronic amended its complaint to add a charge of infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 8,444,696. The District Court stayed litigation of a number of Medtronic and Company patents subjected to reexamination or review proceedings conducted by the Patent Office. Both parties brought motions for summary judgment addressing the patents that were not stayed or dismissed in the litigation, and summary judgment of non-infringement was granted as to both remaining patents on October 20, 2015 and February 17, 2016, respectively. No other patent claims are active in the third phase of the case. Before September 30, 2016, the probable outcome of this litigation could not be determined, nor could the Company estimate a range of potential loss. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, the Company did not record an accrual related to this litigation.

    On July 13, 2016, the   Company entered into a settlement and patent license agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with Medtronic to settle the Medtronic Litigation. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company paid Medtronic $45.0 million, and the parties released e  ach other from, inter alia, any and all past patent infringement arising from the Medtronic Litigation. As a result, the Company adjusted its litigation accrual from $88.3 million to $45.0 million and recorded   a $43.3 million gain in the Consolidated State  ment of Operations for the nine months ended   September   30, 2016.     Associated with the gain on the litigation are certain service provider fees, the Company has recorded its obligations associated with the gain, however, it is reasonably possible the Company   s estimates could differ from those that have been recorded in the financial statements  . Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties granted each other irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, paid-up, royalty-free licenses to practice certain of their   respective patents as to certain of their respective existing product lines, subject to specified exceptions and limitations. The Settlement Agreement also provides that, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, and for a period of seven years, neit  her party will assert against the other certain claims for patent infringement (generally claims related to spinal implants and related instruments, biologics and neuromonitoring) other than through a specified dispute resolution process, with the right to   thereafter pursue claims outside that process subject to certain limitations and exceptions. Further, Medtronic has agreed that, for a period of five years, and subject to limitations and exceptions, it will not assert against the Company certain other cl  aims for patent infringement other than through a specified dispute resolution process, with the right to thereafter pursue claims outside that process subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  
 Trademark Infringement Litigation  
 On September 25, 2009, Neurovision Medical Products, Inc. ( NMP ) filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 2:09-cv-06988-R-JEM) alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. NMP sought cancellation of NuVasive s  NeuroVision  trademark registrations, injunctive relief and damages based on NMP s common law use of the  NeuroVision  mark. The matter was tried in October 2010 and an unfavorable jury verdict was delivered against the Company. The verdict awarded damages to NMP of $60.0 million, and the Company appealed the judgment. The Court of Appeals reversed and vacated the judgment, and a new trial was conducted in the District Court. In April 2014, a jury returned a verdict in favor of NMP on its claims against the Company in the amount of $30.0 million. The District Court also entered an order canceling the Company s NeuroVision trademark registrations. In July 2015, the Company agreed to settle all outstanding matters with NMP for $27.2 million. The Company adjusted its litigation accrual from $30.0 million to $27.2 million at June 30, 2015, which resulted in  a $2.8 million gain which was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The Company previously escrowed funds totaling $32.5 million to secure the amount of judgment, and cover potential attorney s fees and costs. Those funds accrued interest and were included in short-term restricted cash and investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until funding of the settlement which occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company no longer has any remaining liability or restricted cash related to this matter.  
 Securities Litigation  
 On August 28, 2013, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California naming the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers for allegedly making false and materially misleading statements regarding the Company s business and financial results, specifically relating to the purported improper submission of false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. The operative complaint asserts a putative class period stemming from October 22, 2008 to July 30, 2013. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and seeks unspecified monetary relief, interest, and attorneys  fees. On February 13, 2014, Brad Mauss, the lead plaintiff in the case ( Plaintiff ), filed an Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws. The District Court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint and ordered Plaintiff to amend the complaint. Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on September 8, 2014, and the District Court once again granted the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint with leave to amend. On December 23, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss, and while the Company s motion was pending, Plaintiff sought leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. The Company moved to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint. On August 28, 2015, the District Court issued an order granting the Company s motion to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint with leave to amend. On September 11, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Fifth Amended Complaint, and in July 2016, the District Court issued an order rejecting the Company s motion to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint. The Company answered the Fifth Amended Complaint on August 25, 2016 and discovery is proceeding.  Trial has been set for December 18, 2017. At September 30, 2016, the probable outcome of this litigation cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss. In accordance with authoritative guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, the Company has not recorded an accrual related to this litigation.

The derivative complaint is based upon the same factual allegations as the securities class action litigation and names the Company as a nominal defendant.  The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint. At September 30, 2016, the probable outcome of this litigation cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss. In accordance with authoritative guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, the Company has not recorded an accrual related to this litigation. 
 Madsen Medical, Inc. Litigation 
  On February 22, 2016, an unfavorable jury verdict was delivered against the Company in its litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against Madsen Medical, Inc. ( MMI ), a former sales agent. Specifically, the jury awarded MMI $7.5 million in lost profits for tortious interference, $14.0 million for unjust enrichment, $20.0 million in punitive damages, and approximately $0.3 million in damages for breach of contract.  On March 18, 2016, t he trial court entered judgment in favor of MMI in the amount of $27.8 million, which amount excluded the $14.0 million disgorgement awarded by the jury. On July 5, 2016, the trial court also awarded MMI attorney s fees and costs of approximately $1.1 million. The Company s post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and/or for a new trial were denied, and the Company has filed a notice of appeal of both the verdict and the court s subsequent award of attorney s fees and costs. During pendency of any appeals, the Company has secured a bond to cover the amount of the judgment and attorneys  fees and costs.   
  Historically the Company had believed the likelihood of a loss in this case was remote given the underlying facts of the case, however, during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the judgment entered caused the Company to reassess its position.  The Company, based on its own assessment as well as that of outside counsel, believes that upon either post-trial motions or appeal the judgment will be vacated and have deemed it probable that is the outcome. The Company continues to believe that the judgment will be vacated, and accordingly, at  September  30, 2016, the Company believes that the outcome of the case does not constitute a probable nor an estimable loss associated with the litigation but rather a reasonably possible loss rather than a remote loss as historically contemplated.  Therefore, the Company has not recorded a loss contingency but has assessed a reasonable range of potential loss, which would be from zero to the current amount entered as a judgment, as well as attorney s fees and interest, in accordance with the accounting guidance required by ASC 450, Contingencies.  
     12.    Regulatory Matters 
 In 2013, the Company received a federal administrative subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) in connection with an investigation into possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. The subpoena sought discovery of documents for the period January 2007 through April 2013. In July 2015, the Company entered into a definitive settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid $13.5 million plus fees and accrued interest of approximately $0.3 million to resolve this matter. The settlement was not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, and the Company was not required to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG as part of the settlement. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, the Company recorded a $13.8 million litigation charge related to this matter, which was included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and funded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 On August 31, 2015, the Company received a civil investigative demand ( CID ) issued by the DOJ pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. The CID requires the delivery of a wide range of documents and information related to an investigation by the DOJ concerning allegations that the Company assisted a physician group customer in submitting improper claims for reimbursement and made improper payments to the physician group in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Company is cooperating with the DOJ. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this investigation. At September 30, 2016, the probable outcome of this matter cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss. In accordance with authoritative guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, the Company has not recorded an accrual related to this matter.

Overview  
 We are a leading medical device company in the global spine surgery market, focused on developing minimally-disruptive surgical products and procedurally-integrated solutions for spine surgery. Our currently-marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery, including corrective spinal alignment and other surgical support and services used to aid in spine surgery procedures. 
 Our principal product offering includes a minimally-disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS. The MAS platform combines three categories of solutions that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during spine fusion surgery, provide maximum visualization and are designed to enable safe and reproducible outcomes for the surgeon and the patient. The platform includes our proprietary software-driven nerve detection and avoidance systems, and Intraoperative Monitoring, or IOM, services and support; MaXcess, an integrated split-blade retractor system; and a wide variety of specialized implants and biologics. Many of our products, including the individual components of our MAS platform can also be used in open or traditional spine surgery. Our spine surgery product line offerings, which include products for the thoracolumbar and the cervical spine, are primarily used to enable surgeon access to the spine to perform restorative and fusion procedures in a minimally-disruptive fashion. We also recently launched Integrated Global Alignment, or iGA, in which products and computer assisted technology under our MAS platform help achieve more precise spinal alignment. Our biologics products, which are used to aid in the spinal fusion process or bone healing process, include allograft (donated human tissue) and synthetic offerings. 
 In addition, on February 11, 2016 we acquired Ellipse Technologies, Inc., or Ellipse Technologies, which now operates as our wholly owned subsidiary under the renamed legal entity NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics, Inc., or NSO. NSO designs and sells expandable growing rod implant systems that can be non-invasively lengthening following implantation with precise, incremental adjustments via an external remote controller using magnetic technology called MAGnetic External Control, or MAGEC. The technology platform provides the basis of NSO s core product offerings, including MAGEC-EOS, which allows for the minimally invasive treatment of early-onset and adolescent scoliosis, as well as the PRECICE limb lengthening system, which allows for the correction of long bone limb length discrepancy, as well as enhanced bone healing in patients that have experienced traumatic injury. We continue to focus significant research and development efforts to expand our MAS product platform and additional applications of the MAGEC technology to advance the applications of our unique technology into procedurally-integrated surgical solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes. Such applications include tumor, trauma, and deformity, as well as increased fixation options and sagittal alignment products. 
 We intend to continually expand our product and service offerings as we execute on our strategy to offer customers an end-to-end, integrated procedural solution for spine surgery. We have dedicated and continue to dedicate significant resources toward training spine surgeons around the world; both those who are new to our MAS product platform, as well as ongoing education for MAS-trained surgeons attending advanced courses.  
 Revenues and Operations 
 To date, the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of implants, biologics and disposables and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Additionally, following the closing of the acquisition of BNN Holdings Corp. on July 1, 2016, we expect our IOM service and support revenue to increase compared to previous periods. We loan our proprietary software-driven nerve monitoring systems and surgical instrument sets at no cost to surgeons and hospitals that purchase disposables and implants for use in individual procedures. In addition, we often place our proprietary software-driven nerve monitoring systems, MaXcess and other MAS instrument sets with hospitals for an extended period at no up-front cost to them. Our implants, biologics and disposables are currently sold and shipped from our distribution and warehousing operations. We generally recognize revenue for implants, biologics and disposables upon receiving acknowledgement of a purchase order and upon completion of delivery. We sell MAS instrument sets, MaXcess devices, and our proprietary software-driven nerve monitoring systems, however this does not make up a material part of our business. 
 The majority of our operations are located and the majority of our sales have been generated in the United States. We sell our products in the United States through a sales force comprised primarily of exclusive independent sales agents and directly-employed sales representatives, both engaged to sell only NuVasive products. Our sales force provides a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and is compensated based on sales and product placements in their territories. Sales force commissions are reflected in the sales, marketing and administrative operating expense line item within our statement of operations. We are continuing to invest in our expansion of international sales efforts with the focus on European, Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. Our international sales force is comprised of directly-employed sales representatives as well as exclusive distributors and independent sales agents.

Results of Operations  
 Revenue       

Our spinal hardware product line offerings include our implants and fixation products, and following the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies, include the MAGEC-EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system and the PRECICE limb lengthening system. Our surgical support product line offerings include IOM services, disposables and biologics, all of which are used to aid spinal surgery .  
 The continued adoption of minimally invasive procedures for spine has led to the expansion of our procedure volume. In addition, increased market acceptance in our international markets contributed to the increase in revenues for the periods presented. We expect continued adoption of our innovative minimally invasive procedures and deeper penetration into existing accounts and international markets as our sales force executes on our strategy of selling the full mix of our products and services. However, the continued consolidation and increased purchasing power of our hospital customers and group purchasing organizations, the continued existence of physician-owned distributorships, recent changes in the public and private insurance markets regarding reimbursement, and ongoing policy and legislative changes in the United States have created less predictability in the lumbar portion of the spine market and have limited the domestic spine market s procedural growth rate. Accordingly, we believe that our growth in revenue in 2016 will come primarily from share gains in the shift toward less invasive spinal surgery, revenue from newly acquired products and services, and international growth. 
 Revenue from our spinal hardware product line offerings increased $23.9 million and $75.8 million, or 17% and 18%, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same period in 2015. Revenue associated with our 2016 acquisitions accounted for approximately 11% and 9% of the increase in spinal hardware revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Product volume for our business, excluding 2016 acquisitions, increased our revenue by approximately 6% and 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable pricing changes of approximately 1% and 1.5%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Foreign currency fluctuation had an insignificant impact on revenue from spinal hardware for the periods presented. 
 Revenue from our surgical support product line offerings increased $15.2 million and $19.3 million, or 25% and 10%, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same period in 2015. Revenue associated with our acquisitions during 2016 accounted for approximately 23% and 8% of the increase in surgical support revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Product volume for our business, excluding 2016 acquisitions, increased our revenue by approximately 2% and 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Pricing changes had an insignificant impact on the change in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Cost of Goods Sold, Excluding Below Amortization of Intangible Assets     

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, labor and overhead associated with product manufacturing, purchased goods, inventory-related costs and royalty expense, as well as the cost of providing IOM services, which includes personnel and physician oversight costs. We primarily procure and manufacture our goods in the United States, and accordingly, foreign currency fluctuations have not materially impacted our cost of goods sold. 
 Cost of goods sold increased $10.0 million, or 20%, and $29.9 million, or 21% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Cost of goods sold for our business, excluding our 2016 acquisitions, increased as a result of the growth in volume, slightly offset with favorable shifts in price, for an overall increase of approximately 9% and 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. I nventory expense associated with the purchase accounting for our acquisition of Ellipse Technologies  accounted for approximately 5% and 10% of the total increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively .  The cost of goods sold associated with the operations of our 2016 acquisitions accounted for approximately 23% and 10% of the total increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The overall increases in cost of goods sold were partially offset by decreases in other cost of goods sold expenses of approximately 17% and 10% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, related to reductions in costs  from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act s medical device tax in 2016,  expiring royalty obligations for certain product lines, and other non-recurring inventory related items. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue remained relatively consistent; experiencing a 1% decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, for the reasons described above.  
 On a long-term basis, we expect cost of goods sold, as a percentage of revenue, to decrease moderately.  
 Operating Expenses    

34 
 
   Table of Contents   

Sales, Marketing and Administrative  
 Sales, marketing and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, commissions and training costs for shareowners engaged in sales, marketing and customer support functions. The expense also includes distributor commissions, freight expenses, surgeon training costs, depreciation expense for property and equipment such as surgical instrument sets, and administrative expenses for both shareowners and third party service providers.   
 Sales, marketing and administrative expenses increased $21.3 million or 19% and $52.8 million or 16% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily related to increases in shareowner compensation due to increased headcount, and costs which increase as a function of the increase in revenue and international expansion such as distributor commissions and freight. Sales, marketing and administrative expenses associated with our acquisitions in 2016 accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of the increase in sales, marketing and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended  September  30, 2016, respectively. 
 As a percentage of revenue, sales, marketing and administrative expenses remained consistent  during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  compared to the same periods in 2015. On a long-term basis, we expect total sales, marketing and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, to decrease moderately. However, during the current period there have been increased costs associated with acquisitions and related activities. To date, foreign currency fluctuations have not materially impacted our sales, marketing, and administrative expense. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of product research and development, clinical trial and study costs, regulatory and clinical functions, and compensation and other shareowner related expenses. In the last several years, we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our MAS platform, including iGA, and our comprehensive product portfolio. We have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology, particularly in the area of spinal hardware products. We continue to invest in research and development programs. 
 Research and development expense increased by $3.3 million or 36% and $7.8 million or 29% during the  three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,  respectively,  compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in spending is primarily due to product related expenses associated with NSO, as well as increased spending for our other technologies.  
 Research and development costs as a percentage of revenue have remained relatively consistent throughout the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. However, on a long-term basis, excluding unique items, we expect total research and development costs as a percentage of revenue to increase moderately  in support of our ongoing development and regulatory approval efforts.  
 Litigation Liability Gain (Loss) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we settled our ongoing litigation with Medtronic. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a gain of $43.3 million related to the settlement. Litigation liability gain of $42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to the recognition of a $56.4 million gain stemming from a favorable appeal in Phase 1 of the Medtronic litigation, which revised the award for lost profits and convoyed sales, and a gain of $2.8 million in litigation accrual change related to the settlement of the NeuroVision trademark litigation reducing the accrual from $30.0 million to $27.2 million. The litigation liability gains were partially offset by litigation liability losses of $13.8 million in connection with the OIG investigation and $2.8 million in a general litigation matter. See Note 11 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion .  
 Interest and Other Expense, Net 
 Total interest expense increased $3.7 million and $8.3 million  during the  three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 as a result of issuance of the 2021 Senior Convertible Notes in March 2016. Additionally, a loss of $17.4 million was recognized in March 2016 on the repurchases of $276.8 million principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Senior Convertible Notes, which was recorded in other expense. Other income, net, includes foreign currency exchange and derivative instrument gains (losses) of $0.1 million and $(0.1) million, net of foreign currency hedges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the pound sterling, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Singapore dollar, and the yen. The total interest and other expense, net, included marginal income earned on marketable securities.

Income Tax Expense  

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 67% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 41% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The higher effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the mix of earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the mix of earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and a one-time release in valuation allowances during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The lower effective income tax rate for 2016 was primarily due to increased research credits and current year income tax benefits related to excess share-based compensation payments as a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016, offset by larger 2015 tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances and tax reserves on certain executive compensation deductions. See Note 1 to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and its impacts to our financials. 
   Liquidity, Cash   Flows and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, proceeds from our convertible notes issuances, and access to our revolving line of credit. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions. We have historically invested our cash primarily in the U.S. treasuries and government agencies, corporate debt, and money market funds. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity and other market risks. The general condition of the financial markets and an economy may increase those risks and may affect the value and liquidity of our current investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales, marketing and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, successful vertical integration of our manufacturing process, the continuing market acceptance of our products, the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions or other business combination transactions, the outcome of current and future litigation, the evolution of our globalization initiative, and continuous international expansions of our business. We believe that our cash flow from operations and growing operations will continue to fund the ongoing core business.  As current borrowing sources become due, we may be required to access the capital markets for additional funding. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. 
 A substantial portion of our operations are located in the United States, and the majority of our sales and cash generation since inception have been made in the United States. Accordingly, we do not have material net cash flow exposures to foreign currency rate fluctuations. However, as our business in markets outside of the United States continues to increase, we will be exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, primarily in the pound sterling, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Singapore dollar, and the yen, could adversely affect our financial results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. We enter into forward currency contracts to partially offset the impact from fluctuations of the foreign currency rates on our third party and short-term intercompany receivables and payables between our domestic and international operations. At  September  30, 2016, the cash balance held by our foreign subsidiaries with currencies other than the United States dollar was approximately $27.9 million and  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all of current foreign earnings in order to partially support foreign working capital and to expand our existing operations outside the United States.  As of   September   30, 2016, our account receivable  balance held by our foreign subsidiaries with currencies other than the United States dollar  was approximately $21.8 million.  We have operations in markets in which there is governmental instability which could impact funds that flow into the medical reimbursement system. In addition, loss of financial stability within these markets could lead to delays in reimbursement or inability to remit payment due to currency controls.  Specifically, we have operations and/or sales in Puerto Rico, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. We do not have any material financial exposure to one customer or one country that would significantly hinder our liquidity .

During the nine months ended   September   30, 2016, we settled and paid our ongoing litigation with Medtronic for $45.0 million, which resulted in a gain of $43.3 million as we eliminated our previous accrual of $88.3 million related to this matter.   See Note 11 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  
 On August 31, 2015, we received a civil investigative demand, or CID, issued by the Department of Justice, or DOJ, pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. The CID requires the delivery of a wide range of documents and information related to an investigation by the DOJ concerning allegations that we assisted a physician group customer in submitting improper claims for reimbursement and made improper payments to the physician group in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. We are cooperating with the DOJ. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this investigation, and the probable outcome of this matter cannot be determined. 
 We are involved in a number of legal actions and investigations arising out of the normal course of our business as discussed in Note 11 of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending legal actions and investigations, we cannot predict the outcome, and, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome, other than those matters disclosed in this Quarterly Report. We have no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds our current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described in our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and access to capital resources.  Additionally, it is possible that as part of the ongoing legal appeals process, regardless of our assessment of the probability of a loss, we could be required to set aside funds in an escrow or purchase a performance bond. These requirements to escrow funding could have an adverse impact on our ability to access our current liquidity or impact our access to additional capital resources. 
 We currently have $125.7 million in principal outstanding of senior convertible notes that will mature on July 1, 2017. Holders of the notes may elect to convert at any time beginning January 1, 2017. It is our intent to settle all conversions through combination settlement, whereby we would repay the principal amount in cash and the excess conversion value in shares of common stock. At September 30, 2016, a minimal amount of holders of the 2017 Notes had elected to convert for which the Company will settle in the fourth quarter 2016 through combination settlement. Refer to the below section subtitled  2.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017  for further details. 
 On September 12, 2016, we completed an acquisition of an imaging software and technology platform known as Lessray, for which the Company recorded a preliminary purchase accounting fair value estimate for $36.0 million of contingent consideration liabilities related to the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, which we anticipate will become payable at varying times between 2017 and 2020. We expect the imaging software and technology platform to be incorporated into our MAS platform to form a foundational element in our imaging, navigation and automation platform development strategy.  
 On July 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of BNN Holdings Corp. for an upfront payment of $98.0 million, which was funded through cash and investments on hand. In connection with the closing, we used approximately $92.1 million (net of cash acquired and amounts retained for acquired provisional obligations) of our available cash and investments on hand to pay the upfront payment to security holders of BNN Holdings Corp., as well as related transaction fees and expenses. 
 On February 11, 2016, we acquired Ellipse Technologies for an upfront payment of $380.0 million (including holdbacks for retained employment of Ellipse Technologies leadership that is to be expensed and is not considered part of the final purchase price) and a potential milestone payment of $30.0 million payable in 2017 related to the achievement of specific revenue targets. In connection with the closing, we used approximately $380.7 million (net of cash acquired) of our available cash and investments on hand to pay the upfront payment to security holders of Ellipse Technologies, as well as related transaction fees and expenses. 
 In furtherance of our initiative to increase the amount of products that we self-manufacture, in 2015 we added a manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio of approximately 179,000 square feet and announced our plans to build out and equip the new facility in order to expand our internal manufacturing efforts.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $203.8 million and $470.1 million at   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and avail  able liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months. We could have varying needs for cash as a result of the achievement of certain acquisition related milestones. We anticipate funding these milestones from cash on   hand and operations, however, we have the ability to fund these from our existing line of credit if necessary. The change in liquidity during the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 of $266.3 million was mainly driven by the funding of our acquisition of   Ellipse Technologies of approximately $380.1 million (net of cash acquired), $343.8 million repurchase of a portion of our Senior Convertible Notes due 2017, $92.1 million (net of cash acquired and   amounts retained for acquired provisional obligations  ) for   the acquisition of BNN Holdings Corp., $66.3 million net for the call spread on the sale and purchase of warrants and bond hedge, $24.4 million cash tax payments on behalf of shareowners with net share settlement, and ordinary seasonal payments such as an  nual bonuses, offset by inflows of $634.1 million net issuance of our Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 and cash flow from operations. At   September   30, 2016, we have cash totaling $7.4 million in restricted accounts which are not available to us to meet an  y ongoing capital requirements if and when needed. Future litigation or requirements to escrow funds could materially impact our liquidity and our ability to invest in and run our business on an ongoing basis.  
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was $96.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $48.0 million for the same period in 2015. The $48.0 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to income tax payments in the prior year shifting to income tax refunds in the current year.  
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was $290.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $19.3 million used for the same period in 2015. The $270.7 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the $380.1 million cash payment (net of cash received) to fund the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies, the $92.1 million cash payment (net of cash acquired and amounts retained for acquired provisional obligations) for the acquisition of BNN Holdings Corp., and $22.0 million used in other acquisition related investments including purchases of intangible assets. The funding of the Ellipse Technologies acquisition was partially offset by a net increase of $278.1 million cash received related to activities within investment portfolios over the periods presented. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities was $204.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to  $29.0 million   cash used for  the same period in 2015. The $233.5 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net issuance of the 2021 Senior Convertible Notes of $634.1 million, offset by the net $66.3 million purchase of a call spread related to that issuance. Additionally, we used approximately $343.8 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a portion of the 2017 Senior Convertible Notes. 
 Treasury stock purchases decreased $28.1 million due to a decrease in equity award vesting and stock option exercises during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. We use net share settlement on stock issuances, which results in cash tax payments we make on behalf of shareowners and a decrease in the cash receipt from the issuance of common stock upon the exercising of stock options. Net share settlement is generally used in lieu of cash payments by shareowners for minimum tax withholding or exercise costs for equity awards. The net share settlement is accounted for as a treasury share repurchase transaction, with the cost of any deemed repurchased shares included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in total equity at the time of settlement. Additionally, net share settlement for tax withholding requires us to fund a significant amount of cash for certain tax payment obligations from time-to-time with respect to the shareowner tax obligations for vested equity awards. We anticipate using cash generated from operating activities to fund such payments.

Senior Convertible Notes  
 2.25% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 
 In March 2016, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of unsecured Senior Convertible Notes with a stated interest rate of 2.25% and a maturity date of March 15, 2021, which we refer to as the 2021 Notes. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and costs directly related to the offering, were approximately $634.1 million. Interest on the 2021 Notes began accruing upon issuance and is payable semi-annually. The 2021 Notes may be settled in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, solely at our discretion. It is our current intent and policy to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves satisfying the principal amount outstanding with cash and any note conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock. The initial conversion rate of the 2021 Notes is 16.7158 shares per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $59.82 per share, subject to adjustments. Prior to September 15, 2020, holders may convert their 2021 Notes only under the following conditions: (a) during any calendar quarter beginning June 30, 2016, if the reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 days out of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (b) during the five business day period in which the trading price of the 2021 Notes falls below 98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date; and (c) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the 2021 Notes. From September 15, 2020 and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 15, 2021, holders may convert their 2021 Notes at any time (regardless of the foregoing circumstances).  We may not redeem the 2021 Notes prior to March 20, 2019. We may redeem the 2021 Notes, at our option, in whole or in part on or after March 20, 2019 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2020 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we deliver written notice of a redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date . No principal payments are due on the 2021 Notes prior to maturity. Other than restrictions relating to certain fundamental changes and consolidations, mergers or asset sales and customary anti-dilution adjustments, the 2021 Notes do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict us from paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing any of our other securities. We are unaware of any current events or market conditions that would allow holders to convert the 2021 Notes.   The impact of the convertible feature will be dilutive to our earnings per share when our stock price average for the period is greater than the conversion price. 
 In connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, we entered into the hedge transactions, which we refer to as the 2021 Hedge, with the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates, which we refer to as the 2021 Counterparties, entitling us to purchase up to 10,865,270 shares of our own common stock at an initial stock price of $59.82 per share, each of which is subject to adjustment. The cost of the 2021 Hedge was $111.2 million. The 2021 Hedge will expire on March 15, 2021. The 2021 Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2021 Notes if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the 2021 Hedge. Our assumed exercise of the 2021 Hedge is considered anti-dilutive since the effect of the inclusion would always be anti-dilutive with respect to the calculation of diluted earnings per share.    
 We also sold warrants, which we refer to as the 2021 Warrants, to the 2021 Counterparties to acquire up to 10,865,270 common shares of our stock. The 2021 Warrants will expire on various dates from June 2021 through December 2021 and may be settled in cash or net shares. It is our current intent and policy to settle all conversions in shares of our common stock. We received $44.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2021 Warrants. The 2021 Warrants could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period exceeds the strike price of the 2021 Warrants, which is $80.00 per share.

2.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017  
 In June 2011, we issued $402.5 million principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes, which we refer to as the 2017 Notes, with a stated interest rate of 2.75% and a maturity date of July 1, 2017. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers  discounts and costs directly related to the offering, were approximately $359.2 million. The 2017 Notes may be settled in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, solely at our discretion. It is our current intent and policy to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock. The initial conversion rate of the 2017 Notes is 23.7344 shares per $1,000 principal amount, or equivalent to conversion price of approximately $42.13 per share, which is subject to adjustment. Beginning January 1, 2017 and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding July 1, 2017, holders may convert their 2017 Notes at any time. Prior to January 1, 2017, holders may convert their 2017 Notes only under the conditions as described in Note 6 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes our common stock trading at 130% of the conversion price for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days.  It is our current intent and policy to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves satisfying the principal amount outstanding with cash and any note conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.  The impact of the convertible feature will be dilutive to our earnings per share when our stock price average for the period is greater than the conversion price. Interest on the 2017 Notes began accruing upon issuance and is payable semi-annually on January 1st and July 1st each year. At September 30, 2016, holders of the 2017 Notes were in a convertible position, as the reported sale price of the Company s common stock for 20 days out of the last 30 consecutive trading days ending with September 30, 2016 exceeded 130% of the $42.13 per share conversion price on each applicable trading day. At September 30, 2016, a minimal amount of holders of the 2017 Notes had elected to convert their notes. We will settle such conversion in the fourth quarter 2016 through the combination settlement described above. The 2017 Notes are recorded as current liabilities on the September 30, 2016 consolidated balance sheet. 
 In connection with the offering of the 2017 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which we refer to as the 2017 Hedge, with the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates, which we refer to as the Counterparties, entitling us to purchase up to 9,553,096 shares of our common stock at an initial stock price of $42.13 per share, each of which is subject to adjustment. The cost of the 2017 Hedge was $80.1 million. The 2017 Hedge expires on July 1, 2017. The 2017 Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2017 Notes if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the 2017 Hedge.  Our assumed exercise of the 2017 Hedge is considered anti-dilutive since the effect of the inclusion would always be anti-dilutive with respect to the calculation of diluted earnings per share.     
 In addition, we sold warrants, which we refer to as the 2017 Warrants, to the Counterparties to acquire up to 477,654 shares of our Series A Participating Preferred Stock, at an initial strike price of $988.51 per share, subject to adjustment. Each share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 20 shares of our common stock. The 2017 Warrants expire on various dates from September 2017 through January 2018 and may be settled in cash or net shares.  It is our current intent and policy to settle all conversions in shares of our common stock, should the conversion occur.  We received $47.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2017 Warrants. The 2017 Warrants could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period (the quarter or year-to-date period) exceeds the strike price of the 2017 Warrants. 
 In March 2016, we used approximately $345.2 million of the net proceeds from the 2021 Notes offering to repurchase approximately $276.8 million in principal amount outstanding of the $402.5 million 2017 Notes. The repurchase of a portion of the 2017 Notes resulted in a remaining balance of $125.7 million in principal outstanding as of September 30, 2016.    
 Revolving Senior Credit Facility    
 In February 2016, we entered into a credit agreement, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement, for a revolving senior credit facility, which we refer to as the Facility, that provides for secured revolving loans, multicurrency loan options and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement also contains an expansion feature, which allows us to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Facility provided we remain in compliance with the underlying financial covenants.  The Facility matures on February 8, 2021, and includes a sub-limit of $15.0 million for letters of credit and a sub-limit of $5.0 million for swing line loans. All of our assets and assets of our material domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the Facility (subject to customary exceptions) pursuant to the term set forth in the Security and Pledge Agreement executed in favor of the administrative agent by the Company. Each of our material domestic subsidiaries guarantees the Facility . At September 30, 2016 we did not carry any outstanding revolving loan under the Facility. 
 Borrowings under the Facility are used by us to provide financing for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potential mergers and acquisitions. Loans under the Facility bear interest, at our option, at either LIBOR (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00 % - 2.00 % per annum subject to our applicable consolidated leverage ratio or the Base Rate (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.0% - 1.25% per annum subject to our applicable consolidated leverage ratio. The Facility has a commitment fee, which accrues at a rate of 0.2% - 0.4% per annum (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) based on our current leverage ratio.

   Table of Contents   

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of   default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants require us to maintain ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense, and to consolidated debt, respec  tively, as defined in the Credit Agreement, at varying scales throughout the life of the Credit Agreement. The Facility grants the lenders preferred first priority liens and security interests in our capital stock, intercompany debt and all of our present   and future property and assets, including each guarantor.     
     Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts, inventories, valuation of goodwill, intangibles, other long-term assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal proceedings. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments

   Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

   Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time lines specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in SEC Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of any potential changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report.  
 There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 In order to avoid the cost and uncertainty of further litigation, and without any admission of fault or liability, the Parties desire to fully and finally resolve and settle the Litigation and the PTO Proceedings through the grant of certain releases, licenses, standstills and other valuable and adequate consideration as set forth below.

Neither this Agreement nor any release or other terms contained within it may be construed or used as an admission of any issues, facts, wrongdoing, liability, or violation of law whatsoever. 
 13.10   Bankruptcy .  Each Party acknowledges that all rights and licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the   Bankruptcy Code  ), licenses of rights to  intellectual property  as defined under Section 101(56) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Each Party acknowledges that if such Party, as a debtor in possession or a trustee-in-bankruptcy in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, rejects this Agreement, the other Party may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement as provided in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Each Party irrevocably waives all arguments and defenses arising under 11 U.S.C. 365(c)(1) or successor provisions to the effect that applicable law excuses the Party, other than the debtor, from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or debtor in possession as a basis for opposing assumption of the Agreements by the other Party in a case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that such consent is required under 11 U.S.C.   365(c)(1) or any successor statute.  
 13.11   Entire Agreement .  This Agreement, together with the ADR Process Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements or communications as to such subject matter, including the Term Sheet.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and licenses granted to NuVasive under the Settlement and License Agreement between NuVasive and Medtronic dated April 25, 2013 shall remain in effect in addition to this Agreement; however, this Agreement will take precedence with respect to any conflict as to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated after the Effective Date and signed on behalf of NuVasive and Medtronic by their respective authorized representatives.

 CONFIDENTIAL 
    13.12    Const  ruction  .  Each Party agrees that in any dispute regarding the interpretation or construction of this Agreement, no statutory, common law or other presumption shall operate in favor of or against any Party to this Agreement by virtue of its role in drafting   or not drafting its terms and conditions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable or otherwise in conflict with law, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. If any provision of this Agreem  ent is deemed illegal, invalid or unenforceable or otherwise in conflict with law, it shall be modified to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid or enforceable or otherwise in accordance with law while effectuating the same or similar intent of the   Parties.  As used in this Agreement, the words  include  and  including,  and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words  without limitation.   
 13.13   Counterparts .  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts by the Parties and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement.

 Patrick Miles 
 P.O. Box 1412 
 Rancho Santa Fe, CA  92067 
   
 Dear Pat, 
   
 We are pleased that you have agreed to continue your employment pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement ( Agreement ) and assume the role as NuVasive s Vice Chairman effective September 11, 2016, and will remain a member of NuVasive s board of directors.   
   
 In your new role as Vice Chairman, your responsibilities will include: (1) serving as a high level advisor to NuVasive s management team; (2) assisting with NuVasive s surgeon relations; and (3) serving as a mentor to other NuVasive employees.  You agree that you will perform these duties in a timely, professional and workmanlike manner.  You will serve in this role for a three year term of employment.  You will retain ultimate flexibility as an at-will employee.  Either you or Nuvasive may choose to terminate the employment relationship at any time for any or no reason. 
   
 In your new role as Vice Chairman and a continuing board member, your total annual compensation package will consist of annual base salary of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).  NuVasive will establish a deferred compensation arrangement effective January 1, 2017, pursuant to which you may make an irrevocable election prior to the beginning of each calendar year to receive all or a part of this annual base salary paid semiannually in arrears in the form of fully vested shares of NuVasive common stock or fully vested deferred stock units, in each case determined based on the closing price of NuVasive common stock on the last trading day of the semi-annual period.  The terms of this deferred compensation arrangement will be established pursuant to Sections 12 and 16 of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan of NuVasive, Inc.  Any cash payments you elect to receive will be paid monthly in arrears from the service provided.  You will not be eligible for annual bonuses or other incentive compensation except as set out in this Agreement.  Your entitlement to any bonus for the year 2016 will be prorated up to the date of your transition from President to Vice Chairman, and payment of any bonus will occur based on target performance in accordance with NuVasive s regular bonus payment schedule in 2017.  
   
 While serving as Vice Chairman, you will continue to be eligible for welfare and fringe benefits under NuVasive s benefit plans for executive employees as in effect from time to time, including but not limited to NuVasive s Executive Severance Plan.  Termination of your employment upon or after the conclusion of your three year term of employment will not be considered an involuntary termination of your employment that would entitle you to benefits under the terms of NuVasive s Executive Severance Plan.  Your existing Change in Control Agreement and Indemnification Agreement remain in effect, and your outstanding equity awards under the  2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2014 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the  NuVasive Incentive Plans ), including your outstanding Nonqualified Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Cash Awards, will continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the operative agreements.  In addition, you will also be granted Share Purchase Matching Performance Restricted Stock Units subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Grant and Agreement attached hereto as  Attachment 1 .  You will not be entitled to receive any other awards under the NuVasive Incentive Plans during your employment.

If your employment terminates for any reason during the three year term of this agreement, you agree that you will immediately tender your resignation as a director to the board of directors.  In addition, if the board determines that you have materially breached any obligation of this Agreement, including your obligations regarding confidentiality, noninterference with NuVasive s business, or have engaged in conduct that gives rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest with NuVasive, you agree that you will immediately resign from the board of directors.  You also agree that if, any time during your remaining tenure, the board requests your resignation, you will immediately comply with that request, consistent with current NuVasive policy.    In the event your employment and board membership terminate during the three year term of this agreement, other than a voluntary resignation or a termination as the result of your breach of this Agreement, or if your tenure as a board member ends after the three year term of this Agreement, other than as a result of your breach of this Agreement, you will be offered the opportunity to serve as a consultant for NuVasive for a period up to September 11, 2021, and to continue to vest in any equity awards you have been granted by NuVasive, including the Share Purchase Matching Performance Restricted Stock Units referred in this Agreement. 
   
 As an executive employee of NuVasive, you acknowledge that you have an ongoing fiduciary duty to NuVasive.  You agree that you will not accept work, enter into a contract or accept an obligation inconsistent or incompatible with your employment and fiduciary obligations to NuVasive, or knowingly engage in any activity that compromises the interests of NuVasive.  You agree to act in the best interest of NuVasive during your employment.  Notwithstanding any of these requirements, you will be allowed to participate in appropriate civic and charitable activities, provided such activities do not interfere with your duties as Vice Chairman or a member of the NuVasive board of directors.  You will also be permitted to participate in the management or as a board member of other enterprises provided they are not competitive in any way with the business of NuVasive, its subsidiaries or its distributors, and such service does not interfere with your role as NuVasive s Vice Chairman and/or a member of NuVasive s board of director, subject to full disclosure and review by NuVasive s board of directors in accordance with NuVasive s Corporate Governance Guidelines.  All obligations under your April 8, 2014 Proprietary Information, Inventions and Restrictive Covenant Agreement remain in effect and continue throughout your employment.   
   
 In consideration for the grant of the Share Purchase Matching Performance Restricted Stock Units described above, you agree that, for a one year period following the termination of your employment for any reason, you will not provide any services to any business operating in any line or type of business conducted by NuVasive or its subsidiaries.  For that same one year period, you will not hire or solicit, directly or indirectly, any former or current employees of NuVasive, its subsidiaries and/or distributors, or solicit the business of  any customers, clients, medical partners (including physicians utilizing NuVasive s products and services) of NuVasive, its subsidiaries and/or distributors.   
   
 In the event you breach any of the post-termination obligations outlined above, you shall, within 30 days following notice from NuVasive, pay to NuVasive in cash an amount equal to the value of any Share Purchase Matching Performance Restricted Stock Units that vested and were paid to you on or after the Effective Date pursuant to this Agreement, which amounts and shares you would not have received had you not remained in the employment of NuVasive and entered into this Agreement.

Upon the Participant s death or termination of Service due to Disability, the number of shares of Stock that shall be issued in full settlement of this Award on the date specified in Section 4.1 below shall be the Number of PRSUs (as determined on or promptly following January 28, 2017 pursuant to the measurement criteria specified in the Notice of Grant, or such earlier date of the Participant s Death or Disability based upon Participant s purchases prior to such date).  In such an event, there shall be no application of the Performance Multiplier hereunder. 
 (b)  Change in Control .  Upon any Change in Control, the number of shares of Stock that shall be issued in full settlement of this Award shall be equal to the greatest of (i) the number of PRSUs initially awarded hereunder (i.e., a number of units equal to the number of Qualifying Shares as provided in the Notice of Grant), or (ii) such number of PRSUs multiplied by the Performance Multiplier determined using a Performance Period that ends on the day prior to such Change in Control transaction, in each case rounding up to the nearest whole share of Stock. 
   (c)  Involuntary Separation from Service Not for Cause .  In the event that the Participant s Service with the Company in all capacities is involuntarily terminated by the Company not for  cause  (as defined below), the number of shares of Stock that shall be issued in full settlement of this Award shall be equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of PRSUs initially awarded hereunder (i.e., a number of units equal to the number of Qualifying Shares as provided in the Notice of Grant)  times  (y) the result of a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full months that the Participant provided Service to the Company in any capacity during the Performance Period and the denominator of which shall be sixty (60),  multiplied by  (ii) the Performance Multiplier determined using a Performance Period that ends on the date that  
 3 
 
  the Participant s Service to the Company ends, with   the resultant number of shares of Stock (if any) rounded-up to the nearest whole share of Stock.

D.   
 
 Participant engaging in acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct on the part of the executive with respect to his/her obligations or otherwise relating to the business of Company, its affiliates or customers.

 3.3    No Monetary Payment Required.   The Participant is not required to make any monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) as a condition to receiving the PRSUs or any shares of Stock issued upon settlement of Vested PRSUs (as defined in Section 4.1 below), the consideration for which shall be the Participant rendering Service as provided in this Agreement to a Participating Company or for its benefit. 
       3.4   Dividend Equivalent Units.   On the date that the Company pays a cash dividend to holders of Stock generally, if any, the Participant shall be credited with a number of additional whole Dividend Equivalent Units determined by dividing (a) the product of (i) the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Stock on such date, and (ii) the number of PRSUs which have not been settled as of such date,  by  (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Any resulting fractional Dividend Equivalent Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.  Any such additional Dividend Equivalent Units shall be added to the Number of PRSUs specified in the Grant Notice and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, and shall be settled or forfeited in the same manner and at the same time, as the PRSUs with respect to which they have been credited. 
 4.   Vesting; Forfeiture . 
   4.1   Vesting of PRSUs.   Provided that the Participant remains in Service through the applicable date specified in this Section 4.1 and continues to retain the Qualifying Shares (as tracked by Participant s brokerage firm without regard to transactions involving any other Shares that the Participant may otherwise own or receive (including via post-January 28, 2017  purchase or vesting of other Company equity awards during his Service)), any PRSUs achieved pursuant to the Award shall become vested upon the earliest date to occur of the following (the   Vesting Date  ):

 (b)  the Participant s death; 
 (c)  termination of the Participant s Service due to Disability;

 (e)  immediately before any Change in Control. 
 Such PRSUs, when so vested, are referred to herein as   Vested PRSUs  . 
 4.2   Leaves of Absence.  
 (a)  If Participant takes an approved medical, FMLA (or other statutorily protected leave), or military leave, while an employee of the Company (each, an   Approved Leave  ) and returns from such leave for at least thirty calendar days, then Participant shall be treated as if the period of such Approved Leave had been a period of continuous Service with the Company or Affiliate, and such Vested PRSUs shall be settled in accordance with Section 5. 
 (b)  In the event the Participant takes a leave of absence as an employee other than an Approved Leave, the number of Vested PRSUs, as determined under Section 3.2, shall be prorated by multiplying the Vested PRSUs by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of whole months during the Performance Period that Participant had been in continuous Service with the Company or Affiliate, and the denominator of which is the number of months the Performance Period spans, rounding up to the nearest whole number. 
 (c)  In the event of Participant s termination of Service as an employee during any leave of absence, then the PRSUs shall expire in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 4.4 below. 
 4.3   Vesting of Dividend Equivalent Units.   Any Dividend Equivalent Units shall become vested (and also constitute   Vested PRSUs  ) at the same time as the PRSUs with respect to which they have been credited. 
   4.4   Forfeiture of PRSUs That Are Not Vested PRSUs Upon Termination of Service.   Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.1, any PRSUs that are not Vested PRSUs will terminate automatically without any further action by the Company and be forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company upon Participant s termination of Service. 
   5.   Settlement of Vested PRSUs . 
 5.1   Distribution of Shares in Settlement of Vested PRSUs.  
   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, any shares of Stock that are determined to be payable pursuant to Section 3.2 shall be distributed to Participant (or Participant s estate in the event of death) with respect to Participant s Vested  
 5 
 
  PRSUs within thirty days following the Vesting Date for such PRSUs, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 or Section 9.1 (the    Settlement Date   ).  
 (a)  All distributions of shares of Stock with respect to Participant s Vested PRSUs shall be made by the Company in the form of whole shares.  In lieu of any fractional share of Stock, the Company shall make a cash payment to Participant equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional share on the date the PRSUs are settled as provided herein.  The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares of Stock upon the settlement of Vested PRSUs. 
 (b)  Shares of Stock issued in settlement of Vested PRSUs shall not be subject to any restriction on transfer other than any such restriction as may be required pursuant to Section 5.3 or the Company s Insider Trading Policy. 
 5.2   Certificate Registration.    The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit any or all shares of Stock acquired by the Participant pursuant to the settlement of Vested PRSUs with the Company s transfer agent, including any successor transfer agent, to be held in book entry form, or to deposit such shares for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice.  Except as provided by the foregoing, a certificate for the shares of Stock acquired by the Participant shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the name of the Participant s estate.  
   5.3   Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Shares  .   The grant of the Award and issuance of shares of Stock upon settlement of Vested PRSUs shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.  No shares of Stock may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any shares of Stock subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to the settlement of Vested PRSUs, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

 6 
 
  of Vested PRSUs.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Co  mpany have been satisfied by the Participant.  
   6.2   Withholding in Shares.   The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of a Participating Company s tax withholding obligations by deducting from the shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of Vested PRSUs a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates (and subsequently making a payment of Company cash equal to the amount of any such tax obligation to the respective tax authorities). 
   6.3   Assignment of Sale Proceeds.   Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company s Insider Trading Policy, if permitted by the Company, the Participant may satisfy the Participating Company s tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock being acquired upon settlement of Vested PRSUs.  If the Settlement Date would occur on a date on which a sale of the shares of Stock by the Participant would violate the Insider Trading Policy of the Company, the Settlement Date for such Vested PRSUs shall be deferred until the earlier of (a) the next day on which the sale of shares by the Participant would not violate the Insider Trading Policy, or (b) the 15 th  day of the third calendar month following calendar year of the Settlement Date. 
 7.   Rights as a Stockholder, Director, Employee or Consultant  .  
 The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Stock which may be issued in settlement of Vested PRSUs until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the shares of Stock are issued, except as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement and Section 4.4 of the Plan (Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure).  If the Participant is an Employee, the Participant understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Participant, the Participant s employment is  at will  and is for no specified term.  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Participant s Service at any time. 
 8.   Legends  .  
   The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing shares of Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement.  The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired pursuant to  
 7

   9.   Compliance with Section 409A  .  
 It is intended that the settlement of Vested PRSUs as set forth in this Agreement qualify for exemption from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so qualify or comply.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the PRSUs fail to satisfy the requirements of the  short-term deferral  exemption and are otherwise Section 409A Deferred Compensation, it is intended that any payment or benefit which is made or provided pursuant to or in connection with this Award shall comply in all respects with the applicable requirements of Section 409A (including applicable regulations or other administrative guidance thereunder, as determined by the Committee in good faith) to avoid the unfavorable tax consequences provided therein for non compliance.

Furthermore, to the extent that the Participant is a  specified employee  within the meaning of the Section 409A Regulations as of the date of the Participant s separation from service, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of the Participant s separation from service shall be paid to the Participant before the date (the   Delayed Payment Date  ) which is first day of the seventh month after the date of the Participant s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death following such separation from service.  All such amounts that would, but for this Section, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date. 
 9.2   Other Changes in Time of Payment.   Neither the Participant nor the Company shall take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any benefits under this Agreement in any manner which would not be in compliance with the Section 409A Regulations. 
 9.3   Amendments to Comply with Section 409A; Indemnification.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company is authorized to amend this Agreement, to void or amend any election made by the Participant under this Agreement and/or to delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any benefits in such manner as may be determined by the Company, in its discretion, to be necessary or appropriate to comply with the Section 409A Regulations without prior notice to or consent of the Participant.  The Participant hereby releases and holds harmless the Company, its directors, officers and stockholders from any and all claims that may arise from or relate to any tax liability, penalties, interest, costs, fees or other liability incurred by the Participant in connection with the Award, including as a result of the application of Section 409A. 
   9.4   Advice of Independent Tax Advisor.   The Company has not obtained a tax ruling or other confirmation from the Internal Revenue Service with regard to the application of  
 8 
 
  Section 409A to the Award, and the Company does not represent or warrant that this Agreement will avoid adverse tax consequences to the Part  icipant, including as a result of the application of Section 409A to the Award.  The Participant hereby acknowledges that he or she has been advised to seek the advice of his or her own independent tax advisor prior to entering into this Agreement and is n  ot relying upon any representations of the Company or any of its agents as to the effect of or the advisability of entering into this Agreement.  
 10.   Miscellaneous Provisions  .  
 10.1   Termination or Amendment.   The Committee may terminate or amend the Plan or this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such termination or amendment may have a materially adverse effect on the Participant s rights under this Agreement without the consent of the Participant unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or government regulation, including, but not limited to, Section 409A.  No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing. 
 10.2   Nontransferability of the Award.   Prior to the issuance of shares of Stock on the applicable Settlement Date, neither this Award nor any PRSUs subject to this Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  All rights with respect to the Award shall be exercisable during the Participant s lifetime only by the Participant or the Participant s guardian or legal representative.

 Dear Pat, 
   
 This letter is intended to be an addendum (this  Addendum ) to your letter agreement dated September 11, 2016 (the  Agreement ).   
   
 As set forth in the Agreement, in the event your employment and board membership terminate during the three year term of the Agreement, other than a voluntary resignation or a termination as the result of your breach of the Agreement, or if your tenure as a board member ends after the three year term of the Agreement, other than as a result of your breach of the Agreement, you will be offered the opportunity to serve as a consultant for NuVasive for a period up to September 11, 2021, and to continue to vest in any equity awards you have been granted by NuVasive, including the Share Purchase Matching Performance Restricted Stock Units referred in the Agreement.  The purpose of this Addendum is to clarify the compensation rate for such service by you as a consultant for NuVasive. 
   
 To the extent you serve as a consultant for NuVasive in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, NuVasive agrees that you will be compensated as a consultant at the same rate as if you continued to serve as a member of the Board, with such compensation payable in cash based on the then current value of (i) the standard annual fees payable for Board service (without regard to additional amounts payable for service as a Committee Chair or Lead Director) and (ii) the standard annual long-term equity awards payable for Board service.  Other terms and conditions governing your consulting arrangement will be subject to negotiation and execution of a consulting agreement that is reasonably satisfactory to you and NuVasive. 
   
 By executing this Addendum, both parties acknowledge and agree that the Agreement, as modified by this Addendum, remains in full force and effect and enforceable against both parties.  This Addendum shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard for choice of law provisions.  Any disputes concerning this Addendum shall be brought in the courts of the State of Delaware or of the United States of America for the District of Delaware.

If the Performance Multiplier is 0%, all PRSUs are forfeited and no shares will be paid.   
 (a)  Death or Disability .  Upon the Participant s death or termination of Service due to Disability, the number of shares of Stock that shall be issued in full settlement of this Award on the date specified in Section 4.1 below shall be the Number of PRSUs (as determined on or promptly following January 28, 2017 pursuant to the measurement criteria specified in the Notice of Grant, or such earlier date of the Participant s Death or Disability based upon Participant s purchases prior to such date).  In such an event, there shall be no application of the Performance Multiplier hereunder. 
 (b)  Change in Control .  Upon any Change in Control, the number of shares of Stock that shall be issued in full settlement of this Award shall be equal to the greatest of (i) the number of PRSUs initially awarded hereunder (i.e., a number of units equal to the number of Qualifying Shares as provided in the Notice of Grant), or (ii) such number of PRSUs multiplied by the Performance Multiplier determined using a Performance Period that ends on the day prior to such Change in Control transaction, in each case rounding up to the nearest whole share of Stock. 
   (c)  Involuntary Separation from Service Not for Cause .  In the event that the Participant s Service with the Company in all capacities is involuntarily terminated by the Company not for  cause  (as defined below), the number of shares of Stock that shall be issued in full settlement of this Award shall be equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of PRSUs initially awarded hereunder (i.e., a number of units equal to the number of Qualifying Shares as provided in the Notice of Grant)  times  (y) the result of a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full months that the Participant provided Service to the Company in any capacity during the Performance Period and the denominator of which shall be sixty (60),  multiplied by  (ii) the Performance Multiplier determined using a Performance Period that ends on the date that the

D.   
 
 Participant engaging in acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct on the part of the executive with respect to his/her obligations or otherwise relating to the business of Company, its affiliates or customers.

The Participant is not required to make any monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) as a condition to receiving the PRSUs or any shares of Stock issued upon settlement of Vested PRSUs (as defined in Section 4.1 below), the consideration for which shall be the Participant rendering Service as provided in this Agreement to a Participating Company or for its benefit. 
       3.4   Dividend Equivalent Units.   On the date that the Company pays a cash dividend to holders of Stock generally, if any, the Participant shall be credited with a number of additional whole Dividend Equivalent Units determined by dividing (a) the product of (i) the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Stock on such date, and (ii) the number of PRSUs which have not been settled as of such date,  by  (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Any resulting fractional Dividend Equivalent Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.  Any such additional Dividend Equivalent Units shall be added to the Number of PRSUs specified in the Grant Notice and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, and shall be settled or forfeited in the same manner and at the same time, as the PRSUs with respect to which they have been credited.

 (a)  If Participant takes an approved medical, FMLA (or other statutorily protected leave), or military leave, while an employee of the Company (each, an   Approved Leave  ) and returns from such leave for at least thirty calendar days, then Participant shall be treated as if the period of such Approved Leave had been a period of continuous Service with the Company or Affiliate, and such Vested PRSUs shall be settled in accordance with Section 5. 
 (b)  In the event the Participant takes a leave of absence as an employee other than an Approved Leave, the number of Vested PRSUs, as determined under Section 3.2, shall be prorated by multiplying the Vested PRSUs by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of whole months during the Performance Period that Participant had been in continuous Service with the Company or Affiliate, and the denominator of which is the number of months the Performance Period spans, rounding up to the nearest whole number. 
 (c)  In the event of Participant s termination of Service as an employee during any leave of absence, then the PRSUs shall expire in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 4.4 below. 
 4.3   Vesting of Dividend Equivalent Units.   Any Dividend Equivalent Units shall become vested (and also constitute   Vested PRSUs  ) at the same time as the PRSUs with respect to which they have been credited. 
   4.4   Forfeiture of PRSUs That Are Not Vested PRSUs Upon Termination of Service.   Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.1, any PRSUs that are not Vested PRSUs will terminate automatically without any further action by the Company and be forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company upon Participant s termination of Service. 
   5.   Settlement of Vested PRSUs . 
 5.1   Distribution of Shares in Settlement of Vested PRSUs.  
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, any shares of Stock that are determined to be payable pursuant to Section 3.2 shall be distributed to Participant (or Participant s estate in the event of death) with respect to Participant s Vested PRSUs within thirty days following the Vesting Date for such PRSUs, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 or Section 9.1 (the   Settlement Date  ). 
   EAST\129639394.4     5  
 
    (a)    All distributions of shares of Stock with respect to Participant s Vested PRSUs shall be made by the Company in the form of whole shares.  In lieu of any fractional share of Stock, the Company shall make a cash payment to Participant equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional share on the date the PRSUs are settled as provided herein.  The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares of Stock upon the settlement of Vested PRSUs.  
 (b)  Shares of Stock issued in settlement of Vested PRSUs shall not be subject to any restriction on transfer other than any such restriction as may be required pursuant to Section 5.3 or the Company s Insider Trading Policy. 
 5.2   Certificate Registration.    The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit any or all shares of Stock acquired by the Participant pursuant to the settlement of Vested PRSUs with the Company s transfer agent, including any successor transfer agent, to be held in book entry form, or to deposit such shares for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice.  Except as provided by the foregoing, a certificate for the shares of Stock acquired by the Participant shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the name of the Participant s estate.  
   5.3   Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Shares  .   The grant of the Award and issuance of shares of Stock upon settlement of Vested PRSUs shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.  No shares of Stock may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any shares of Stock subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to the settlement of Vested PRSUs, the Company may require the  Participant  to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. 
   6.   Tax Withholding  .  
 6.1   In General.   By electronically accepting the Award (as provided in the Grant Notice), the  Participant  hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the  Participant, including withholding of shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant in settlement of Vested PRSUs , and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax (including any social insurance) withholding obligations of the Participating Company, if any, which arise in connection with the Award, the vesting of PRSUs or the issuance of shares of Stock in settlement of Vested PRSUs.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company have been satisfied by the  Participant . 
   EAST\129639394.4     6  
 
      6.2    Withholding in Shares.    The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of a Participating Company s tax withholding obligations by deducting from the shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of Vested PRSUs a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates (and subsequently making a payment of Company cash equal to the amount of any such tax obligation to the respective tax authorities).  
   6.3   Assignment of Sale Proceeds.   Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company s Insider Trading Policy, if permitted by the Company, the Participant may satisfy the Participating Company s tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock being acquired upon settlement of Vested PRSUs.  If the Settlement Date would occur on a date on which a sale of the shares of Stock by the Participant would violate the Insider Trading Policy of the Company, the Settlement Date for such Vested PRSUs shall be deferred until the earlier of (a) the next day on which the sale of shares by the Participant would not violate the Insider Trading Policy, or (b) the 15 th  day of the third calendar month following calendar year of the Settlement Date. 
 7.   Rights as a Stockholder, Director, Employee or Consultant  .  
 The  Participant  shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Stock which may be issued in settlement of Vested PRSUs until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the shares of Stock are issued, except as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement and Section 4.4 of the Plan (Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure).  If the Participant is an Employee, the Participant understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Participant, the Participant   s employment is  at will  and is for no specified term.  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the  Participant  any right to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the  Participant  s Service at any time. 
 8.   Legends  .  
 The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing shares of Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement.

Furthermore, to the extent that the Participant is a  specified employee  within the meaning of the Section 409A Regulations as of the date of the Participant s separation from service, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of the Participant s separation from service shall be paid to the Participant before the date (the   Delayed Payment Date  ) which is first day of the seventh month after the date of the Participant s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death following such separation from service.  All such amounts that would, but for this Section, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date. 
 9.2   Other Changes in Time of Payment.   Neither the Participant nor the Company shall take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any benefits under this Agreement in any manner which would not be in compliance with the Section 409A Regulations.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company is authorized to amend this Agreement, to void or amend any election made by the Participant under this Agreement and/or to delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any benefits in such manner as may be determined by the Company, in its discretion, to be necessary or appropriate to comply with the Section 409A Regulations without prior notice to or consent of the Participant.  The Participant hereby releases and holds harmless the Company, its directors, officers and stockholders from any and all claims that may arise from or relate to any tax liability, penalties, interest, costs, fees or other liability incurred by the Participant in connection with the Award, including as a result of the application of Section 409A. 
   9.4   Advice of Independent Tax Advisor.   The Company has not obtained a tax ruling or other confirmation from the Internal Revenue Service with regard to the application of Section 409A to the Award, and the Company does not represent or warrant that this Agreement will avoid adverse tax consequences to the Participant, including as a result of the application of  
   EAST\129639394.4     8  
 
  Section 409A to the Award.  The Participant hereby acknowledges that he or she has been advised to seek the advice of his or her own independent tax advisor prior to entering into this Agreement and is not relying upon any representations of the Company or any of its agents as to the effect of or the advisability of entering into this Agreement.  
 10.   Miscellaneous Provisions  .  
 10.1   Termination or Amendment.   The Committee may terminate or amend the Plan or this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such termination or amendment may have a materially adverse effect on the Participant s rights under this Agreement without the consent of the  Participant unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or government regulation, including, but not limited to, Section 409A .  No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing. 
 10.2   Nontransferability of the Award.   Prior to the issuance of shares of Stock on the applicable Settlement Date, neither this Award nor any PRSUs subject to this Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
