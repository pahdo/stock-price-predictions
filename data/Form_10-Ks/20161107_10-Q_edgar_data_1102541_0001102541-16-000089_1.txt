1.  Organization 
    
  EarthLink Holdings Corp. ( EarthLink  or the  Company ), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider to business and residential customers in the United States. The Company provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers. The Company also provides nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. The Company operates an extensive network including more than   29,000   route fiber miles and   90   metro fiber rings. Through its owned and leased facilities, the Company provides data and voice IP service coverage across more than   90 percent   of the United States. The Company operates   four   reportable segments aligned around distinct customer categories: Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business, Carrier/Transport and Consumer. For further information concerning the Company s reportable segments, see Note 14,  Segment Information.  

2.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of EarthLink for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016   and the related footnote information are unaudited and have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) (the  Annual Report ). 
    
  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in the Annual Report. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which management considers necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results anticipated for the entire year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Basis of Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of EarthLink include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Revenue Recognition  . In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. The new guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue contract assets and liabilities. The new standard also includes new accounting principles related to the deferral and amortization of contract acquisition and fulfillment costs. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance that deferred the effective date by one year. The standard is now required to be adopted by public business entities in annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, and may be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. Early adoption at the original effective date is permitted.  
    
  The Company has elected to adopt the standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

  EARTHLINK HOLDINGS CORP. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  UNAUDITED - (Continued)  

Going Concern  . In August 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new guidance requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements and to provide related footnote disclosures if so. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  Leases  . In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. As of the lease commencement date, a lessee is required to recognize a liability for its lease obligation (initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments not yet paid over the lease term) and an asset for its right to use the underlying asset equal to the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement, lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the implementation of this standard on its financial statements. 
    
  Share-Based Payments  . In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the implementation of this standard on its financial statements. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows  . In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements. 

3.  Earnings per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share represents net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reported period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, including stock options and restricted stock units (collectively "Common Stock Equivalents"), were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. In applying the treasury stock method for stock-based compensation arrangements, the assumed proceeds are computed as the sum of the amount the employee must pay upon exercise, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized and the amount of excess tax benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the awards. 
    
  The following table presents the computation for basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  :

     Table of Contents  
  EARTHLINK HOLDINGS CORP. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  UNAUDITED - (Continued)  

The Company has not included the effect of Common Stock Equivalents in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   because such inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company's net loss. As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   8.8 million   stock options and restricted stock units outstanding which were excluded from the determination of dilutive earnings per share. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   0.6 million   stock options and restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities could be dilutive in future periods.  

4.   Sale of Businesses 
    
  On February 1, 2016, the Company sold certain assets related to its IT services product offerings. The primary purpose of the sale was to simplify operations and provide more flexibility to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth in the Company's core business. The purchase price in the transaction was   $29.6 million  , subject to post-closing contingencies that could increase or decrease the purchase price by up to   $5.0 million  . The Company received   $26.6 million   of cash. The other   $3.0 million   of consideration was deposited into an escrow account to fund potential indemnification obligations. The Company recognized a pretax gain of   $6.3 million   and recorded a   $2.0 million   deferred gain for contingent consideration. The gain is included in gain on sale of businesses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The carrying amount of the IT services assets was   $17.5 million  , which included   $11.4 million   of property and equipment,   $2.3 million   of goodwill,   $3.5 million   of other intangible assets and   $0.3 million   of other assets and liabilities. Total revenue of the Company's IT services business was approximately   $34.9 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  . The sale of the IT services business did not represent a strategic shift in the Company's business nor did it have a major effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, and accordingly, did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. The IT services business was previously included in the Company's Enterprise/Mid-Market and Small Business segments. 
    
  On July 15, 2016, the Company sold approximately   12,000   consumer customer relationships to one of its network providers for   $3.8 million   of cash and recognized a pretax gain of   $2.8 million  . The gain is included in gain on sale of businesses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The carrying amount of the disposed assets was   $1.0 million  . The customer relationships were previously included in the Company's Consumer segment. 

5. Acquisition 
    
  On July 13, 2016, the Company acquired Boston Retail Partners, LLC ( BRP ), a privately-held management consulting firm focused on the retail industry, for initial consideration of approximately   $11.2 million  , plus possible earn-out payments which could increase the purchase price by up to   $5.6 million  . The primary purpose of the transaction was to provide additional professional services capabilities in connection with the Company's strategy to be a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider for  multi-location retail and service businesses.  
    
  The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed of BRP were recognized at their acquisition date fair values. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, EarthLink recorded approximately   $7.4 million   of goodwill,   $3.4 million   of identifiable intangible assets,   $1.5 million   of net other assets and a   $1.1 million   liability for possible earn-out payments. The allocation of the consideration transferred was based upon a preliminary valuation and the Company s estimates and assumptions are subject to change. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to working capital adjustments, the fair value of intangible assets, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill. EarthLink has included the financial results of BRP in its consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial information for BRP has not been presented, as the effects were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

6.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Other Intangible Assets 
    
  The following table presents the components of the Company s acquired identifiable intangible assets included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  : 

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company amortizes its customer relationships using the straight-line method to match the estimated cash flow generated by such assets, and amortizes its developed technology and software, trade names and other identifiable intangible assets using the straight-line method because a pattern to which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up could not be reliably determined. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average amortization periods were   5.3   years for customer relationships,   3.8   years for developed technology and software,   4.7   years for trade names and   5.0   years for other identifiable intangible assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold intangible assets that had a gross carrying value of   $10.4 million   and a net carrying value of   $3.5 million  .

Amortization of intangible assets, which is included in depreciation and amortization in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive   Income (Loss)  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016   was as follows: 

Based on the current amount of definite-lived intangible assets, the Company expects to record amortization expense of approximately   $1.0 million   during the remaining   three   months in the year ending   December 31, 2016   and   $0.8 million  ,   $0.8 million  ,   $0.5 million  ,   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Actual amortization expense to be reported in future periods could differ materially from these estimates as a result of acquisitions, changes in useful lives and other relevant factors. 

7.  Other Accrued Liabilities 
    
  The Company's other accrued liabilities consisted of the following as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  :

  The Company s long-term debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  : 

2016 Transactions 
    
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company repurchased   $7.0 million   outstanding principal of its   8.875%   Senior Notes due 2019 (the  Senior Notes ) in the open market for   $7.0 million  , plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a   $0.2 million   loss on extinguishment of debt, consisting of the write-off of unamortized discount on debt, the write-off of debt issuance costs and payment of premium on the repurchase.

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company repaid   $35.0 million   of its senior secured revolving credit facility. On June 30, 2016, the Company refinanced its senior secured revolving credit facility. See "2016 Credit Facility" below for more information. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company redeemed   $90.0 million   aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to   102.219%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company used   $34.0 million   of existing cash, a   $50.0 million   term loan and   $10.0 million   under its senior secured revolving credit facility to fund the redemption, call premium and accrued interest. The Company recognized a   $4.3 million   loss on extinguishment of debt, consisting of the write-off of unamortized discount on debt, the write-off of debt issuance costs and payment of premium on the repurchase.  
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   $0.4 million   outstanding principal of its Senior Notes in the open market for   $0.4 million  , plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
    
  The above losses are included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The payment of premiums is included in repayment of debt and capital lease obligations in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The indenture governing the Company's   7.375%   Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  Senior Secured Notes ) includes covenants which, subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make certain types of restricted payments, create liens, transfer and sell assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, issue or sell stock of subsidiaries, engage in sale-leaseback transactions and create restrictions on dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture), the Company may be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at   101%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes also contains customary events of default. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

  The indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes contain covenants regarding the Company's ability to make Restricted Payments (as defined in the indentures), including certain dividends, stock purchases, debt repayments and investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the indentures governing the Company's Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes permitted approximately   $197.5 million   and   $325.8 million  , respectively, in Restricted Payments. The Company's ability to make Restricted Payments varies over time, and is determined, in part, by the extent that the Company's cumulative EBITDA exceeds   300%   of its cumulative interest expense. 
    
  2016 Credit Facility 
    
  General.   In June 2016, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) providing for a new senior secured revolving credit facility with aggregate revolving commitments of up to   $125.0 million   and an up to   $50.0 million   delayed draw senior secured term loan (together, the "Credit Facility"). The senior secured revolving credit facility replaces the Company s previous   $135.0 million   senior secured credit facility. The Company paid   $2.5 million   of transaction fees and expenses related to the new Credit Facility, which are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Credit Facility using the straight-line method. The payment of transaction fees is included in proceeds (payments) from issuance of debt, net of issuance costs, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company wrote-off   $0.2 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the previous   $135.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility. The loss is included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Commitment fees and borrowing costs under this facility vary and are based on the Company s most recent Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s commitment fee was   0.5%   and the Company s borrowing cost is LIBOR plus   3.25%   for LIBOR Rate Loans and the Base Rate plus   2.25%   for Base Rate Loans. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.4 million   of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement s Letter of Credit Sublimit. 
    
  The amended and restated credit facility matures on June 30, 2021 and all amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable in full, except that if the Company's Senior Secured Notes have not been repaid in full by February 29, 2020, the maturity date will be February 29, 2020. The term loan is subject to quarterly amortization of principal, commencing with the first fiscal quarter ending after the term loan is funded, as set forth as follows with the remaining outstanding principal amount (and any accrued and unpaid interest) due on February 29, 2020: Year 1, 5.0%; Year 2, 5.0%; Year 3, 7.5%, Year 4, 7.5%; and Year 5, 10.0%. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made quarterly principal payments of   $0.6 million   on the term loan. 
    
  The Credit Facility may in the future be increased by up to   $50.0 million   (so long as the aggregate amount of the Credit Facility does not exceed   $175.0 million  ) with additional commitments from the current lenders or other financial institutions reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent and the satisfaction of conditions contained in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  The Company is the borrower under the Credit Facility. All obligations of the borrower under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of the Company s existing direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company s future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (other than immaterial subsidiaries). The obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors under the Credit Facility, as well as obligations under any treasury management, interest protection or other hedging arrangements entered into with a lender (or affiliate thereof), are secured by (subject to certain liens permitted by the Credit Agreement) liens, which rank equally with the Company s other senior secured indebtedness, on and security interests in, (i) substantially all of the Company s and the subsidiary guarantors  present and future personal property assets (subject to certain exclusions set forth in the Credit Agreement), (ii) certain of the Company s and the subsidiary guarantors  present and future real estate owned in fee simple that is required by the Credit Agreement to be mortgaged, (iii) all present and future shares of the capital stock of the Company s and the subsidiary guarantors  present and future subsidiaries (excluding any stock in excess of 66% of the voting stock of non-U.S. subsidiaries), and (iv) all proceeds and products of the foregoing property and assets. 
    
  Prepayment  . The Company may prepay the Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders  breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of LIBOR borrowings. The Company may irrevocably reduce or terminate the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility at any time without penalty. 
    
  Covenants  . The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, covenants and events of default with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries that are customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities. The negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement include restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, incur liens on assets, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions or divestitures, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay certain other indebtedness (including certain prepayments of the Company s senior secured notes and senior notes), enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments, and change the nature of their businesses, and amend the terms of certain other indebtedness (including the Company s existing notes), in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 (with restrictions on cash netting) and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Financial Information Under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X 
    
  The Company s Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries, other than certain subsidiaries that are minor (the  Guarantor Subsidiaries ).  All of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are   100%   owned by the Company and have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, to each holder of the Notes, the full and prompt performance of the Company s obligations under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes, including the payment of principal (or premium, if any) and interest on the Notes, on an equal and ratable basis. Further, the Company has no independent assets or operations, and there are no significant restrictions on the ability of its consolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.

  Dividends 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , cash dividends declared were   $0.15   and   $0.15   per common share, respectively. The Company also pays cash dividend amounts on each outstanding restricted stock unit to be paid at the time the restricted stock unit vests. Cash dividend amounts are forfeited if the restricted stock units do not vest. Total dividend payments were   $21.2 million   and   $16.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , respectively. The decision to declare future dividends is made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Company s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, investment opportunities and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, the agreements governing the Company s Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes and the Company's Credit Agreement contain restrictions on the amount of dividends the Company can pay. 

10.  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense was   $3.6 million   and   $4.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , respectively, and   $10.9 million   and   $12.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , respectively.

Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The following table presents restricted stock unit activity as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of EarthLink s common stock on the grant date. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016   was   $4.53   and   $5.23  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $22.4 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.9 years  . The total fair value of shares vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016   was   $8.6 million   and   $13.1 million  , respectively, which represents the closing price of the Company s common stock on the vesting date multiplied by the number of restricted stock units that vested.

11.  Restructuring, Acquisition and Integration-Related Costs 
    
  Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs consisted of the following during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs consist of costs related to the Company's restructuring, acquisition and integration-related activities. The Company recognizes a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred. The Company recognizes severance costs when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs include the following:  

Integration-related costs, such as system conversion and integration-related consulting and employee costs. The Company is also undertaking a long-term network optimization project designed to consolidate traffic onto network facilities operated by the Company and reduce the usage of other carriers  networks. Integration-related costs associated with this initiative include costs to migrate traffic to lower cost circuits and to terminate existing contracts prior to their expiration; 
                
    Severance, retention and other employee termination costs associated with acquisition and integration activities and as a result of evaluations of our operating structure;  
                
    Facility-related costs, such as lease termination and asset impairments; and 
                
    Transaction-related costs, which are direct costs incurred to effect a business combination, such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional fees. 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $2.5 million   of restructuring costs in connection with changes in its business strategy. The restructuring costs consisted of   $2.1 million   of severance due to reductions in workforce and   $0.4 million   of facilities-related costs primarily due to the closing of certain sales offices and other facilities. Restructuring costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are included in restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
    
  The following table summarizes activity for liability balances associated with facility exit and restructuring liabilities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $5.4 million   of facility exit and restructuring liabilities were classified within current liabilities and   $3.7 million   were classified as other long-term liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.1 million   of facility exit and restructuring liabilities were classified within current liabilities and   $2.4 million   were classified as other long-term liabilities.

12.  Income Taxes 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an income tax provision of   $1.5 million  , resulting in an effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of approximately   10.8%  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded an income tax provision of   $2.8 million  , resulting in an effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of approximately   (10.0)%  . 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily relates to changes in the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The income tax provision for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes federal alternative minimum tax expense, tax expense for foreign and state taxes, amortization of intangibles with indefinite useful lives and a discrete expense of   $0.1 million  , primarily for accrued interest on uncertain tax positions and state taxes. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily relates to changes in the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The income tax benefit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes tax expense for foreign and state taxes, amortization of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and a discrete expense primarily for the recording of an uncertain tax position of   $1.9 million  , including applicable interest, related to certain tax positions that the Company had taken in prior years. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a valuation allowance of   $343.1 million   against its net deferred tax assets, exclusive of its deferred tax liabilities with indefinite useful lives. The Company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. Should the Company s assessment change in a future period it may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance at such time, which would result in a deferred tax benefit in the period of adjustment. 

13.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
    
  The estimated fair value of the Company s Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes was determined based on Level 2 input using observable market prices in less active markets. The carrying amount of the Company s senior secured term loan and senior secured revolving credit facility approximated its fair value as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . The following table presents the fair value of the Company s debt, excluding capital leases, as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  :

14.  Segment Information 
    
  General  
    
  The Company reports segment information along the same lines that its Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews its operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that are aligned around distinct customer categories to optimize operations. The Company operates the following   four   reportable segments: 

Enterprise/Mid-Market  . The Company s Enterprise/Mid-Market segment provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to distributed multi-site business customers. 

Small Business  . The Company s Small Business segment provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to small, often single-site business customers. 

Carrier/Transport  . The Company s Carrier/Transport segment provides transmission capacity and other data, voice and managed network services to telecommunications carriers and large enterprises. 

Consumer  . The Company s Consumer segment provides nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers.  
       
  Segment Results 
    
  The following table presents segment results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  :

The following table presents a reconciliation of segment gross margin to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

The Company evaluates performance of its segments based on segment gross margin. Segment gross margin includes revenues from external customers and related cost of revenues. Costs excluded from segment gross margin include selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs, gain on sale of business, interest expense and other, net, and loss on extinguishment of debt, as they are not considered in the measurement of segment performance. Management periodically evaluates the segmentation of customers within the distinct customer categories, which may result in changes to segment information in the future. 
    
  The Company manages its working capital on a consolidated basis and does not allocate long-lived assets to segments. In addition, segment assets are not reported to, or used by, the Chief Operating Decision Maker and therefore, total segment assets and expenditures for additions of long-lived assets have not been disclosed. 
    
  The Company has not provided information about geographic segments because substantially all of the Company s revenues, results of operations and identifiable assets are in the United States. 
    
  Revenues by Type  
    
  The Company generates revenues by providing a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to business and residential customers. The Company s revenues primarily consist of  the following: 

Monthly recurring charges for providing data, voice and managed network services; transmission capacity; and Internet access and related value-added services; 
                
    Usage revenues;  
                
    Equipment revenues; and  
                
    Non-recurring and other revenues, such as installation fees, termination fees and administrative fees.

15. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal proceedings and other disputes 
    
  General  . The Company is party to various legal proceedings and other disputes arising in the normal course of business, including, but not limited to, regulatory audits, E911 payments, trademark and patent infringement, billing disputes, rights of access, tax, consumer protection, employment and tort. The Company accrues for such matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and there is a range of expected loss for which no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount, the Company accrues at the low end of the range. The Company reviews its accruals each reporting period.  
  The Company's management believes that there are no disputes, litigation or other legal proceedings, audits or disputes asserted or pending against the Company that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and believes that adequate provision for any probable and estimable losses has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, the ultimate result of any current or future litigation or other legal proceedings, audits or disputes is inherently unpredictable and could result in liabilities that are higher than currently predicted.   
  Regulatory audits  . The Company is subject to regulatory audits in the ordinary course of business with respect to various matters, including audits by local municipalities for E911 charges and audits by the Universal Service Administrative Company on universal service fund assessments and payments.  These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if the Company's positions are not accepted by the auditing entity. The Company's financial statements contain reserves for certain of such potential liabilities.  
  Billing disputes  . The Company is periodically involved in disputes related to its billings to other carriers for access to its network. The Company does not recognize revenue related to such matters until the period that revenues are determinable and it is reasonably assured of the collection of the amounts billed. In the event that a claim is made related to revenues previously recognized, the Company assesses the validity of the claim and adjusts the amount of revenue being recognized to the extent that the claim adjustment is considered probable and estimable. The Company recognized   $1.2 million   of net favorable disputes related to its billings to other carriers during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and   $4.3 million   and   $1.6 million   of net favorable disputes related to its billings to other carriers during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, which are included in revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
  The Company periodically disputes network access charges that it is assessed by other companies with which the Company interconnects. The Company maintains adequate reserves for anticipated exposure associated with these billing disputes. The reserves are subject to changes in estimates and management judgment as new information becomes available. In view of the length of time historically required to resolve these disputes, they may be resolved or require adjustment in future periods and relate to costs invoiced, accrued or paid in prior periods. While the Company believes its reserves for billing disputes are adequate, it is reasonably possible that the Company could record additional expense of up to   $9.6 million   for unrecorded disputed amounts. The Company recognized   $3.3 million   and   $3.6 million   for favorable disputes with telecommunication vendors during the three months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , respectively,   $9.9 million   and   $11.1 million   for favorable disputes with

telecommunication vendors during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , respectively, which are included in cost of revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  
  Regulation 
  The Company's services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation. These regulations are subject to ongoing proceedings at federal and state administrative agencies or within state and federal judicial systems. Results of these proceedings could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which the Company operates. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their effect on the Company's industry generally or upon the Company specifically.  
   
  16. Subsequent Event 
    
  On November 5, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Windstream Holdings, Inc. ( Windstream ) under which the Company and Windstream will merge in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately   $1.1 billion  . Under the terms of the merger agreement, EarthLink s shareholders will receive   0.818   shares of Windstream common stock for each EarthLink share owned. Upon closing of the transaction, Windstream shareholders will own approximately   51%   and EarthLink shareholders will own approximately   49%   of the combined company. The transaction is subject to approval by EarthLink and Windstream shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first half of 2017.

  Overview 
    
  EarthLink Holdings Corp. ( EarthLink  or the  Company ), together with our consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider to business and residential customers in the United States. We provide a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers. We also provide nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. We operate an extensive network including more than 29,000 route miles of fiber and 90 metro fiber rings. Through our owned and leased facilities, we provide data and voice IP service coverage across more than 90 percent of the United States. We operate   four   reportable segments aligned around distinct customer categories: Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business, Carrier/Transport and Consumer.  
    
  General Developments in our Business 
    
  Key developments in our business during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are described below: 

Generated revenues of   $729.7 million  , a   13%   decrease compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by declines in traditional voice and data products for business and consumer services and the sale of our IT services business, as further discussed below. These declines were partially offset by increased sales of our growth products, targeted price increases and successful efforts to re-term customers coming out of contract. 

Reduced cost of revenues   11%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period, primarily related to the decline in revenues noted above as well as successful efforts to manage cost of revenues through network grooming, auditing telecommunications vendor invoices and other cost saving initiatives. 

Generated net income of   $12.2 million  , compared to a net loss of   $30.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, a decrease in interest expense due to lower outstanding debt, a decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt due to fewer debt repurchases and a   $9.1 million   pretax gain recognized on our sale of businesses. Partially offsetting these declines was a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA as described below. 

Generated Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure, see  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  in this Item 2) of   $168.8 million  , a decrease from   $188.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the decrease in revenues from traditional voice and data products, offset by improvements in our cost of revenues and operating expenses. The decrease in cost of revenues and operating expenses was driven by cost savings initiatives, including reductions in workforce implemented over the past year. 

Repurchased $97.4 million of outstanding principal amount of debt and repaid $35.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

( Windstream ) under which EarthLink and Windstream will merge in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately   $1.1 billion  . Under the terms of the merger agreement, EarthLink s shareholders will receive   0.818   shares of Windstream common stock for each EarthLink share owned. Upon closing of the transaction, Windstream shareholders will own approximately   51%   and EarthLink shareholders will own approximately   49%   of the combined company. The transaction is subject to approval by EarthLink and Windstream shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first half of 2017. 
    
  Sale of IT Services Business 
    
  In February 2016, we sold certain assets related to our IT services product offerings in connection with our strategy to simplify our operations and provide more flexibility to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth in our core business. The purchase price in the transaction was $29.6 million, subject to post-closing contingencies that could increase or decrease the purchase price by up to   $5.0 million  . We received $26.6 million of cash. The other $3.0 million of consideration was deposited into an escrow account to fund potential indemnification obligations. We recognized a pretax gain of $6.3 million and recorded a   $2.0 million   deferred gain for contingent consideration. The loss of revenues related to our IT services product offerings has contributed and will continue to contribute to our anticipated revenue declines in 2016. 
    
  Acquisition of Boston Retail Partners 
    
  In July 2016, we acquired Boston Retail Partners, LLC ( BRP ), a privately-held management consulting firm focused on the retail industry, for initial consideration of approximately $11.2 million, plus possible earn-out payments which could increase the purchase price by up to   $5.6 million  . The primary purpose of the transaction was to provide additional professional services capabilities in connection with our strategy to to be a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider for  multi-location retail and service businesses. We believe the acquisition will provide a growth opportunity for us by enabling us to enhance our support of retailers in creating and implementing customized strategies using our professional services. 
    
  Credit Facility Refinancing and Partial Debt Redemption  
    
  In June 2016, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility, which reduced the capacity from $135.0 million to $125.0 million, provided for an up to $50.0 million delayed draw senior secured term loan and extended the term through June 2021 (except that if our 7.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 have not been repaid in full by February 2020, the term will be February 2020). In August 2016, we redeemed $90.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.875% Senior Notes due 2019 at a redemption price equal to 102.219% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We used approximately $34.0 million of existing cash, $50.0 million under our term loan and $10.0 million of our revolving credit facility to fund the redemption, call premium and accrued interest.  
    
  Business Strategy 
    
  Our business strategy is to be a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider for multi-location retail and service businesses. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for managed network, security and cloud services due to the changing technological and business landscape, which is experiencing increased demand for data, evolving security threats, a shift towards more software based solutions, increased use of outsourcing and tightening budgets. We are positioning our company to focus on this opportunity. The key elements of our business strategy and transformation are as follows: 

Operate each of our business units with focused, value-optimizing strategies.   Our organization is aligned around four distinct business units, which are Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business, Carrier/Transport and Consumer. We believe this concentrates our resources and investments into areas that will drive growth and deliver improved performance, enable each business to compete more successfully in the market and provide strategic optionality. We are focused on operating each business unit with value-optimizing strategies, which are managing the decline in our Small Business and Consumer business units and investing the cash flow to grow our Enterprise/Mid-Market and Carrier/Transport business units.

     Table of Contents  

Optimize our cost structure and cash flows.   We are focused on optimizing our cost structure and maximizing our cash flows. This includes managing our cost of revenues and operating expenses, streamlining our internal processes and aligning our workforce to current revenue trends. It also includes the repayment and/or refinancing of debt in order to reduce our interest expense. We plan to use the cash flow generated from our improvement efforts to continue to optimize our balance sheet and invest in growth. 

Invest in growth business products, marketing and sales.   Our growth business products include MultiProtocol Label Switching ("MPLS"), hosted voice and other UCaaS products, software-defined wide area network ("SD-WAN"), Hybrid WAN and managed network, security and cloud services for multi-location businesses and transport services for other communications carriers and enterprises. We are focused on investing in product and service capabilities and sales and marketing initiatives to support our growth products.  

Evaluate potential strategic transactions.   We continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions in order to accelerate our transformation. We believe that targeted acquisitions, when available at the right economics, can be an effective means for growth and targeted capability building. In addition, we continue to evaluate our business, which could lead us to discontinue or divest non-strategic products, assets or customers based on management's assessment of their strategic value to our business.  
       
  Challenges and Risks 
    
  The primary challenges we face in executing on our business strategy are growing revenues from our growth products and services; reducing churn in our existing customer base; responding to competition; aligning costs with trends in our revenues; and ensuring adequate resources to invest in growth. To address these challenges we are taking the following actions: 

Targeting larger multi-location retail and service businesses which have lower churn profiles, as well as a need for our product and services 
                
    Investing in new products and service capabilities to create value for our customers, in particular our cloud-based offerings and SD-WAN 
                
    Focusing on customer contract re-term efforts, retention offers, targeted price increases and opportunities to upsell products and services 
                
    Improving the customer experience to increase customer satisfaction and further enhance customer retention 
                
    Continuing to refine and narrow our product portfolio 
                
    Implementing cost efficiencies, such as network grooming, workforce alignment and facility closings, and seeking to make costs more variable 
                
    Repaying and/or refinancing outstanding indebtedness in order to reduce interest expense 
                
    Considering further divestitures of non-strategic products, assets or customers in order to continue to simplify our operations and generate cash to reduce debt or to use for other strategic needs 
                
    Evaluating potential strategic transactions to add products and services 
       
  Trends in our Business 
    
  Our financial results are impacted by several significant trends, which are described below.  

Industry factors  . The communications industry is characterized by intense competition, changing technology and changes in customer needs, an evolving regulatory environment and industry consolidation resulting in larger competitors and fewer suppliers. We expect these trends to continue. More recently, trends in the industry have included increased demand for data, evolving security threats, the adoption of cloud computing and the increased use of outsourcing. We are trying to capitalize on these changes by focusing on our managed network, security and cloud services and transport services. 
                
    Traditional business voice and data products  .     Our traditional business voice and data revenues have been declining due to competition, migration to more advanced integrated voice and data services and mandated rate reductions. We expect this trend to continue. We have also experienced an increase in churn for these products. However, we are focused on decelerating these declines through customer retention efforts, contract renewals, upselling products and services and offering new services.  
                
    Consumer access declines  . Our consumer access subscriber base and revenues have been declining and are expected to continue to decline due to the continued maturation of the market for Internet access, competition from cable, DSL and wireless providers and limited sales and marketing activities. In addition, we have implemented, and expect to continue to implement, targeted price increases, which could negatively impact our churn rates. In July 2016, we sold approximately  
     
   21 

     Table of Contents  

12,000 customer relationships to one of our network providers, which will also cause our consumer access subscriber base and revenues to decrease. However, we are focused on customer retention and, as a result, we expect the rate of churn to continue to generally decline as our customer base becomes longer tenured. We also recently launched Hyperlink high-speed Internet service that offers service at faster speeds than traditional DSL.  
             
    Operating costs and expenses  . We have experienced declines in cost of revenues and operating expense due to various cost saving initiatives, lower sales of traditional voice and data products and customer churn. We are focused on continuing to optimize our cost structure to offset pressures on revenue. However, we may not be able to continue to achieve the level of cost savings we have been experiencing and there will be decreasing opportunities for cost savings in the future. 
                
    Dispute settlements.   Due to the nature of our industry, we are regularly involved in disputes related to our billings to other carriers for access to our network and network access charges that we are assessed by other companies. The disputes often take significant time to resolve, and they may be resolved or require adjustment in future periods although they relate to costs and revenues in prior periods. We have experienced an increase in dispute settlements impacting revenues and cost of revenues over the past few years. However, this trend may not continue at the rate it has historically.

Revenues 
    
  We generate revenues by providing a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to business and residential customers.  
  Our revenues primarily consist of the following: 

Monthly recurring charges for providing data, voice and managed network services; transmission capacity; and Internet access and related value-added services; 
                
    Usage revenues;  
                
    Equipment revenues; and  
                
    Non-recurring and other revenues, such as installation fees, termination fees and administrative fees.  
       
  The following table presents revenue detail for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

The following table presents the primary reasons for the change in revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods: 

______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Decrease primarily due to decline in traditional voice and data products, including traditional voice, lower-end, single site broadband services and web hosting. Revenues for these voice and data products have been decreasing due to an increase in customer churn, competition and a deemphasis on certain traditional products. Partially offsetting the decline in revenues for our traditional voice and data products were efforts to protect our revenue base, such as targeted price increases implemented during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and re-terms of customers coming out of contract.  
              (b) 
    Decrease in IT services revenues primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to our IT services product offerings on February 1, 2016. Also contributing to the decrease prior to the sale in February 2016 was the discontinuance of certain products that were low margin revenue streams or that were not consistent with our more focused business strategy. 
              (c) 
    Decrease primarily due to the continued maturation of the market for Internet access, competitive pressures in the industry and limited sales and marketing activities. Also contributing to the decrease was the sale of approximately 12,000 customer relationships to one of our network providers in July 2016. 
              (d) 
    Decrease primarily due to decline in traditional voice and data products due to an increase in customer churn, competition and a deemphasis on certain traditional products. Over the past year we deemphasized and discontinued certain products that were low margin revenue streams or that were not consistent with our more focused business strategy. Partially offsetting the decline in revenues for our traditional voice and data products were price increases implemented during  
     
   23 

     Table of Contents  

the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and an increase in sales of growth products, including MPLS, hosted voice, managed network services and transport revenues due to an increased emphasis on selling these products and services.  
           (e) 
    Increase due to the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of BRP beginning in July 2016. The revenues are included within non-recurring and other revenues in our Enterprise/Mid-Market segment. 
              (f) 
    Increase primarily due to an increase in transport revenues as we capitalize on unique fiber routes. Also contributing to the increase was a change in settlements and disputes related to billings to other carriers, as we recognized net unfavorable settlements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and favorable settlements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Cost of revenues 
    
  Cost of revenues primarily consists of the cost of connecting customers to our networks via leased facilities; the costs of leasing components of our network facilities; costs paid to third-party providers for interconnect access and transport services; fees paid to suppliers of our value-added services; fees paid to content providers for information provided on our online properties; and the cost of equipment sold to customers.

The following table presents the primary reasons for the change in cost of revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods: 

______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Decrease due to decline in revenues and a concentrated effort to manage cost of revenues through auditing telecommunications vendor invoices and other cost saving initiatives and declines in traditional voice and data products. Partially offsetting these declines were increased sales of growth products.  
              (b) 
    Decrease due to a concentrated effort to manage cost of revenues through network grooming and other cost saving initiatives and declines in traditional voice and data products. Partially offsetting these declines were increased sales of growth products.  
              (c) 
    Decrease due to declines in traditional voice and data products and a decreased emphasis on selling certain lower margin products and services. 
              (d) 
    Decrease in IT services cost of revenues primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to our IT services product offerings on February 1, 2016. Also contributing to the decrease prior to the sale in February 2016 was the discontinuance of certain products that had low margins or that were not consistent with our more focused business strategy. 
              (e) 
    Increase due to the inclusion of cost of revenues from our acquisition of BRP beginning in July 2016. 
              (f) 
    Increase primarily due to fewer favorable adjustments and settlements during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Selling, general and administrative 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses related to sales and marketing, customer service, network operations, information technology, regulatory, billing and collections, corporate administration, and legal and accounting. Such costs include salaries and related employee costs (including stock-based compensation), outsourced labor, professional fees, property taxes, travel, insurance, occupancy costs, advertising and other administrative expenses.

The following table presents the primary reasons for the change in selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods: 

______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Decrease in people costs as employee headcount decreased from 2,144 full-time equivalents as of   September 30, 2015   to 1,902 full-time equivalents as of   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to reductions in workforce over the past year driven by changes in our business strategy and the transfer of employees in connection with the sale of IT services business on February 1, 2016. 
              (b) 
    Decrease in rent and occupancy costs primarily due to cost savings from the closing of several sales offices and other properties over the past year in connection with changes to our business strategy. 
              (c) 
    Decrease in outside sales commissions primarily due to lower sales volume. 
              (d) 
    Decrease in bad debt expense due to more effective collection efforts and the overall decrease in revenues. 
              (e) 
    Decrease in other selling, general and administrative costs such as commissions, outsourced labor, payment processing, travel and insurance due to increased focus on optimizing our cost structure.  
              (f) 
    Increase due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses from our acquisition of BRP beginning in July 2016.

Depreciation and amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets acquired in purchases of businesses and purchases of customer bases from other companies.  
    
  The following table presents depreciation and amortization expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

The decreases in depreciation expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures, the sale of property and equipment related to our IT services business on February 1, 2016 and assets becoming fully amortized over the year. The decreases in amortization expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to definite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized over the year and the sale of customer relationships and developed technology related to our IT services business on February 1, 2016, partially offset by amortization expense resulting from the definite-lived intangible assets obtained in our acquisition of BRP on July 13, 2016. 
    
  Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs 
    
  Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs consist of costs related to our restructuring, acquisition and integration-related activities. Such costs include the following:  

Integration-related costs, such as system conversion and integration-related consulting and employee costs. We are also undertaking a long-term network optimization project designed to consolidate traffic onto network facilities operated by us and reduce the usage of other carriers  networks. Integration-related costs associated with this initiative include costs to migrate traffic to lower cost circuits and to terminate existing contracts prior to their expiration;  
                
    Severance, retention and other employee termination costs associated with acquisition and integration activities and with certain voluntary employee separations; and  
                
    Facility-related costs, such as lease termination and asset impairments; and 
                
    Transaction-related costs, which are direct costs incurred to effect a business combination, such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional fees. 
       
  The following table presents restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

26 

     Table of Contents  

The decreases in restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to decreases in severance, retention and other employee costs due to fewer reductions in workforce in the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods and a decrease in facility-related costs due to fewer sales office and other facility closures. This was partially offset by an increase in integration-related costs related to our network optimization projects. 
    
  Gain on sale of businesses 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a pretax gain of $6.3 million on the sale of certain assets related to our IT services product offerings. The primary purpose of the sale was to simplify operations and provide more flexibility to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth in our core business. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we also recorded a pretax gain of $2.8 million on the sale of approximately   12,000   consumer customer relationships to one of our network providers. For more information about these transactions, refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Interest expense and other, net 
    
  Interest expense and other, net, is primarily comprised of interest expense incurred on our debt and capital leases, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts and other miscellaneous income and expense items. 
    
  The following table presents interest expense and other, net, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  :  

The decreases in interest expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to lower outstanding debt resulting from redemptions and repurchases over the past year. As of   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , we had $513.9 million and $435.9 million, respectively, of gross amount of debt outstanding (excluding capital leases). For more information about our debt transactions, refer to Note 7 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Loss on extinguishment of debt 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , we redeemed and repurchased $126.1 million and $97.4 million, respectively, outstanding principal of our 8.875% Senior Notes due 2019 and recorded   $9.7 million   and   $4.8 million  , respectively, for losses on extinguishment of debt. The losses consisted of premiums paid on our repurchases and redemptions, the write-off of unamortized discount on debt and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. For more information about our debt transactions, refer to Note 7 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Income tax provision 
    
  The income tax provision of   $1.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   represents an effective rate of 10.8%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily relates to changes in the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The income tax provision for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes federal Alternative Minimum Tax expense, tax expense for foreign and state taxes, amortization of intangibles with indefinite useful lives, and a discrete expense of $0.1 million primarily for accrued interest on uncertain tax positions and state taxes. The income tax provision of   $2.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   represents an effective rate of (10.0)%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate primarily relates to changes in the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The tax provision for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes tax expense for foreign and state taxes, amortization of intangibles with indefinite useful lives and a discrete expense primarily for the recording of an uncertain tax position of $1.9 million, including applicable interest, related to certain tax positions that we had taken during prior years. 

27 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had deferred tax assets of approximately   $338.6 million  , of which   $259.3 million   relates to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. EarthLink maintains a valuation allowance of   $343.1 million   against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of our deferred tax liabilities with indefinite useful lives. We continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. Should our assessment change in a future period we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance at such time, which would result in a deferred tax benefit in the period of adjustment. 
    
  To the extent we report income in future periods, we intend to use our net operating loss carryforwards to the extent available to offset taxable income and reduce cash outflows for income taxes. Our ability to use our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal and state tax credit carryforwards may be subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions in the future resulting from changes in ownership as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. 
    
  Segment Results of Operations 
    
  We report segment information along the same lines that our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are strategic business units that are aligned around distinct customer categories to optimize operations. We believe this structure allows for better management accountability and decision making while providing greater visibility to our Chief Operating Decision Maker. We operate the following four reportable segments: 

Enterprise/Mid-Market  . Our Enterprise/Mid-Market segment provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to distributed multi-site business customers. 

Small Business  . Our Small Business segment provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to small, often single-site business customers. 

Carrier/Transport  . Our Carrier/Transport segment provides transmission capacity and other data, voice and managed network services to telecommunications carriers and large enterprises.  

Consumer  . Our Consumer segment provides nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers.  

We evaluate performance of our segments based on segment gross margin. Segment gross margin includes revenues from external customers and related cost of revenues. Costs excluded from segment gross margin include selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs, gain on sale of business, interest expense and other, net, and loss on extinguishment of debt, as they are not considered in the measurement of segment performance. Management periodically evaluates the segmentation of customers within the distinct customer categories, which may result in changes to segment information in the future.

     Table of Contents  

The decreases in Enterprise/Mid-Market revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the following: 

Decrease of $7.7 million and $21.1 million in IT services revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods, respectively, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to our IT services product offerings on February 1, 2016, as well as the discontinuance of certain products that had low margins or that were not consistent with our more focused business strategy.  
                
    Decrease in traditional voice and data products. Revenues for traditional voice and data products have been decreasing due to an increase in customer churn, competition and a deemphasis on certain traditional products.  
                
    Partially offset by targeted price increases implemented during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and increased sales of our growth products, including MPLS, hosted voice and managed network services. 
                
    Partially offset by an increase of $2.3 million during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of BRP beginning in July 2016. 
       
  The decreases in Enterprise/Mid-Market cost of revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the decline in revenues noted above as well as successful efforts to manage cost of revenues through network grooming, auditing telecommunications vendor invoices and other cost saving initiatives. This was partially offset by an increase due to the inclusion of cost of revenues from our acquisition of BRP beginning in July 2016.

The decreases in Small Business revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the following:  

Decrease in traditional voice and data products. Revenues for traditional voice and data products have been decreasing due to an increase in customer churn, competition and a deemphasis on certain traditional products.  
                
    Decrease of $3.7 million and $10.3 million in IT services revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods, respectively, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to our IT services product offerings on February 1, 2016, as well as the discontinuance of certain products that had low margins or that were not consistent with our more focused business strategy.  
                
    Partially offset by efforts to protect our revenue base, such as targeted price increases and re-terms of customers coming out of contract. 
       
  The decreases in Small Business cost of revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the decline in revenues noted above as well as successful efforts to manage cost of revenues through network grooming, auditing telecommunications vendor invoices and other cost saving initiatives.

Carrier/Transport Segment Results 
    
  The following table sets forth operating results for our Carrier/Transport segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

The increases in Carrier/Transport revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to an increase in transport revenues as we capitalize on unique fiber routes. Also contributing to the increases was a change in settlements and disputes related to billings to other carriers, as we recognized net unfavorable settlements during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and favorable settlements during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in legacy products and services.  
    
  The increases in Carrier/Transport cost of revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to an increase in usage volume and the increase in transport revenues. 
    
  Consumer Segment Results 
    
  Consumer Operating Results 
    
  The following table sets forth operating results for our Consumer segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

We classify our Consumer segment revenue in two categories: (1) access services, which includes dial-up and high-speed Internet access services; and (2) value-added services, which includes revenues from ancillary services sold as add-on features to our Internet access services, such as security products, premium email, home networking and email storage; search revenues; and advertising revenues.  
    
  The decreases in Consumer revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the following:   

Decrease in average consumer subscribers, which were   0.8 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   0.7 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease resulted from limited sales and marketing activities, the continued maturation of the market for Internet access and competitive pressures in the industry. Also contributing was the sale of approximately 12,000 customer relationships to one of our network providers in July 2016. However, as we continue to focus on the retention of customers, our monthly consumer subscriber churn rates improved from   1.7%   and   1.9%   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, to   1.6%   and   1.7%   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which moderated the decline in  
     
   31 

     Table of Contents  

average consumer subscribers. We also recently launched Hyperlink high speed Internet service that offers service at faster speeds than traditional DSL, which offset some of the decline.  

Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in our average revenue per subscriber, which was   $23.48   and   $23.42   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and   $23.76   and   $23.91   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The increases were due to targeted price increases and a change in mix of subscribers.  
       
  The decreases in Consumer cost of revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the following:  

The decrease in average consumer subscribers noted above. 

Partially offset by an increase in our average cost per subscriber. This was due to a shift in the mix to customers with higher costs associated with delivering services and higher unit costs as our agreements with certain service providers generally have volume based tiered pricing which is leading to higher unit costs as our subscriber base decreases.  
       
  Consumer Operating Metrics 
    
  The following table sets forth subscriber and operating data for our Consumer segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 
   
  _________ 
    
  (a) During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we began reporting approximately 19,000 subscribers in our paying subscriber count as a result of price increases implemented during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we began reporting approximately 6,000 subscribers in our paying subscriber count as a result of price increases implemented during the period. These subscribers were previously counted as non-paying subscribers because their monthly fee was below a certain threshold. 
    
  (b) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold approximately 12,000 customer relationships to one of our network providers. 
    
  (c) Subscriber counts do not include new nonpaying customers. Customers receiving service under promotional programs that include periods of free service at inception are not included in subscriber counts until they become paying customers. 

32 

     Table of Contents  

(d) Average subscribers for the three month periods is calculated by averaging the ending monthly subscribers or accounts for the four months preceding and including the end of the period. Average subscribers for the six month periods is calculated by averaging the ending monthly subscribers or accounts for the seven months preceding and including the end of the period.  
    
  (e) ARPU represents the average monthly revenue per user (subscriber). ARPU is computed by dividing revenue for the period by the average number of subscribers for the period. Revenue used to calculate ARPU includes recurring service revenue as well as nonrecurring revenues associated with equipment and other one-time charges associated with initiating or discontinuing services.  
    
  (f) Churn rate is used to measure the rate at which subscribers discontinue service on a voluntary or involuntary basis.  Churn rate is computed by dividing the average monthly number of subscribers that discontinued service during the period by the average subscribers for the period. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The following table sets forth summarized cash flow data for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  : 

Operating activities 
    
  The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower revenue, offset by decreases in operating expense, interest payments and restructuring payments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Investing activities 
    
  The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the following: 

$26.6 million of cash received from the sale of our IT services business; 
                
    $3.8 million of cash received from the sale of certain Consumer customer relationships; and 
                
    a   $4.8 million   decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016   primarily related to enhancing our network and technology infrastructure and the acquisition of new customers.  
                
    partially offset by $10.4 million net cash used for our acquisition of BRP. 
       
  Financing activities 
    
  The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period was primarily due the following: 

a   $26.1 million   decrease in repayment of debt primarily on our Senior Notes. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we used $131.3 million to repurchase and redeem our Senior Notes and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used $99.4 million to repurchase and redeem our Senior Notes. This was partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in repayments for our revolving credit facility and $0.6 million used for quarterly principal payments on our term loan. For more information about our debt transactions, refer to Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
                
    a   $4.4 million   decrease in dividends paid primarily due to the timing of the funding of our quarterly dividend payment. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , we declared cash dividends of   $0.15   per share; however, we funded four quarterly payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to three payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     
   33 

     Table of Contents  

partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in proceeds from debt, net of issuance costs. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we received gross proceeds of $70.0 million under our credit facility and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we received gross proceeds of $60.0 million under our credit facility. 
                
    partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in proceeds received for stock option exercises  . 
       
  Future Uses of cash 
    
  Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including the costs required to maintain our network infrastructure, the outcome of various telecommunications-related disputes and proceedings, our product and service capabilities, the level of resources used for our sales and marketing activities, the level of restructuring activities, interest payments on outstanding debt, the costs incurred to redeem or repurchase debt and the size and types of acquisitions in which we may engage, among others. The following is a summary of our primary future cash requirements: 

Debt and interest.   We expect to use cash to service our outstanding indebtedness, including $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes due in June 2020, $76.6 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due in May 2019, $49.4 million principal amount of our term loan and borrowings under our $125.0 million revolving credit facility. We may also use cash to repay outstanding indebtedness. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed and repurchased $97.4 million outstanding principal of our Senior Notes and made $0.6 million of quarterly principal payments on our term loan. We may repurchase or redeem additional debt. 

Capital expenditures  . We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately   $80.0 million   to   $90.0 million   during 2016. The capital expenditures primarily relate to the acquisition of new customers and to maintain and upgrade our network and technology infrastructure. The actual amount of capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors which are difficult to predict and could change significantly over time. Additionally, technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or obsolete equipment. 

Investments in our growth products and services.   We expect to invest cash in sales and marketing efforts and other resources required to support our strategy related to our growth products and services, including our recently launched SD-WAN product. 

Dividends  . We have historically used cash for dividends. The decision to declare future dividends is made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, investment opportunities, restrictions on dividends under the agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.  

Other  . We may also use cash to acquire or invest in other companies or to repurchase common stock. We also expect to use cash for current restructuring liabilities. Payments for restructuring liabilities incurred to date will be funded through operating cash flows. We continue to evaluate our business, including evaluating ways to reduce the cost structure of our business, and may use cash for additional restructuring activities.   
       
  Future sources of cash 
    
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash flow we generate from our operations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  , we generated   $126.1 million   and   $98.5 million   in cash from operations, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $59.0 million   in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unfavorable economic conditions. 
    
  We also have a credit agreement providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility with aggregate revolving commitments of $125.0 million. Our senior secured revolving credit facility terminates in June 2021, and at that time any amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable in full, except that if our Senior Secured Notes have not been repaid in full by February 29, 2020, the maturity date will be February 29, 2020. As of   September 30, 2016  , $10.0 million was outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility.  
    
  Our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our results of operations, are expected to be sufficient to meet our operating expenses, debt service payments, capital requirements and other obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, to increase available liquidity or to fund acquisitions or other strategic activities, we may seek additional financing. We have no commitments for any additional financing and have no lines of credit or similar sources of financing, other than the borrowings available under  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

our credit facility. We cannot be sure that we can obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, through the issuance of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. Additional equity financing may dilute our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may restrict our ability to repurchase common stock or debt, declare and pay dividends, raise future capital and make acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain additional needed financing, it may prohibit us from refinancing existing indebtedness and making acquisitions, capital expenditures and/or investments, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 (with restrictions on cash netting) and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0 in order to borrow under the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect to be in compliance with the maintenance covenants in our credit agreement for the next 12 months. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  The Board of Directors has authorized a total of   $750.0 million   to repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had utilized approximately   $684.3 million   pursuant to the authorizations and had   $65.7 million   available under the current authorization. We may repurchase our common stock from time to time in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s regulations and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In addition, the agreements governing our Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility contain restrictions on our ability to repurchase common stock.

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), management uses certain  non-GAAP financial measures  within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial performance measures used by management are Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow, as discussed below. 
    
  Management believes that these non-GAAP financial performance measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude the effect of non-operational items, such as restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs, gain on sale of business and loss on extinguishment of debt and non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that excluding the effects of certain non-operational and non-cash items enables investors to better understand and analyze the current period s results and provides a better measure of comparability. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. 
    
  There are limitations to using these non-GAAP financial performance measures. Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are not indicative of cash provided by or used in operating activities and may differ from comparable information provided by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, as an alternative to, or more meaningful than measures of financial performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and other, net, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, restructuring, acquisition and  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

integration-related costs, gain on sale of business and loss on extinguishment of debt. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of our business and for strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in incentive compensation arrangements and is a factor in calculating debt covenants. 
    
  Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and other, net, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs, gain on sale of business and loss on extinguishment of debt, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment. Management uses Unlevered Free Cash Flow to evaluate the performance of our business and to assess our ability to fund capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service and repay debt and pay dividends. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as a performance measure, to the most closely related financial measure reported under GAAP for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 and 2016  :

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results 
    
  The Management s Discussion and Analysis and other portions of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include  forward-looking  statements (rather than historical facts) that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Although we believe that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot promise that our expectations will turn out to be correct.

(16) that work stoppages experienced by other communications companies on whom we rely for service could adversely impact our ability to provision and service our customers; (17) that our commercial and alliance arrangements may not be renewed or may not generate expected benefits, which could adversely affect our results of operations; (18) that our consumer business is dependent on the availability of third-party network service providers; (19) that we face significant competition in the Internet access industry that could reduce our profitability; (20) that the continued decline of our consumer access subscribers will adversely affect our results of operations; (21) that lack of regulation governing wholesale Internet service providers could adversely affect our operations; (22) that cyber security breaches could harm our business; (23) that privacy concerns relating to our business could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our services;

(33) that we may be required to recognize impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position; (34) that we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and we may be limited in the use of our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes in the future; (35) that our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to react to changes in our business and industry; (36) that we may require substantial capital to support business growth, and this capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all; (37) that our debt agreements include restrictive covenants, and failure to comply with these covenants could trigger acceleration of payment of outstanding indebtedness; (38) that we may reduce, or cease payment of, quarterly cash dividends; (39) that our stock price may be volatile; (40) that provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other elements of our capital structure could limit our share price and delay a change of control of the company; and (41) that our bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders  flexibility in obtaining a judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations, are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements and risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Part II 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 
    
  The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings and other disputes arising from normal business activities. The Company s management believes that there are no disputes, litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings asserted or pending against the Company that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and believes that adequate provision for any probable and estimable losses has been made in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
    
  (a)             designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be

  which this report is being prepared; 
  (b)             designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial

  over financial reporting; and

  (a)             all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over  
  financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process,  
  summarize and report financial information; and 
    
  (b)             any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role  
  in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
