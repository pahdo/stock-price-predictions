MV OIL TRUST   
   NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Unaudited)   
     
   Note 1 Organization of the Trust   
     
  MV Oil Trust (the  Trust ) is a statutory trust formed on August 3, 2006, under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) among MV Partners, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company ( MV Partners ), as trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the  Trustee ), and Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the  Delaware Trustee ).  
     
  The Trust was created to acquire and hold a term net profits interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders pursuant to a conveyance from MV Partners to the Trust. The term net profits interest represents the right to receive 80% of the net proceeds (calculated as described below in Note 5) from production from the underlying properties (as defined below) (the  net profits interest ). The term net profits interest consists of MV Partners  net interests in all of its oil and natural gas properties located in the Mid-Continent region in the states of Kansas and Colorado (the  underlying properties ). The underlying properties include approximately 1,000 producing oil and gas wells.  
     
  The net profits interest is passive in nature, and the Trustee has no management control over and no responsibility relating to the operation of the underlying properties. The net profits interest entitles the Trust to receive 80% of the net proceeds attributable to MV Partners  interest from the sale of production from the underlying properties during the term of the Trust. The net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of (1) June 30, 2026 or (2) the time when 14.4 million barrels of oil equivalent ( MMBoe ) have been produced from the underlying properties and sold (which amount is the equivalent of 11.5 MMBoe with respect to the Trust s net profits interest), and the Trust will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate.  
     
  The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are similar to the terms it would grant to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with itself and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust.  
     
   Note 2 Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying Condensed Statements of Assets and Trust Corpus as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations.  
     
  The preparation of financial statements requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trustee believes such information includes all the disclosures necessary to make the information presented not misleading. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of the Trustee, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period presented. The financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
   Note 3 Trust Accounting Policies   
     
  The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report Trust receipts by the Trust of the term net profits interest and payments of expenses incurred. The term net profits interest represents the right to receive revenues (oil, gas and natural gas liquid sales) less direct operating expenses (lease operating expenses, lease maintenance, lease overhead, and production and property taxes) and an adjustment for lease equipment costs and lease development expenses (which are capitalized in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )) of the underlying properties times 80%. Actual cash receipts may vary due to timing delays of actual cash receipts from the property operators or purchasers and due to wellhead and pipeline volume balancing agreements or practices. The actual cash distributions of the Trust will be made based on the terms of the conveyance creating the Trust s net profits interest. Expenses of the Trust, which include accounting, engineering, legal and other professional fees, Trustee fees, an administrative fee paid to MV Partners and out-of-pocket expenses, are recognized when paid. Under U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses would be recognized on an accrual basis. Amortization of the investment in net profits interest is recorded on a unit-of-production method in the period in which the cash is received with respect to such production. Such amortization does not reduce distributable income, rather it is charged directly to Trust corpus.  
     
 3   

This comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.  
     
  Investment in the net profits interest was recorded initially at the historical cost of MV Partners and is periodically assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired below its total capitalized cost based on the underlying properties. The Trust will provide a write-down to its investment in the net profits interest if and when total capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization, exceed undiscounted future net revenues attributable to the proved oil and gas reserves of the underlying properties.  
     
  No new accounting pronouncements have been adopted or issued during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that would impact the financial statements of the Trust.  
     
   Note 4 Investment in Net Profits Interest   
     
  The net profits interest was recorded at the historical cost of MV Partners on January 24, 2007, the date of conveyance of the net profits interest to the Trust, and was calculated as follows:  

Note 5 Income from Net Profits Interest   

(1)                                    Excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs reflect expenses and costs incurred by MV Partners during the March through May production period for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and during the September through May production period for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest, lease equipment and development costs are to be deducted when calculating the distributable income to the Trust. 
     
  (2)                                    Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest, MV Partners can reserve up to $1.0 million for future capital expenditures at any time. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, MV Partners did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, MV Partners released $250,000 previously held for future capital expenditures. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, MV Partners did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust. The reserve balance was $750,000 at September 30, 2016 and $1,000,000 at September 30, 2015. 
     
  (3)                                    The income from net profits interest is based upon the cash receipts from MV Partners for the oil and gas production. The revenues from oil production are typically received by MV Partners one month after production; thus, the cash received by the Trust during the three months ended September 30, 2016 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from March 2016 through May 2016 and the cash received by the Trust during the three months ended September 30, 2015 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from March 2015 through May 2015. The cash received by the Trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from September 2015 through May 2016 and the cash received by the Trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from September 2014 through May 2015. 
     
 4   

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, MV Purchasing, LLC, which is majority owned by the indirect equity owners of MV Partners, purchased a majority of the production from the underlying properties. Sales to MV Purchasing, LLC are under short-term arrangements, ranging from one to six months, using market sensitive pricing.  
     
   Note 6 Income Taxes   
     
  The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust and is not required to pay federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made.  
     
   Note 7 Distributions to Unitholders   
     
  MV Partners makes quarterly payments of the net profits interest to the Trust. The Trustee determines for each quarter the amount available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. This distribution is expected to be made on or before the 25th day of the month following the end of each quarter to the Trust unitholders of record on the 15th day of the month following the end of each quarter (or the next succeeding business day). Such amounts will be equal to the excess, if any, of the cash received by the Trust relating to the preceding quarter, over the expenses of the Trust paid during such quarter, subject to adjustments for changes made by the Trustee during such quarter in any cash reserves established for future expenses of the Trust.  
     
  The first quarterly distribution during 2016 was $1,150,000, or $0.10 per Trust unit and was made on January 25, 2016 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of January 15, 2016. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.  
     
  The second quarterly distribution during 2016 was $345,000, or $0.03 per Trust unit, and was made on April 25, 2016 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of April 15, 2016. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016.  
     
  The third quarterly distribution during 2016 was $1,265,000, or $0.11 per Trust unit, and was made on July 25, 2016 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of July 15, 2016. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016.  
     
  The first quarterly distribution during 2015 was $7,015,000, or $0.61 per Trust unit and was made on January 23, 2015 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of January 15, 2015. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.  
     
  The second quarterly distribution during 2015 was $2,932,500, or $0.255 per Trust unit, and was made on April 24, 2015 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of April 15, 2015. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from January 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015.  
     
  The third quarterly distribution during 2015 was $2,300,000, or $0.20 per Trust unit, and was made on July 24, 2015 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of July 16, 2015. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015.  
     
   Note 8 Advance for Trust Expenses   
     
  Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is allowed to borrow money to pay Trust expenses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no borrowings or amounts owed for money borrowed in previous quarters. MV Partners has provided a letter of credit in the amount of $1 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay future expenses.  
     
   Note 9 Subsequent Events   
     
  The fourth quarterly distribution during 2016 was $1,840,000, or $0.16 per Trust unit, and was made on October 25, 2016 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of October 14, 2016. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by MV Partners from July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016.  
     
   Item 2.  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
     
  The following discussion of the Trust s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto. The Trust s purpose is, in general, to hold the net profits interest, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the net profits interest and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the net profits interest and the Trust units. The Trust derives substantially all of its income and cash flows from the net profits interest.  
     
 5   

Results of Operations for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  The cash received by the Trust from MV Partners during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from March 2016 through May 2016. The cash received by the Trust during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from March 2015 through May 2015. The revenues from oil production are typically received by MV Partners one month after production. The Trust s income from net profits interest decreased $1,035,999 to $1,467,044 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $2,503,043 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $1,294,999 decrease in excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs for the underlying properties to $1,833,805 from $3,128,804 for the prior period. These amounts were reduced by a Trust holdback for future expenses of $202,044 and $203,043 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Trustee paid general and administrative expenses of $229,739 and $195,597 for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,  MV Partners did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust.  These factors resulted in distributable income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of $1,265,000, a decrease of $1,035,000 from $2,300,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
     
  The average price received for crude oil sold was $36.29 per Bbl and the average price received for natural gas sold was $1.72 per Mcf for the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. The average price received for crude oil sold was $47.31 per Bbl and the average price received for natural gas sold was $2.20 per Mcf for the period from April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015.  
     
  The overall production sales volumes attributable to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 were 148,350 Bbls of oil, 11,066 Mcf of natural gas and 223 Bbls of natural gas liquids for total barrels of oil equivalent of 150,340. The overall production sales volumes attributable to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015 were 160,782 Bbls of oil, 11,740 Mcf of natural gas and 285 Bbls of natural gas liquids for for total barrels of oil equivalent of 162,924.  
     
   Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  The cash received by the Trust from MV Partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from September 2015 through May 2016. The cash received by the Trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from September 2014 through May 2015. The revenues from oil production are typically received by MV Partners one month after production. The Trust s income from net profits interest decreased $9,430,664 to $3,436,568 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $12,867,232 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $12,100,830 decrease in excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs for the underlying properties to $3,983,210 from $16,084,040 for the prior period. Additionally, the Trustee held back $676,568 for future expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $619,732 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Trustee paid general and administrative expenses of $651,610 and $595,578 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  MV Partners also released $250,000 of the reserve previously held for future capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These factors resulted in distributable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $2,760,000, a decrease of $9,487,500 from $12,247,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  The average price received for crude oil sold was $34.58 per Bbl and the average price received for natural gas sold was $1.85 per Mcf for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.  The average price received for crude oil sold was $57.36 per Bbl and the average price received for natural gas sold was $3.07 per Mcf for the period from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015.  
     
  The overall production sales volumes attributable to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 were 454,029 Bbls of oil, 36,709 Mcf of natural gas and 726 Bbls of natural gas liquids for a total equivalent barrels of oil of 460,619. The overall production sales volumes attributable to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015 were 488,791 Bbls of oil, 34,308 Mcf of natural gas and 533 Bbls of natural gas liquids for a total equivalent barrels of oil of 494,856.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Other than Trust administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the Trust s only use of cash is for distributions to Trust unitholders. Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustee as well as an annual administrative fee to MV Partners pursuant to an administrative services agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the net profits interest and payments from other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) in that quarter, over the Trust s expenses paid for that quarter. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future expenses. As of September 30, 2016, $199,000 was held by the Trustee as such a reserve.  
     
 6   

The Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds required to pay expenses if the Trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust s expenses. If the Trust borrows funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no such borrowings. MV Partners has provided a letter of credit in the amount of $1 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay future expenses.  
     
  Income to the Trust from the net profits interest is based on the calculation and definitions of  gross proceeds  and  net proceeds  contained in the conveyance.  
     
  As substantially all of the underlying properties are located in mature fields, MV Partners does not expect future costs for the underlying properties to change significantly as compared to recent historical costs other than changes due to fluctuations in the general cost of oilfield services. MV Partners may establish a capital reserve of up to $1.0 million in the aggregate at any given time to reduce the impact on distributions of uneven capital expenditure timing. As of September 30, 2016, $750,000 was held by MV Partners as a capital reserve.  
     
  The Trust does not have any transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the Trust s liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  
     
   Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  This Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q, including without limitation the statements under  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  are forward-looking statements. Although MV Partners advised the Trust that it believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations ( Cautionary Statements ) are disclosed in this Form 10-Q and in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Form 10-K ), including under the section  Item 1A. Risk Factors . All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Trust or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the Cautionary Statements.  
     
   Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
     
  The only assets of and sources of income to the Trust are cash and the net profits interest, which generally entitles the Trust to receive 80% of the net proceeds from oil and gas production from the underlying properties. Consequently, the Trust is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Although the Trust may borrow money to pay expenses of the Trust, the amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the Trust. As a result, the Trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk.  
     
   Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   The Trustee maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust is accumulated and communicated by MV Partners to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee of the Trust, and its employees who participate in the preparation of the Trust s periodic reports as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
     
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures. A Trust Officer of the Trustee has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust are effective.  
     
  Due to the contractual arrangements of (i) the Trust Agreement and (ii) the conveyance of the net profits interest, the Trustee relies on (A) information provided by MV Partners, including historical operating data, plans for future operating and capital expenditures, reserve information and information relating to projected production, and (B) conclusions and reports regarding reserves by the Trust s independent reserve engineers. See  Risk Factors The trust and the public trust unitholders have no voting or managerial rights with respect to MV Partners, the operator of the underlying properties. As a result, public trust unitholders have no ability to influence the operation of the underlying properties  and  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relating to these arrangements and reliance on information when reported by MV Partners to the Trustee and recorded in the Trust s results of operations.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there was no change in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. The Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it has no authority over, and makes no statement concerning, the internal control over financial reporting of MV Partners. 
     
   PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   Item 1A.  Risk Factors.   
     
  There have not been any material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Trust s response to Item 1A to Part 1 of the Form 10-K.  
     
   Item 6.  Exhibits.

I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and I have: 
     
  a)                                        Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the Report is being prepared;

  5.                                         I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors: 
     
  a)                                        All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
     
  b)                                        Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves any persons who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
