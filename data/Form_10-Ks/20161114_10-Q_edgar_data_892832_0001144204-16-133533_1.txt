  Notes To Condensed Financial Statements  

  For The Three- and Nine-Month Periods
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation  

Pursuant to a recommendation
of the Company s Board of Directors and approval by its shareholders on January 13, 2004, the Company sold to NC Acquisition
Corporation (the  Purchaser ) on March 31, 2004 all of its tangible and intangible assets, including its real estate,
accounts, equipment, intellectual property, inventory, subsidiaries, goodwill, and other intangibles, except for $30,000 in cash,
(the  Net Asset Sale ). The Purchaser also assumed all of the Company s liabilities pursuant to the Net Asset Sale.
Following the Net Asset Sale, the Company s only remaining assets were $30,000 in cash and it had no liabilities. It also
retained no subsidiaries. On April 1, 2004 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Nematron Corporation
to Sandston Corporation (the  Company ) and to implement a shareholder approved one-for-five reverse stock split of
the Company s common stock, whereby every five issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock became one
share. On April 1, 2004 the Company also sold a total of 5,248,257 post-split shares to Dorman Industries, LLC ( Dorman Industries )
for $50,000. Dorman Industries is a Michigan Limited Liability Company wholly owned by Mr. Daniel J. Dorman, the Company s
Chairman of the Board, President and Principal Accounting Officer. Pursuant to its purchase of these shares, Dorman Industries
became the owner of 62.50% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company. The Company has made subsequent sales of common
stock to Dorman Industries in order to raise cash to pay operating expenses: 2010 - 500,000 shares for $15,000; 2011 - 375,000
shares for $15,000; 2012 - 1,500,000 shares for $15,000; 2013 - 361,766 shares for $10,853; 2014 - 733,300 shares for $21,803;
2015   394,506 shares for $15,780; and 2016 (in February, March, April, July, and August)   482,367 shares for $16,975.
Dorman Industries currently is the beneficial owner of 63.36% of the Company s outstanding common stock. 

Effective April 1,
2004, the Company became a  public shell  corporation. The Company intends to build long-term shareholder value by acquiring
and/or investing in and operating strategically positioned companies. The Company expects to target companies in multiple industry
groups. The Company has yet to acquire, or enter into an agreement to acquire, any company or entity. 

During the period prior
to the Net Asset Sale, the Company s businesses included 1) the design, manufacture, and marketing of environmentally ruggedized
computers and computer displays known as industrial workstations; 2) the design, development and marketing of software for worldwide
use in factory automation and control and in test and measurement environments; and 3) providing application engineering support
to customers of its own and third parties  products. These businesses were sold on March 31, 2004 to the Purchaser. 

Liquidity and Management Plans  

The Company became
a  public shell  corporation on April 1, 2004 following the Net Asset Sale and since that date its operational activities
have been limited to considering sundry and various acquisition opportunities, and its financial activities have been limited to
administrative activities and incurring expenditures for accounting, legal, filing, printing, office and auditing services. These
expenditures have been paid with the $30,000 cash retained from the businesses that were sold, from $50,000 of proceeds from the
sale of common stock on April 1, 2004 to Dorman Industries and from $230,411 of proceeds from the sale of stock since that date
to certain accredited investors, including Dorman Industries. 

As reflected in the
accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 2016, cash totals $312. Based on such balance and management s forecast of activity
levels during the period that it may remain a  public shell  corporation, management believes that it will have to
again sell through private placement a number of additional shares of common stock to generate sufficient cash to pay its current
liabilities and its administrative expenses as such expenses become due in 2016. If the Company has not identified and consummated
an acquisition by that date, the Company will need to obtain additional funds to maintain its administrative activities as a public
shell company. Management intends to obtain such administrative funds from Dorman Industries in the form of loans or through equity
sales in an amount sufficient to sustain operations at their current level. Dorman Industries owns 63.36% of the Company s
outstanding common stock. There can be no assurance that Dorman Industries or any other party will advance needed funds on any
terms. The Company has not identified as yet potential acquisition candidates, the acquisition of which would mean that the Company
would cease being a  public shell  and begin operating activities. 

In the opinion of management,
all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have
been included. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company s latest annual report on Form 10-K. 

The results of the
operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the full year. Additionally, since the Net Asset Sale, which was effective April 1, 2004, the Company has had
no revenue generating activities. 

Note 2   Earnings
Per Share  

The weighted average
shares outstanding used in computing basic loss per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
have been adjusted to give effect to the five-for-one reverse stock split discussed in Note 1. The Company has no dilutive securities. 

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations  

Readers should refer
to a description of the Net Asset Sale described in Note 1 to the condensed financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. As
described therein, the net assets and industrial controls businesses of the Company were sold effective as of the close of business
on March 31, 2004. Since April 1, 2004, the Company has not engaged in any revenue generating activities, although it has considered
various investment opportunities and it has incurred administrative expenses related to legal, accounting and administrative activities.
The Company has had no employees since that date. The administrative activities of the Company are performed by the Chairman, who
also serves as the CEO, President and Principal Financial Officer. 

Three Month Periods Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015   

Direct administrative
expenses of the Company totaled $3,378 and $3,541 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively,
as the administrative services provided in the 2016 period were were consistent with those provided in the 2015 period. 

Nine Month Periods Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015   

Direct administrative
expenses of the Company totaled $18,071and $14,208 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
as the administrative services provided in the first quarter of the 2016 period were more than those provided in the comparable
2015 period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Primary sources of
liquidity for the Company following the March 31, 2004 Net Asset Sale have been cash balances that have been used to pay administrative
expenses. Operating expenses of the Company have been funded with a) $30,000 cash retained from the businesses that were sold,
b) $50,000 of proceeds from the sale of common stock on April 1, 2004 to Dorman Industries, and c) $230,411 of proceeds from the
sale of stock since that date to certain accredited investors, including Dorman Industries. 

As reflected in the
accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 2016, cash totals $312. Based on such balance and management s forecast of activity
levels during the period that it may remain a  public shell  corporation, management believes that it will have to again
sell through private placement a number of additional shares of common stock to generate sufficient cash to pay its current liabilities
and its administrative expenses as such expenses become due in 2016. If the Company has not identified and consummated an acquisition
by that date, the Company will need to obtain additional funds to maintain its administrative activities as a public shell company.
Management intends to obtain such administrative funds from Dorman Industries in the form of loans or through equity sales in an
amount sufficient to sustain operations at their current level. Dorman Industries owns 63.36% of the Company s outstanding
common stock. There can be no assurance that Dorman Industries or any other party will advance needed funds on any terms. The Company
has not identified as yet potential acquisition candidates, the acquisition of which would mean that the Company would cease being
a  public shell  and begin operating activities. 

While it is the Company's
objective to ultimately be able to use the securities of the Company as a currency in the acquisition of portfolio businesses,
the initial acquisitions of portfolio businesses may require the Company to be infused with additional capital thereby diluting
the Company's shareholders, including Dorman Industries to the extent that it does not participate in the capital infusion. 

Uncertainties Relating to Forward
Looking Statements   

Item 2 - Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation  and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain certain  forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. While management of the Company believes any forward-looking statements
it has made are reasonable, actual results could differ materially since the statements are based on current management expectations
and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following : 

We have had no operating history since
April 2004 and no revenues or earnings from operations since April 2004. We have no material assets and we will sustain operating
expenses without corresponding revenues at least until the consummation of a business combination.    

Since we have no operating history, we
will be subject to the risks inherent in establishing a new business. We have not identified what our new line of business will
be; therefore, we cannot fully describe the specific risks presented by such business.    

We may be unable to successfully identify
and acquire a suitable merger partner or acquisition candidate.    

We will incur significant costs in connection
with our evaluation of suitable merger partners and acquisition candidates. As part of our plan to acquire or invest in strategically
positioned companies, our management is seeking, analyzing, and evaluating potential acquisition and merger candidates. We have
incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, such as due diligence and legal and other professional fees and expenses,
as part of these efforts. Notwithstanding these efforts and expenditures, we cannot give any assurance that we will identify an
appropriate acquisition opportunity in the near term, or at all.    

Because we may consummate a merger or
acquisition with a company in any industry and are not limited to any particular type of business, there is no current basis for
shareholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target
business which we may ultimately acquire.    

The reporting requirements under federal
securities law may delay or prevent us from making certain acquisitions. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, require companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including certified
financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition.
The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare such statements may significantly delay or
essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by us.    

The role of our management team and key
personnel from the target business we acquire cannot presently be ascertained. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals
we engage after a redeployment of our assets, we cannot assure that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.    

We must conduct a due diligence investigation
of the target businesses we intend to acquire. Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting,
finance, and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence
on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure that this diligence will reveal all material issues that may affect
a particular target business, or that factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control will not later
arise.    

Net Operating Losses ( NOLs )
may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and eliminate income taxes otherwise payable
on such taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Based on current federal corporate income tax rates, our NOL carryforwards
could provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits
in future years will depend upon the amount of our otherwise taxable income. If we do not have sufficient taxable income in future
years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOL carryforwards permanently. Consequently,
our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our substantial NOL will depend significantly on our success in identifying
suitable merger partners and/or acquisition candidates, and once identified, successfully consummate a merger with and/or acquisition
of these candidates. Additionally, if we underwent an ownership change, the NOL carryforward limitations would impose an annual
limit on the amount of the taxable income that may be offset by our NOL generated prior to the ownership change. If an ownership
change were to occur, we may be unable to use a significant portion of our NOL to offset taxable income. In general, an ownership
change occurs when, as of any testing date, the aggregate of the increase in percentage points of the total amount of a corporation s
stock owned by  5-percent stockholders  within the meaning of the NOL carryforward limitations whose percentage ownership
of the stock has increased as of such date over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by each such  5-percent stockholder 
at any time during the three-year period preceding such date is more than 50 percentage points. In general, persons who own 5%
or more of a corporation s stock are  5-percent stockholders,  and all other persons who own less than 5% of
a corporation s stock are treated together as a public group. The amount of NOL carryforwards that we have claimed has not
been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ). The IRS could challenge our calculation
of the amount of our NOL or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred and other provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOL to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful
with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOL carryforwards to us could be substantially reduced.     

We may effect an acquisition or merger
with a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated
with companies operating in the target business  home jurisdiction, including any of the following a) rules and regulations
or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals; b) tariffs and trade barriers; c) regulations related to
customs and import/export matters; e) longer payment cycles; f) tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws
as compared to the United States; g) currency fluctuations and exchange controls; h) challenges in collecting accounts receivable;
i) cultural and language differences; j) employment regulations; j) crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks
and wars; and l) deterioration of political relations with the United States. We cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately
address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer.    

If we effect an acquisition or merger
with a company located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such company operates will govern almost
all of the material agreements relating to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce
any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement
of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability
to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities
or capital.    

Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.    

In the event we engage in a business combination
that results in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant
registration and compliance costs.    

Management anticipates that it may be
able to participate in only one potential business venture because a business partner might require exclusivity. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk to our shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture
against gains from another.    

Our common stock is quoted only on the
OTC bulletin board and there may not be a sustained trading market for our common stock.    

Our common stock may be subject to significant
restriction on resale due to federal penny stock restrictions.    

The market prices of our common stock
have been highly volatile. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated
to the operating performance of particular companies.    

Although our stockholders may receive
dividends if, as, and when declared by our Board of Directors, we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future.    

Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
provides that our Board of Directors will be authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to
30,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any qualifications,
limitations, or restrictions of the shares of each series, including the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting
rights, terms of redemption, including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences, and the number
of shares constituting any series or designations of any series. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our
common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay,
defer, or prevent a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders.    

A key element of our growth strategy is
to make acquisitions. As part of our acquisition strategy, we may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for
such acquisitions. These issuances could be significant. To the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common
stock as consideration, current stockholders  equity interest in the Company will be diluted.    

If the Company enters a business combination
with a private concern, that, in all likelihood, would result in the Company issuing securities to shareholders of any such private
company. The issuance of our previously authorized and unissued Common Stock would result in reduction in percentage of shares
owned by our present and prospective shareholders and may result in a change in our control or in our management.    

Our principal shareholder, Daniel J. Dorman,
owns or controls 63.36% of our common stock. His wife owns 3.96% of our common stock. Consequently, they will have significant
influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, but not requiring the approval of the minority shareholders.
In addition, he is now an officer and director. Because he and his wife own or control a majority of our common stock, they will
be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors, allowing them to exercise significant control of our affairs and
management. In addition, they may transact most corporate matters requiring shareholder approval by written consent, without a
duly-noticed and duly-held meeting of shareholders.

Item 3.    Quantitative

Item 4.    Controls
                                         and Procedures  

(a)    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  

As of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company performed an evaluation under the supervision of,
and with the participation of, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the design and
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in the timely and accurate recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of material financial and non-financial information
within the time periods specified within the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. 

(b)    Changes in internal controls.  

There have
been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
