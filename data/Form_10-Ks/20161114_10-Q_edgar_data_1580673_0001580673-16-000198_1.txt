1.  
    ORGANIZATION 
     KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on February 6, 2013 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and intends to continue to operate in such a manner.  The Company s business is conducted through KBS Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership II (the  Operating Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 7, 2013.  The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a   0.1%   partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership.  KBS Strategic Opportunity Holdings II LLC ( REIT Holdings ), a Delaware limited liability company formed on February 7, 2013, owns the remaining   99.9%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and is the sole limited partner.  The Company is the sole member and manager of REIT Holdings. The Company has   three   wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ),   two   of which lease the Company s hotel properties and in turn contract with independent hotel management companies that manage the day-to-day operations of the Company s hotels; the third consolidates the Company s wholly owned TRSs.  The Company s TRSs are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates. 
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the business of the Company has been externally managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of the Company, since July 2013 pursuant to an advisory agreement (the  Advisory Agreement ).  The Advisor conducts the Company s operations and manages its portfolio of real estate loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related investments.  The Advisor has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with STAM, a real estate operating company to provide real estate acquisition and portfolio management services to the Advisor in connection with any investments the Company may make in value-added real estate, distressed debt, and real estate-related investments in Europe.  On July 3, 2013, the Company issued   21,739   shares of its common stock to the Advisor at a purchase price of   $9.20   per share.  
  The Company expects to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of opportunistic real estate, real estate-related loans, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments located in the United States and Europe.  Such investments may include the acquisition of distressed debt, the origination and acquisition of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate-related loans, investment in opportunistic real estate and investments in real estate-related debt securities such as residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.  The Company may also invest in entities that make similar investments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   two   hotel properties,   two   office properties,   one   first mortgage loan and an investment in an unconsolidated entity. 
  From July 3, 2013 to August 11, 2014, the Company conducted a private placement offering (the  Private Offering ) exempt from registration under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act ).  The Company sold   3,619,851   shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of   $32.2 million   in the Private Offering.  
  On November 14, 2013, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) to offer a maximum of   180,000,000   shares of common stock for sale to the public (the  Public Offering ), of which   100,000,000   shares were registered in a primary offering and   80,000,000   shares were registered to be sold under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan.  The SEC declared the Company s registration statement effective on August 12, 2014. On February 11, 2016, the Company filed an amended registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a second class of common stock designated as Class T shares and to designate its initially offered and outstanding common stock as Class A shares. Pursuant to the amended registration statement, the Company is offering to sell any combination of Class A and Class T shares in the Public Offering but in no event may the Company sell more than   180,000,000   of shares of its common stock pursuant to the Public Offering.  The Company commenced offering Class T shares of our common stock for sale to the public on February 17, 2016.  KBS Capital Markets Group LLC (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, serves as the dealer manager of the Public Offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement originally dated August 12, 2014 and amended and restated February 17, 2016 (the  Dealer Manager Agreement ).  Previously the Dealer Manager served as dealer manager for the Private Offering. The Dealer Manager is responsible for marketing the Company s shares.

On January 7, 2015, the Company broke escrow in the Public Offering and through September 30, 2016, the Company had sold   8,288,466   and   3,931,258   shares of Class A and Class T common stock in the Public Offering, respectively, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $119.4 million  , including   129,281   and   3,058   shares of Class A and Class T common stock sold under its dividend reinvestment plan, respectively, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $1.3 million  . Also as of September 30, 2016, the Company had redeemed   4,374   shares of Class A common stock for   $40,000  .  
  On each of April 2, 2014 and July 31, 2014, the Company issued   120,106   shares of Class A common stock to Willowbrook Capital Group LLC, an entity owned and controlled by Keith D. Hall, one of the Company s directors and the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and Peter McMillan III, also one of the Company s directors and the Company s President, for   $1.0 million  . The Company issued these shares of common stock in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act.   
   
           2.  
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for the addition of an accounting policy related to foreign currency translation. For further information about the Company s accounting policies, refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods.  Operating results for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.   
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, REIT Holdings, the Operating Partnership and their direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling interest.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.   
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.    
  Selling Commissions, Dealer Manager Fees and Stockholder Servicing Fee 
  Prior to February 17, 2016, the Company paid the Dealer Manager up to   6.5%   of the price per share of Class A common stock sold in the Private Offering and the Public Offering as a selling commission.  The Dealer Manager reallowed   100%   of commissions earned to participating broker-dealers.  No sales commissions were paid on shares sold through the dividend reinvestment plan.  The Company paid the Dealer Manager up to   3.0%   of the price per share of Class A common stock sold in the Private Offering and the Public Offering as a dealer manager fee.  No dealer manager fee was payable on shares sold under the dividend reinvestment plan.  From its dealer manager fee, the Dealer Manager reallowed to any participating broker-dealer up to   1.0%   of the price per share of Class A common stock sold in the Private Offering and the Public Offering attributable to that participating broker-dealer as a marketing fee and in special cases the dealer manager could increase the reallowance.  A reduced dealer manager fee was payable with respect to certain volume discount sales.

On February 17, 2016, the Company and the Dealer Manager entered into an Amended and Restated Dealer Manager Agreement (the  Amended Dealer Manager Agreement ) to provide the terms pursuant to which the Dealer Manager will offer and sell the Company s Class A and Class T shares of common stock in the Public Offering.  Under the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, the Company pays selling commissions to the Dealer Manager in amounts up to   6.5%   of the price per share of Class A common stock sold and up to   3.0%   of the price per share of Class T common stock sold.  Additionally, the Company pays dealer manager fees to the Dealer Manager in an amount up to   2.0%   of the price per share of Class A and Class T common stock sold.  The Dealer Manager reallows all selling commissions to participating broker dealers and may generally reallow (from its dealer manager fee) to any participating broker dealer up to   1.0%   of the gross proceeds from the primary portion of the Public Offering attributable to that participating broker dealer as a marketing fee; in select cases up to   1.5%   of the gross proceeds from the primary portion of the Public Offering may be reallowed.  No selling commissions or dealer manager fees are payable on shares of common stock sold under the dividend reinvestment plan. 
  Also, under the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager receives an annual stockholder servicing fee of   1.0%   of the purchase price per share (ignoring any discounts that may be available to certain categories of purchasers) of Class T common stock sold in the primary portion of the Public Offering solely to the extent there is a broker dealer of record with respect to such Class T share that has entered a currently effective selected dealer agreement or servicing agreement that provides for the payment to such broker dealer of the stockholder servicing fee with respect to such Class T share, and such broker dealer of record is in compliance with the applicable terms of such selected dealer agreement or servicing agreement related to such payment.  To the extent payable, the stockholder servicing fee accrues daily and is paid monthly in arrears, and the Dealer Manager reallows   100%   of the stockholder servicing fee to such broker dealer of record for services provided to Class T stockholders after the initial sale of the Class T share.  In addition, no stockholder servicing fee is paid with respect to Class T shares purchased through the dividend reinvestment plan or issued pursuant to a stock dividend.  
  The Company records the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and the related liability in an amount equal to the maximum stockholder servicing fee payable in relation to the Class T share on the date the share is issued.  For each share of Class T common stock in the Primary Offering, the maximum stockholder servicing fee equals   4%   of the purchase price per share (ignoring any discounts in purchase price that may be available to certain categories of purchasers).  The liability will be reduced over time, as the fees are paid to the Dealer Manager, or it will be adjusted if the fees are no longer payable as a result of the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the date at which aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals   10%   of the gross proceeds from the Primary Offering in which the Class T share was sold, as calculated by the Company with the assistance of the Dealer Manager after the termination of the Primary Offering in which the Class T share was sold, (ii) a listing of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange, (iii) a merger or other extraordinary transaction, and (iv) the date the Class T share associated with the stockholder servicing fee is no longer outstanding such as upon its redemption or the Company s dissolution. 
  Foreign Currency Translation  
  The Company has a participating loan facility funded in Euros which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and recorded as an investment in unconsolidated entity in the accompanying balance sheet.  The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, however the functional currency of the unconsolidated entity is the Euro.  At the end of each reporting period, before determining the Company s share of its equity investment, the results of operations of the unconsolidated entity is translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency rates of exchange in effect during the period, and the assets and the liabilities of the unconsolidated entity are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of stockholders  equity.

Segments 
  The Company has invested in opportunistic real estate investments and originated a loan secured by a non-stabilized real estate asset. In general, the Company intends to hold its investments in opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows. As a result, the Company s management views opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets as similar investments. Substantially all of its revenue and net income (loss) is from opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets, and therefore, the Company currently aggregates its operating segments into   one   reportable business segment. 
  Per Share Data 
  Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding for each class of share outstanding during such period.  Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock equals basic net income (loss) per share of common stock as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the purpose of determining the weighted average number of shares outstanding, stock dividends issued are adjusted retroactively and treated as if they were issued and outstanding for all periods presented.   
  The Company s board of directors has declared and issued the following stock dividends on shares of the Company s common stock through the filing date of this report: 

For the purpose of calculating the dollar amount of the Class A and Class T stock dividends issued, the Company used the current Class A and Class T primary offering price in the Public Offering.

Cash distributions declared per share of Class A common stock were   $0.098   and   $0.154   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Cash distributions declared per share of Class T common stock were   $0.074   and   $0.098   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Cash distributions for Class T Shares are reduced by the applicable daily stockholder servicing fees. Distributions declared per share of Class A common stock assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Distributions declared per share of Class T common stock assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and from March 2, 2016 through September 30, 2016, respectively. Each day during the period from March 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 was a record date for distributions. Distributions for this period were calculated based on stockholders of record each day during this period at a rate of (i)   $0.00026202   per share per day less (ii) the applicable daily stockholder servicing fees accrued for and allocable to any class of common stock, divided by the  number of shares of common stock of such class outstanding as of the close of business on each respective record date. Each day during the period from April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 was a record date for distributions. Distributions for this period were calculated based on stockholders of record each day during this period at a rate of (i)   $0.00052404   per share per day less (ii) the applicable daily stockholder servicing fees accrued for and allocable to any class of common stock, divided by the  number of shares of common stock of such class outstanding as of the close of business on each respective record date. On September 27, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared a one-time cash distribution in the amount of   $0.05   per share on the outstanding shares of all classes of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 27, 2016. The Company did not declare cash distributions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.    
  In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260-10-45,   Earnings Per Share  , the Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated based on dividends declared ( distributed earnings ) and the rights of common shares and participating securities in any undistributed earnings, which represents net income remaining after deduction of dividends declared during the period.  The undistributed earnings are allocated to all outstanding common shares based on the relative percentage of each class of shares to the total number of outstanding shares.  The Company does not have any participating securities outstanding other than Class A Common Stock and Class T Common stock during the periods presented.

  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Update 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU No. 2014-09 ).  ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)   and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  ASU No. 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of   Leases (Topic 840).    ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU No. 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date. The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 on its financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU No. 2015-02 ), which amended the existing accounting standards for consolidation under both the variable interest model and the voting model. ASU No. 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU No. 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 using: (a) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (b) by applying the amendments retrospectively. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 and re-evaluated its consolidation analysis of its joint ventures, concluding that such adoption did not result in (a) the classification of any entities as VIEs, (b) a consolidation of entities not previously consolidated (c) a deconsolidation of entities previously consolidated. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU No. 2016-01 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU No. 2016-01 primarily affects accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected.  ASU No. 2016-01 also requires entities to present financial assets and financial liabilities separately, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset in the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU No. 2016-02 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 changes the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted.  The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU No. 2016-13 ).  ASU No. 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  ASU No. 2016-13 also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale securities.  An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as is currently required.   ASU No. 2016-13 also requires new disclosures.  For financial assets measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to disclose information about how it developed its allowance for credit losses, including changes in the factors that influenced management s estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes.  For financing receivables and net investments in leases measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to further disaggregate the information it currently discloses about the credit quality of these assets by year of the asset s origination for as many as five annual periods. For available for sale securities, an entity will be required to provide a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses and an aging analysis for securities that are past due.  ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU No. 2016-15 ).  ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, including the following that are or may be relevant to the Company: (a) Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; (b) Cash payments relating to contingent consideration made soon after an acquisition s consummation date (i.e., approximately three months or less) should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities. Payments made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the original contingent consideration liability. Payments made in excess of the amount of the original contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities; (c) Cash payments received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss (or each component loss, if an entity receives a lump-sum settlement);  (d) Relating to distributions received from equity method investments, ASU No. 2016-15 provides an accounting policy election for classifying distributions received from equity method investments. Such amounts can be classified using a (1) cumulative earnings approach, or (2) nature of distribution approach. Under the cumulative earnings approach, an investor would compare the distributions received to its cumulative equity method earnings since inception.  Any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings would be considered a return on investment and classified in operating activities. Any excess distributions would be considered a return of investment and classified in investing activities. Alternatively, an investor can choose to classify the distributions based on the nature of activities of the investee that generated the distribution. If the necessary information is subsequently not available for an investee to determine the nature of the activities, the entity should use the cumulative earnings approach for that investee and report a change in accounting principle on a retrospective basis;  (e) In the absence of specific guidance, an entity should classify each separately identifiable cash source and use on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. For cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated, the classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

Operating Leases 
  The Company s office properties are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the leases had remaining terms, excluding options to extend, of up to   8.6   years with a weighted-average remaining term of   2.4   years.  Some of the leases may have provisions to extend the term of the lease, options for early termination for all or a part of the leased premises after paying a specified penalty, rights of first refusal to purchase the property at competitive market rates, and other terms and conditions as negotiated.  The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants.  Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires a security deposit from the tenant in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit.  The amount required as a security deposit varies depending upon the terms of the respective lease and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally is not a significant amount.  Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit.  Security deposits received in cash related to office tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $0.7 million   and   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the future minimum rental income from the Company s office properties under its non-cancelable operating leases was as follows (in thousands):

The Company s notes payable contain financial and non-financial debt covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. 
  The Company s note payable with respect to the Springmaid Beach Resort Mortgage Loan requires the Company to maintain a minimum working capital reserve in an amount sufficient to fund the working capital requirements of the Springmaid Beach Resort through the off-peak season, which amount shall be reduced by any amounts for working capital reserved by the third-party hotel operator. In addition, until certain renovations are complete, the loan documents impose a  cash trap  which restricts the use of accumulated cash from the Springmaid Beach Resort to the payment of working capital shortfalls, renovation expenditures and distributions required to satisfy the Company s REIT requirements. The working capital reserve was included in restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  Recent Financing Transaction 
  Lincoln Court Mortgage Loan 
  On May 20, 2016, in connection with the Company s acquisition of Lincoln Court, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary (the  Lincoln Court Owner ), entered into a   four  -year mortgage loan with an unaffiliated lender (the  Lender ) for borrowings of up to   $36.2 million   secured by Lincoln Court (the  Lincoln Court Mortgage Loan ).  At closing,   $33.5 million   of the loan was funded and the remaining   $2.7 million   was available for future disbursements to be used for tenant improvement and leasing commission costs, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents. 
  The Lincoln Court Mortgage Loan matures on June 1, 2020, with a   one  -year extension option, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents, including the payment of an extension fee, equal to   0.125%   of the amount committed under the loan.  The Lincoln Court Mortgage Loan bears interest at a floating rate of   175   basis points over one-month LIBOR.  The Lincoln Court Owner has the right to repay the loan in whole at any time, or in part from time to time.  Prepayments made before June 1, 2017 are subject to an exit fee equal to   0.5%   of any principal amount prepaid. 
  KBS SOR US Properties II LLC ( SOR US Properties II ), the Company s indirect wholly owned subsidiary, is providing a guaranty of an amount not greater than   25%   of the outstanding balance of the Lincoln Court Mortgage Loan with respect to certain potential fees, costs, expenses, losses or damages incurred or suffered by the lender as a result of certain intentional actions committed by the Lincoln Court Owner in violation of the loan documents.  SOR US Properties II is also providing a guaranty of the principal balance and any interest or other sums outstanding under the Lincoln Court Mortgage Loan in the event of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the Lincoln Court Owner, certain direct or indirect transfers or financings of Lincoln Court in violation of the loan documents and the violation of certain other terms of the loan documents by the Lincoln Court Owner. 
   
           7.  
    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
     The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates.  The primary goal of the Company s risk management practices related to interest rate risk is to prevent changes in interest rates from adversely impacting the Company s ability to achieve its investment return objectives.  The Company does not enter into the derivatives for speculative purposes.  
  The Company enters into interest rate caps to mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on its variable rate notes payable. The values of interest rate caps are primarily impacted by interest rates, market expectations about interest rates, and the remaining life of the instrument. In general, increases in interest rates, or anticipated increases in interest rates, will increase the value of interest rate caps. As the remaining life of an interest rate cap decreases, the value of the instrument will generally decrease towards zero.

During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an unrealized loss of   $1,000   and   $43,000   on its derivative instruments, respectively, which was included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of   $14,000   and   $68,000   on its derivative instrument, respectively, which was included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.    
   
           8.  
    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
     Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  In addition, the Company is required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets).  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach.  Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;   
                
    Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.   
     The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment.  The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company s financial instruments.  Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades.  The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly.  The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value: 
  Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rent and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities  :  These balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items.

Real estate loan receivable:   The Company s real estate loan receivable is presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost net of recorded loan loss reserves (if any) and not at fair value.  The fair value of real estate loan receivable was estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected cash flows for the loan, underlying collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans) and estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs. 
  Derivative instruments:     The Company s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The valuation of these instruments are determined using a proprietary model that utilizes observable inputs.  As such, the Company classifies these inputs as Level 2 inputs.  The proprietary model uses the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and volatility.  The fair value of interest rate caps (floors) are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash payments (receipts) which would occur if variable interest rates rise above (below) the strike rate of the caps (floors). The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected payments (receipts) on the cap (floor) are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves and volatilities. 
  Notes payable:   The fair value of the Company s notes payable are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs.  
  The following were the face value, carrying amount and fair value of the Company s financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, which carrying amounts do not approximate the fair values (in thousands): 

Disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company as of the period end and requires a significant amount of judgment. Despite increased capital market and credit market activity, transaction volume for certain financial instruments remains relatively low. This has made the estimation of fair values difficult and, therefore, both the actual results and the Company s estimate of value at a future date could be materially different. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company measured the following assets at fair value (in thousands):

    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
     The Company has entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor and dealer manager agreements with the Dealer Manager with respect to the Private Offering and the Public Offering.  These agreements entitle the Advisor and the Dealer Manager to specified fees upon the provision of certain offering-related services and the investment of funds in real estate-related investments, among other services, as well as reimbursement of organization and offering costs incurred by the Advisor and the Dealer Manager on behalf of the Company and certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company. In addition, the Advisor is entitled to certain other fees, including an incentive fee upon achieving certain performance goals, as described in the Advisory Agreement. The Advisor also serves as the advisor for KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. ( KBS REIT I ), KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. ( KBS REIT II ), KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. ( KBS REIT III ), KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc. ( KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT ), KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. ( KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT ) and KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc. ( KBS Growth   Income REIT ). The Dealer Manager also serves as the dealer manager for the public offering of KBS Growth   Income REIT and for the dividend reinvestment plan offerings for KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT and KBS REIT III.  
  Under the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager receives an annual stockholder servicing fee of   1.0%   of the purchase price per share (ignoring any discounts that may be available to certain categories of purchasers) of Class T common stock sold in the primary portion of the Public Offering.  Such fee is payable solely to the extent there is a third party broker dealer of record with respect to such Class T share that has entered into a currently effective selected dealer agreement or servicing agreement that provides for the payment to such broker dealer of the stockholder servicing fee with respect to such Class T share, and such broker dealer of record is in compliance with the applicable terms of such selected dealer agreement or servicing agreement related to such payment.  To the extent payable, the stockholder servicing fee will accrue daily and be paid monthly in arrears, and the Dealer Manager will reallow 100% of the stockholder servicing fee to such broker dealer of record for services provided to Class T stockholders after the initial sale of the Class T share.  In addition, no stockholder servicing fee will be paid with respect to Class T shares purchased through the dividend reinvestment plan or issued pursuant to a stock dividend.  
  On January 6, 2014, the Company, together with KBS REIT I, KBS REIT II, KBS REIT III, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, the Dealer Manager, the Advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities, entered into an errors and omissions and directors and officers liability insurance program where the lower tiers of coverage are shared. The cost of these lower tiers is allocated by the Advisor and its insurance broker among each of the various entities covered by the plan, and is billed directly to each entity. The allocation of these shared coverage costs is proportionate to the pricing by the insurance marketplace for the first tiers of directors and officers liability coverage purchased individually by each REIT. The Advisor s and the Dealer Manager s portion of the shared lower tiers  cost is proportionate to the respective entities  prior cost for the errors and omissions insurance. In June 2015, KBS Growth   Income REIT was added to the insurance program  at terms similar to those described above. The insurance program was renewed and is effective through June 30, 2017. 
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, no other business transactions occurred between the Company and these other KBS-sponsored programs. 
  The Advisory Agreement has a   one  -year term that expires August 12, 2017.  The Company may terminate the Advisory Agreement on   60   days  written notice.  The Advisor in its sole discretion may defer any fee payable to it under the Advisory Agreement.  All or any portion of such fee not taken may be deferred without interest and paid when the Advisor determines.

In some circumstances, if the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture fails to complete the acquisition it may forfeit up to   $3.0 million  . 
  210 West 31   st    Street is located in New York, New York and consists of an   8,637   square foot development site located directly across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. 210 West 31   st    Street is currently a   23,110   square foot,   2  -story building with basement. The Company intends to make significant renovations or improvements to 210 West 31   st    Street, including demolishing the existing structure and redeveloping the property into a   2  -story retail building with a lower level and a rooftop deck and currently estimates these renovation and improvements to cost approximately   $14.2 million  .

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and the notes thereto.  As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, KBS Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the  Operating Partnership,  and to their subsidiaries.   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   seeks,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   plans,   intends,   should  or similar expressions.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law.   
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:   
             
    We have a limited operating history and as of   September 30, 2016  , our total assets were   $253.0 million  .  You will not have an opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them, making our future operations speculative.  
                
    We depend on our advisor to identify suitable investments and conduct our operations and our dealer manager to conduct our offering.   
                
    All of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager and other KBS-affiliated entities.  As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other KBS-advised programs and investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors.  These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions.  
                
    There is no assurance that we will raise the maximum offering amount in our initial public offering.  If we raise substantially less than the maximum offering amount, we may not be able to invest in a diverse portfolio of real estate-related assets and the value of an investment in us may vary more widely with the performance of specific assets.  There is a greater risk that stockholders will lose money in their investment in us if we have less diversity in our portfolio and our general and administrative expenses may constitute a greater percentage of our revenue.  
                
    Our advisor and its affiliates receive fees in connection with transactions involving the origination, acquisition and management of our investments. These fees will be based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us. This may influence our advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us and increase our stockholders  risk of loss. 
                
    Our distribution policy is generally not to use offering proceeds to make distributions. However, we may pay distributions from any source, including, without limitation, from offering proceeds or borrowings (which may constitute a return of capital). If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for investment in properties and other assets, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
                
    If we are unable to find suitable investments, we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions. 
                
    Our policies do not limit us from incurring debt until our total liabilities would exceed 75% of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves), and we may exceed this limit with the approval of the conflicts committee of our board of directors. During the early stages of our initial public offering, and to the extent financing in excess of this limit is available on attractive terms, our conflicts committee may approve debt such that our total liabilities would exceed this limit. High debt levels could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of an investment in us. 
                
    Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and generate returns to stockholders.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Except with respect to unimproved or non-incoming producing property, we are not limited in the percentage of net proceeds that we may allocate to a specific real estate asset type. Thus, we may make all of our investments in investments which present an increased risk of loss. In addition, we may change our targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments we initially expect to focus on. 
                
    We expect to focus our investments in real estate-related loans and real estate-related debt securities in distressed debt, which involves more risk than in performing debt. 
                
    Our opportunistic property-acquisition strategy involves a higher risk of loss than would a strategy of investing in stabilized properties. 
                
    We have made foreign investments and will be susceptible to risks associated with such investments, including changes in currency exchange rates, adverse political or economic developments, lack of uniform accounting standards and changes in foreign laws. 
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified herein in Part II, Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 
  Overview 
  We were formed on February 6, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2014. On July 3, 2013, we commenced a private placement offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended  (the  Securities Act ), to offer a maximum of $105,000,000 of shares of common stock for sale to certain accredited investors, of which $5,000,000 of shares were offered pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan.  We ceased offering shares in our private offering on August 11, 2014.  KBS Capital Markets Group LLC, an affiliate of our advisor, served as the dealer manager of the offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement and was responsible for marketing our shares in the offering.   
  On November 14, 2013, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) to register for sale to the public a maximum of 180,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 80,000,000 shares were to be offered pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan.  The SEC declared our registration statement effective on August 12, 2014 and we retained KBS Capital Markets Group LLC to serve as the dealer manager of the initial public offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement.  On February 11, 2016, we filed an amended registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a second class of common stock designated as Class T shares and to designate our initially offered and outstanding common stock as Class A shares.  Pursuant to the amended registration statement, we are offering to sell any combination of Class A and Class T shares in our primary offering and dividend reinvestment plan offering but in no event may we sell more than 180,000,000 of shares of our common stock pursuant to the offering.   We commenced offering our Class T shares of our common stock for sale to the public on February 17, 2016.  The dealer manager is responsible for marketing our shares in the initial public offering.   
  We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our offerings to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments located in the United States and Europe.  Such investments will include the acquisition of distressed debt, the origination and acquisition of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate-related loans, investment in opportunistic real estate and investments in real estate-related debt securities such as residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.  We may also invest in entities that make similar investments. Although this is our current target portfolio, we may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forego what we believe to be a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned two hotel properties, two office properties, an investment in an unconsolidated entity and had originated a first mortgage loan.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold   8,288,466   and   3,931,258   shares of Class A and Class T common stock, respectively, for  aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $119.4 million   in our initial public offering, including   129,281   and   3,058   shares of Class A and Class T of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan, respectively, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $1.3 million  . Also as of September 30, 2016, we had redeemed   4,374   shares of Class A common stock for   $40,000  .

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold   3,619,851   shares of Class A common stock for gross offering proceeds of   $32.2 million   in our private offering. Additionally, on April 2, 2014 and July 31, 2014, we issued   120,106   shares and   132,116   shares of Class A common stock for   $1.0 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, in separate private transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.   
  We have no employees and KBS Capital Advisors LLC ( KBS Capital Advisors ) has served as our external advisor since commencement of the private offering.  As our advisor, KBS Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and manages our portfolio of real estate properties and real estate-related investments. KBS Capital Advisors will make recommendations on all investments to our board of directors. All proposed investments must be approved by at least a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of the conflicts committee. Unless otherwise provided by our charter, the conflicts committee may approve a proposed investment without action by the full board of directors if the approving members of the conflicts committee constitute at least a majority of the board of directors.  KBS Capital Advisors also provides asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf.   
  We have formed a strategic relationship with STAM, a commercial real estate investment and asset management firm headquartered in Paris, France to support us and our advisor in connection with any investments we may make in Europe.  Our advisor has entered a sub-advisory agreement with STAM, pursuant to which STAM will provide real estate acquisition and portfolio management services to our advisor in connection with any investments we may make in Europe. For investments in Europe we make directly and our ownership interest is 100%, our advisor will compensate STAM for its services in sourcing and managing these investments from the fees its earns from us under the advisory agreement with us and we will pay STAM no additional compensation.  For investments we make through STAM, such as the participating loan facility we funded in June 2016, we will enter separate agreements with STAM to set forth compensation terms. We can give no assurances as to the number, if any, of investments we may make in Europe.  
   
  Market Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
  The following discussion is based on management s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets. 
  Current conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as we near the end of 2016. Current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving, although at a slow incremental rate. Growth in most advanced economies remains lackluster, with low potential growth expectations now extending into 2017.  In this economic environment the central banks of the world s major economies hold sway over perceived investment opportunities.  Quantitative easing in Japan and the Eurozone has carried over into global capital markets and has increased demand for higher risk investments. 
  The initial reaction to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union has been somewhat muted, with the exception being the continued downward pressure on the Great Britain Pound ( GBP ).  As of mid-October 2016, the GBP had weakened in excess of 20 percent, year-to-date.  The new prime minister of the U.K. remains committed to carrying out the decoupling of the U.K. from the European Union.  The details of this process remain unclear, and the uncertainty has weighed on both the U.K. and European markets.  The European Central Bank has continued to pursue a policy of quantitative easing (QE). 
  In the United States, real GDP growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2016 to a 2.9% annual rate.  This is a marked improvement over the second quarter growth rate of 1.4%.  The strong third quarter number is tempered by the fact that a large portion of gross domestic product growth was seen in increased inventories, not through consumer demand.  Consumer confidence is currently at a 3 year low.  Corporate earnings are also an area of concern, as third quarter reported earnings growth showed a clear sign of slowing.  Federal Reserve Board communications have been signaling the increased likelihood of some firming of monetary policy.  Many economists expect an increase in rates to occur in early December.  The US government bond yield curve has seen a steady increase in yields and is currently no longer sitting at near record lows. 
  Europe and Japan continue to engage in unconventional monetary policy. Asset purchases and stimulus programs in both regions have driven interest rates and investment yields to new lows. Both regions now have historically low interest rates, with some government and corporate bonds trading with negative yields. While the intent of these policies is to spur economic growth, the size of these programs is unprecedented, and the ultimate impact on those economies and the broader global financial system remains unclear.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

The U.S. commercial real estate market continues to benefit from inflows of foreign capital, albeit at a slowing rate.  With the backdrop global political conflict, and weaker international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency.  Lenders, however, have continued to cool to the market.  For balance sheet lenders, such as banks and insurance companies, underwriting standards for commercial real estate have been tightened. This has resulted in lower loan-to-value and higher debt coverage ratios. CMBS originations also have been limited as lenders are trying to adjust to the new securitization rules which require issuers to maintain an ongoing equity stake in pooled transactions. These trends have led to increased uncertainty in the level and cost of debt for commercial properties, and in turn has injected some volatility into commercial real estate markets.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On January 7, 2015, we broke escrow in our initial public offering. We are dependent upon the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering to conduct our proposed operations. We expect to obtain the capital required to purchase and originate real estate and real estate-related investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of our offering, from secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders and from any undistributed funds from our operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold   12,219,724   shares of common stock for gross offering proceeds of   $119.4 million   in our initial public offering. Additionally, we sold   3,619,851   shares of common stock in our private offering for gross offering proceeds of   $32.2 million  .  
   Regulatory developments related to the reporting of our estimated value per share under recently effective FINRA and NASD Conduct Rules, and changes to the definition of fiduciary under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) may significantly affect our ability to raise substantial additional funds in the public offering.  See Part II, Item 1A  Risk Factors  herein. If we are unable to raise substantially more funds in our initial public offering, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. Further, we will have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in the initial public offering. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions. 
  Our hotel properties generate cash flow in the form of room, food, beverage and convention services, campground and other revenues, which are reduced by hotel expenses, capital expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses.  Cash flow from operations from our hotel properties are primarily dependent upon the occupancy levels of our hotels, the average daily rates and how well we manage our expenditures. The following table provides summary information regarding our hotel properties as of   September 30, 2016  : 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    In November 2015, Springmaid Beach Resort took 238 rooms of the 452 rooms available offline to complete the renovation of a building. The 238 rooms were excluded from the percentage occupied and average revenue per available room for the period they were offline. In January 2016, the 238 rooms were put back into service and the remaining 214 rooms were taken offline to complete renovations. In May 2016, these 214 rooms were put back into service. Rooms not in service were excluded from the percentage occupied and average revenue per available room for the period they were offline. 
  Our office properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures, capital expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from office properties is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our properties, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures. As of September 30, 2016, we owned two office properties that were   88%   occupied. 
  Our real estate-related investment generates cash flow in the form of interest income, which is reduced by the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our real estate-related investment is primarily dependent on the operating performance of the underlying collateral and the borrower s ability to make its debt service payments. As of September 30, 2016, the borrower under our real estate loan receivable was current on all contractual debt service payments to us.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

As of September 30, 2016, we had mortgage debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of   $107.3 million  , with a weighted-average remaining term of 2.2 years.  As of   September 30, 2016  , $4.4 million was available under our mortgage loans for future disbursements to be used for renovation costs and tenant improvement costs, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents.  
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the dealer manager. During our organization and offering stage, these payments will include payments to the dealer manager for selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the stockholder servicing fee and payments to the dealer manager and our advisor for reimbursement of certain commercially reasonable organization and offering expenses, provided that no reimbursements made by us to our advisor or dealer manager may cause total organization and offering expenses incurred by us (including selling commissions, dealer manager fees and all other items of organization and offering expenses) to exceed 15% of the aggregate gross proceeds from our public offering as of the date of reimbursement. As of   September 30, 2016  , our advisor has incurred organization and offering expenses on our behalf related to our initial public offering of approximately   $7.7 million  . There was no limit on the organization and offering expenses we could incur in connection with our private offering.  In addition, at the termination of the primary portion of our initial public offering, our advisor and our affiliates will reimburse us to the extent that the organization and other offering expenses (which exclude selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) paid directly or reimbursed by us in connection with the primary portion of our initial public offering, regardless of when incurred, exceed 1.0% of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering. The Advisor and its affiliates will be responsible for any organization and other offering expenses related to the primary portion of our initial public offering to the extent they exceed 1.0% of gross proceeds from the primary portion of the Public Offering as of the termination of the primary portion of our initial public offering.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our advisor had incurred offering expenses on our behalf related to our private offering of   $1.0 million  , all of which have been reimbursed from proceeds from our now terminated private offering.  During our acquisition and development stage, we expect to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection and origination or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. Our currently effective advisory agreement expires August 12, 2017 but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of KBS Capital Advisors and our conflicts committee. 
  Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee. We will pay our advisor a monthly fee equal to the lesser of one-twelfth of (i) 1.0% of the cost of our investments and (ii) 2.0% of the sum of the cost of our investments, less any debt secured by or attributable to the investments. The cost of the real property investments will be calculated as the amount paid or allocated to acquire the real property, including the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property and including fees and expenses related thereto (but excluding acquisition fees paid or payable our advisor). The cost of the loans and any investments other than real property will be calculated as the lesser of (x) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment, including fees and expenses related thereto (but excluding acquisition fees paid or payable to our advisor) and (y) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, including fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment (but excluding acquisition fees paid or payable to our advisor) as of the time of calculation. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee will be determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment. 
  In addition, an affiliate of our advisor, KBS Management Group, was recently formed to provide property management services with respect to certain properties owned by KBS-advised companies.  In the future, we may engage KBS Management Group with respect to one or more of our properties to provide property management services.  With respect to any such properties, we would expect to pay KBS Management Group a monthly fee equal to a percentage of the rent (to be determined on a property by property basis, consistent with current market rates). 
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and operate as a REIT. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will be required to make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. We have not established a minimum distribution level. 
  Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expense reimbursements for the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 exceeded the charter imposed limitation; however, the conflicts committee determined that the relationship of our operating expenses to our average invested assets was justified for these periods given the costs of operating a public company and the early stage of our operations.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  We commenced operations on September 4, 2014 in connection with our first investment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned two hotel properties, two office properties, one first mortgage loan and an investment in an unconsolidated entity. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $2.6 million  , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $2.6 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We expect that our cash flows from operating activities will generally increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments and the related operations of such real estate investments. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $71.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and primarily consisted of the following: 
             
    $51.3 million for the acquisition of one office property;  
                
    $14.3 million of improvements to real estate;  
                
    $3.0 million escrow deposits for the acquisition of the Lofts at NoHo Commons; and 
                
    $2.5 million for an investment in an unconsolidated entity. 
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $110.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and primarily consisted of the following:   
             
    $65.4 million of net cash provided by offering proceeds related to our ongoing initial public offering, net of payments of commissions, dealer manager fees, stockholder servicing fees and other organization and offering costs of $4.3 million;  
                
    $45.0 million of net cash provided by debt financing as a result of proceeds from notes payable of $45.5 million, partially offset by payments of deferred financing costs of $0.5 million;  
                
    $0.5 million of noncontrolling interest contributions; and 
                
    $0.4 million of net cash distributions, after giving effect to distributions reinvested by stockholders of $0.7 million. 
     In order to execute our investment strategy, we utilize secured debt and we may, to the extent available, utilize unsecured debt, to finance a portion of our investment portfolio.  Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinancing and interest risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage.  Once we have fully invested the proceeds of our initial public offering, we expect our debt financing will be 60% or less of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves).  There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment.  Our charter limits our total liabilities such that our total liabilities may not exceed 75% of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves); however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the Conflicts Committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 47% of the cost (before depreciation or other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):    
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Amounts include principal payments only.   
   (2)    Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates and interest rates in effect at   September 30, 2016  .

  Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  As of September 30, 2015, we had originated one first mortgage loan and acquired one hotel property.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   two   hotel properties,   two   office properties,   one   first mortgage loan and an investment in an unconsolidated entity. We funded the acquisitions of these investments with proceeds from our terminated private offering, initial public offering and debt financing. Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of those in future periods as we commenced operations on September 4, 2014 in connection with our first investment and expect to make future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments. In general, we expect that our revenue and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments.

Hotel revenues increased from   $7.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $8.6 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Q C Hotel in December 2015.  We expect hotel revenues to increase in future periods as a result of the ongoing improvements in connection with the re-branding strategy of our hotel properties. Office revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   $1.9 million  . We expect office revenue to increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. 
  Interest income from our real estate loan receivable, recognized using the interest method, remained consistent at   $0.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. 
  Hotel expenses increased from   $3.7 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $5.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Q C Hotel. Office expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were   $0.5 million  . We expect total expenses to increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. 
  Asset management fees to affiliate increased from   $0.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $0.4 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the growth of our real estate portfolio. We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. All asset management fees incurred as of September 30, 2016 have been paid. 
  General and administrative expenses increased from   $0.6 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $0.7 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the growth of our real estate portfolio. We expect general and administrative costs to increase in future periods as we acquire additional investments but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue. 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased from   $0.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $2.3 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the growth of our real estate portfolio. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. 
  Interest expense increased from   $0.3 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $0.9 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to increased borrowings in connection with our acquisition activity. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the amount of proceeds raised in our ongoing initial public offering, the availability and cost of debt financing, and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives.

Hotel revenues increased from   $14.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $20.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Q C Hotel in December 2015 and increases in occupancy and average daily rate with respect to the Springmaid Beach Resort.  We expect hotel revenues to increase in future periods as a result of the ongoing improvements in connection with the re-branding strategy of our hotel properties. Office revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $3.3 million  . We expect office revenue to increase in future periods as a result of holding the assets acquired in 2016 for an entire period and anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. 
  Interest income from our real estate loan receivable, recognized using the interest method, remained consistent at   $0.3 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. 
  Hotel expenses increased from   $9.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $13.5 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Q C Hotel and an increase in occupancy with respect to the Springmaid Beach Resort. Office expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $0.9 million  . We expect total expenses to increase in future periods as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. 
  Asset management fees to affiliate increased from   $0.3 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $0.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the growth of our real estate portfolio. We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of holding the assets acquired in 2016 for an entire period and anticipated future acquisitions of real estate properties. All asset management fees incurred as of September 30, 2016 have been paid. 
  Real estate acquisition fees and expenses to affiliate and non-affiliates were $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We acquired one real estate property for $51.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we did not acquire any real estate properties. We expect real estate acquisition fees and expenses to vary in future periods based upon acquisition activity. 
  General and administrative expenses increased from   $1.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $2.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the growth of our real estate portfolio. We expect general and administrative costs to increase in future periods as we acquire additional investments but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue. 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased from   $0.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $5.3 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the growth of our real estate portfolio.

Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the amount of proceeds raised in our ongoing initial public offering, the availability and cost of debt financing, and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives. 
   
  Funds from Operations, Modified Funds from Operations and Adjusted Modified Funds from Operations 
  We believe that funds from operations ( FFO ) is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) definition.  FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs.  However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.  Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO.  Items such as acquisition fees and expenses, which had previously been capitalized prior to 2009, are currently expensed and accounted for as operating expenses.  As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations ( MFFO ) as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability.  MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses; adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above- and below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges.  We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the Investment Program Association ( IPA ) in November 2010 as interpreted by management.  Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do.   
  In addition, our management uses an adjusted MFFO ( Adjusted MFFO ) as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability.  Adjusted MFFO provides adjustments to reduce MFFO related to operating expenses that are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land.  
  We believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are helpful as measures of ongoing operating performance because they exclude costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO.  Management believes that excluding acquisition costs from MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage.  MFFO and Adjusted MFFO also exclude non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue.  Additionally, we believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provide investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance.  MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies.  MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.   
  FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP.  Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above.  Accordingly, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance.  In addition, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity.  We believe FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent amortization of above- and below-market leases and acquisition fees and expenses, are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented.  We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
             
    Adjustments for straight-line rent.    These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period;  
                
    Amortization of above- and below-market leases.    Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate; and 
                
    Acquisition fees and expenses.   Acquisition fees and expenses related to the acquisition of real estate are expensed.  Although these amounts reduce net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. Additionally, acquisition costs have been funded from the proceeds from our private and public offerings as well as from debt financings, and not from our operations. We believe this exclusion is useful to investors as it allows investors to more accurately evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance. 
     Adjusted MFFO includes adjustments to reduce MFFO related to real estate taxes, property insurance and financing costs which are capitalized with respect to certain renovation projects.  We have included adjustments for the costs incurred necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, as these costs are recurring operating costs that are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net income (loss), FFO and MFFO.     
  Our calculation of FFO, which we believe is consistent with the calculation of FFO as defined by NAREIT, is presented in the following table, along with our calculations of MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands). No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods.

   (1)      Reflects adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interest holders  share of the adjustments to convert our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO. 
   (2)      Reflects adjustments to add back our noncontrolling interest share of the adjustments to convert our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO for our equity investment in an unconsolidated entity. 
   (2)      Reflects real estate taxes, property insurance and financing costs that are capitalized with respect to certain renovation projects. During the time in which we are incurring costs necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, certain normal recurring operating costs are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net income (loss), FFO and MFFO.

FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs.  We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to improve in future periods to the extent that we continue to lease up vacant space and acquire additional assets. We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to decrease as a result of dispositions. 
   
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  Our organization and offering costs (other than selling commissions, dealer manager fees and the stockholder servicing fee) may be paid by our advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates on our behalf or may be paid directly by us.  These offering costs include all expenses incurred  in connection with our offerings.  Organization costs include all expenses incurred  in connection with our formation, including but not limited to legal fees and other costs to incorporate.  
  During our private offering, there was no limit on the amount of organization and offering costs we could incur.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had recorded $1.0 million of offering costs (other than selling commissions and dealer manager fees) related to our private offering, all of which were initially paid by our advisor or its affiliates on our behalf and subsequently reimbursed by us.        
  During our initial public offering, pursuant to the advisory agreement and dealer manager agreement, we are obligated to reimburse our advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates, as applicable, for organization and other offering costs paid by them on behalf of us, provided that no reimbursements made by us to our advisor or the dealer manager may cause total organization and offering expenses incurred by us (including selling commissions, dealer manager fees, the stockholder servicing fee to exceed 15% of the aggregate gross proceeds from our initial public offering as of the date of reimbursement. In addition, at the termination of the primary portion of our initial public offering, our advisor and our affiliates will reimburse us to the extent that the organization and other offering expenses (which exclude selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) paid directly or reimbursed by us in connection with the primary portion of our initial public offering, regardless of when incurred, exceed 1.0% of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering. The Advisor and its affiliates will be responsible for any organization and other offering expenses related to the primary portion of our initial public offering to the extent they exceed 1.0% of gross proceeds from the primary portion of the Public Offering as of the termination of the primary portion of our initial public offering.   
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor and its affiliates had incurred organization and other offering costs on our behalf in connection with the Public Offering of approximately   $7.7 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had paid   $8.3 million   in selling commissions and dealer manager fees and accrued   $1.5 million   of stockholder servicing fees. As of December 31, 2015, we had paid or accrued   $3.3 million   of other organization and offering expenses. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we reversed   $2.2 million   of accrued organization and offering expenses due to affiliates as a result of an amendment to the advisory agreement, which limits other offering costs to 1.0% of gross proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering as noted above. As of September 30, 2016, we had recorded   $1.2 million   of other organization and offering expenses, which amount represents our maximum liability for organization and offering costs as of September 30, 2016 based on the 1.0% limitation described above. 
   
  Distributions 
  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). If we meet the REIT qualification requirements, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the income that we distribute to our stockholders each year.   In general, we anticipate making distributions to our stockholders of at least 100% of our REIT taxable income so that none of our income is subject to federal income tax. Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.

Until we have fully invested the proceeds of our public offering, and from time to time during our operational stage, we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operating activities, in which case distributions may be paid in whole or in part from debt financing. Distributions declared, distributions paid and cash flow used in operations were as follows for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Distributions for the period from March 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 were based on daily record dates and were calculated at a rate of $0.00026202 per share per day less the applicable daily stockholder servicing fee. Distributions for the period from April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 were based on daily record dates and were calculated at a rate of $0.00052404 per share per day less the applicable daily stockholder servicing fee. On September 27, 2016, our board of directors declared a one-time cash distribution in the amount of $0.05 per share on the outstanding shares of all classes of our common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 27, 2016, which we paid on October 5, 2016.  
   (2)    Assumes Class A share was issued and outstanding each day that was a record date for distributions during the period presented. Assumes Class T share was issued and outstanding from March 2, 2016 through September 30, 2016. Given the distribution rate declared for the period and the applicable daily stockholder servicing fee for Class T shares of common stock, the Company did not pay cash distributions on shares of Class T common stock for record dates from March 2, 2016 to March 31, 2016. Distributions declared per Class T share for the second and third quarter of 2016 are shown assuming the stockholder servicing fee is applicable to all outstanding Class T shares. 
   (3)    Distributions are paid on a monthly basis.  Distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid on or about the first business day of the following month. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid aggregate distributions of   $1.1 million  , including   $0.4 million   distributions paid in cash and   $0.7 million   of distributions reinvested through our dividend reinvestment plan. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $2.3 million   and cash flow provided by operations was   $2.6 million  .  
  From inception through September 30, 2016, we paid cumulative distributions of $2.1 million and our cumulative net loss during the same period was $6.9 million. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operating activities, we will have less funds available for the acquisition of real estate investments, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors will experience dilution. 
  We currently expect our board of directors to authorize and declare cash distributions based on daily record dates and pay these distributions on a monthly basis. We expect that we will fund these cash distributions from interest income on our debt investments, rental and other income on our real property investments and to the extent we acquire investments with short maturities or investments that are close to maturity, we may fund distributions with the proceeds received at the maturity, payoff or settlement of those investments. We may also utilize strategic refinancings to fund cash distributions for investments that have appreciated in value after our acquisition. Generally, our distribution policy is not to pay cash distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings. However, we may fund cash distributions from any source and there are no limits to the amount of distributions that we may pay from any source, including proceeds from our public offering or the proceeds from the issuance of securities in the future, other third party borrowings, advances from our advisor or sponsors or from our advisor s deferral of its fees under the advisory agreement. Distributions paid from sources other than current or accumulated earnings and profits may constitute a return of capital. From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our taxable income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. In these situations we may make distributions in excess of our cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement. In such an event, we would look first to other third party borrowings to fund these distributions.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

During our offering stage, we currently expect our board of directors to declare stock dividends on a set quarterly basis based on quarterly record dates. Especially during the early stages of our operations and until our cash flows stabilize, our board of directors believes the declaration of stock dividends is in our best interest because it will allow us to focus on our investment strategy of investing in opportunistic real estate investments that may generate limited cash flow but have the potential for appreciation. These stock dividends may reflect in part an increase or anticipated increase in portfolio value to the extent our board of directors believes assets in our portfolio have appreciated or will appreciate in value after acquisition or after we have taken control of the assets. In addition, these stock dividends may reflect in part cash flow from operations. However, we can provide no assurances that our stock dividends will reflect appreciation in our portfolio or cash flow from operations. Unless our assets appreciate in an amount sufficient to offset the dilutive effect of any stock dividends, the return per share for later investors purchasing our stock will be below the return per share of earlier investors. With respect to any non-performing assets that we acquire, we believe that within a relatively short time after acquisition or taking control of such investments via foreclosure or deed-in-lieu proceedings, we will often experience an increase in their value. For example, in most instances, we bring financial stability to the property, which reduces uncertainty in the market and alleviates concerns regarding the property s management, ownership and future. We also may have more capital available for investment in these properties than their prior owners and operators were willing to invest, and as such, we are able to invest in tenant improvements and capital expenditures with respect to such properties, which enables us to attract substantially increased interest from brokers and tenants. 
  Our board of directors declared or issued the following stock dividends on shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC. There have been no significant changes to our policies during 2016.

Subsequent Events 
  We evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
  Status of the Offering 
  We commenced our initial public offering on August 12, 2014 and broke escrow on January 7, 2015.  As of November 4, 2016, we had sold   8,644,798   and   4,755,756   shares of Class A and Class T common stock in our initial public offering, respectively,  for aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $130.8 million  .   Included in these amounts were   195,574   and   22,876   shares of Class A and Class T common stock sold under our dividend reinvestment plan, respectively, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $1.9 million  . 
  Cash Distributions Paid 
  On October 3, 2016, we paid distributions of   $0.2 million   related to cash distributions on the outstanding shares of the common stock based on daily record dates for the period from September 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. On November 1, 2016, we paid distributions of   $0.3 million   related to cash distributions on the outstanding shares of the common stock based on daily record dates for the period from October 1, 2016 through October 31, 2016. Distributions for these periods were calculated based on stockholders of record each day during these periods at a rate of (i)   $0.00052404   per share per day less (ii) the applicable daily stockholder servicing fees accrued for and allocable to any class of common stock, divided by the number of shares of common stock of such class outstanding as of the close of business on each respective record date. 
  On October 5, 2016, we paid distributions of   $0.8 million   related to a one-time cash distribution in the amount of   $0.05   per share on the outstanding shares of all classes of our common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 27, 2016.

We issued the September 2016 stock dividend, consisting of   28,420   shares, on October 4, 2016. 
  Also, on August 11, 2016, our board of directors authorized stock dividends for the month of October 2016, in the amount of   0.001667   shares of each class of our common stock on each outstanding share of common stock issuable to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 31, 2016.

  Springmaid Beach Resort 
  In October 2016, Springmaid Beach Resort Hotel, which is located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, sustained significant damage from Hurricane Matthew. We are in the process of assessing the extent of the property damage at Springmaid Beach Resort Hotel and quantify the financial impact to our financial statements. 
  Probable Real Estate Investment 
  210 West 31   st    Street 
  On October 28, 2016, we, through a indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a joint venture (the  210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture ) with Onyx 31   st    Street LLC (the  210 West 31   st    Street JV Partner ). A wholly owned subsidiary of the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture then entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the 210 West 31   st    Street JV Partner whereby the 210 West 31   st    Street JV Partner would assign 80% of its interest in a ground lease in 210 West 31   st    Street, New York, New York ( 210 West 31   st    Street ) to the wholly owned subsidiary of the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture.  The 210 West 31   st    Street JV Partner would retain a 20% interest in the ground lease in 210 West 31   st    Street and contribute this interest in exchange for a 20% interest in the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture. The 210 West 31   st    Street JV Partner is not affiliated with us or our advisor.  The contractual purchase price of the 80% interest in the ground lease is $38.4 million plus closing costs and the remaining 20% interest has an attributable value of $9.6 million. 
  We own an 80% equity interest in the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture and is responsible for funding the purchase of the 80% interest in the ground lease. Income, losses and distributions are generally allocated based on the members  respective equity interests, subject to adjustments based on certain performance thresholds set forth in the joint venture agreement. Additionally, in certain circumstances described in the joint venture agreement, we and the 210 West 31   st    Street JV Partner may be required to make additional capital contributions to the joint venture, in proportion to the members  respective equity interests. 
  The 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture intends to fund the acquisition of 210 West 31   st    Street with capital contributions from its members and with proceeds from a mortgage loan. The 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture is currently negotiating the terms of the mortgage loan.  
  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture would be obligated to purchase the property only after satisfaction of agreed-upon closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture will complete the acquisition.  In some circumstances, if the 210 West 31   st    Street Joint Venture fails to complete the acquisition it may forfeit up to $3.0 million. 
  210 West 31   st    Street is located in New York, New York and consists of an 8,637 square foot development site located directly across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. 210 West 31   st    Street is currently a 23,110 square foot, 2-story building with basement. We intend to make significant renovations or improvements to 210 West 31   st    Street, including demolishing the existing structure and redeveloping the property into a 2-story retail building with a lower level and a rooftop deck and currently estimates these renovation and improvements to cost approximately $14.2 million.

  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund the financing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations.  We are also exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of the origination of a mortgage loan.  We are also exposed to the effects of foreign currency changes in the Euro with respect to our    2.1 million   participating loan facility.  Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes and foreign currency changes.  Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.  We may manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level.  In addition, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations.  When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned one fixed-rate real estate loan receivable. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate real estate loan receivable unless such instrument matures or is otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instrument. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value and carrying value of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable was $3.4 million. The fair value estimate of our real estate loan receivable is estimated using an internal valuation model that considers the expected cash flows for the loan, underlying collateral value and the estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. As we expect to hold our fixed rate instrument to maturity and the amounts due under such instrument would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instrument, would have a significant impact on our operations. 
  Conversely, movements in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but would not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments.  However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of floating rate instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $107.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding.  Based on interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , if interest rates were 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by $1.1 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , one-month LIBOR was 0.53111% and if the LIBOR index was reduced to 0% during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease by $0.6 million. 
  The annual effective interest rate of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable as of September 30, 2016 was 11.7%.  The effective interest rate represents the effective interest rate as of September 30, 2016, using the interest method, which we use to recognize interest income on our real estate loan receivable. The weighted-average interest rate of our variable rate debt as of September 30, 2016 was 3.1%.  The weighted-average interest rate represent the actual interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2016 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate caps, if applicable), using interest rate indices as of September 30, 2016 where applicable.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  The following risk factor supplements the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Based on sales volume to date, we expect to raise substantially less than the maximum offering amount in our ongoing public offering. Because we expect to raise substantially less than the maximum offering amount, we will not be able to invest in as diverse a portfolio of properties as we otherwise would, which will cause the value of our stockholders  investment to vary more widely with the performance of specific assets, and cause our general and administrative expenses to constitute a greater percentage of our revenue. Raising fewer proceeds in our offering, therefore, increases the risk that our stockholders will lose money in their investment.  
  Our public offering is being made on a  best efforts  basis, whereby the brokers participating in the offering have no firm commitment or obligation to purchase any of the shares. To date, the proceeds we have raised in the offering are lower than our sponsor and dealer manager originally expected. Unless we file a registration statement with the SEC to conduct a follow-on public offering, we expect our public offering to terminate in August 2017.  As a result, we do not expect to raise the maximum offering amount in the public offering. Therefore, we will make fewer investments than originally intended resulting in less diversification in terms of the number of investments owned and the geographic regions in which our investments are located. Adverse developments with respect to a single property, or a geographic region, will have a greater adverse impact on our operations than they otherwise would. In addition, our inability to raise substantial funds will increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
  Regulatory developments related to how we report our estimated value per share under recently effective FINRA and NASD Conduct Rules and changes to the definition of  fiduciary  under ERISA and the Code, may significantly affect our ability to raise substantial additional funds in the public offering. 
  In April 2016, final regulations went into effect that require FINRA members and their associated persons that participate in our public offering to disclose a per share estimated value of our shares developed in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that the per share estimated value is reliable.  As a result, we report the net investment amount of our shares as our estimated value per share, which net investment amount is based on the  amount available for investment/net investment amount  percentage shown in our estimated use of proceeds table and is effectively the purchase price of our primary offering shares, less the associated selling commission, dealer manager fee, and estimated organization and other offering expenses as shown in our estimated use of proceeds table in the prospectus for the public offering.  Also in April 2016, the DOL issued a final regulation relating to the definition of a fiduciary under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The final regulation broadens the definition of fiduciary and is accompanied by new and revised prohibited transaction exemptions relating to investments by employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA or retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including IRAs). The final regulation and the related exemptions will become applicable for investment transactions on and after April 10, 2017, but generally should not apply to purchases of our shares before that date. These regulatory developments may significantly affect our ability to raise substantial additional funds in the public offering.

  Item 1A.  Risk Factors (continued) 

We have paid distributions in part from financings and expect that in the future we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operating activities. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operating activities, we will have less funds available for investment in properties and other assets, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors will experience dilution. 
  Our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from any source, including offering proceeds or borrowings (which may constitute a return of capital), and our charter does not limit the amount of funds we may use from any source to pay such distributions. We have paid distributions in part from financings and expect that in the future we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operating activities, in which case distributions may be paid in whole or in part from debt financing. We may also fund such distributions with proceeds from the sale of assets or from the maturity, payoff or settlement of debt investments. If we fund distributions from borrowings, our interest expense and other financing costs, as well as the repayment of such borrowings, will reduce our earnings and cash flow from operating activities available for distribution in future periods. If we fund distributions from the sale of assets or the maturity, payoff or settlement of debt investments, this will affect our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities in future periods. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operating activities, we will have fewer funds available with which to make real estate investments, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors will experience dilution. In addition, to the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operating activities, a stockholder s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder s basis, the stockholder may recognize capital gain. There is no limit on the amount of distributions we may fund from sources other than from cash flow from operating activities. 
  During our public offering stage, when we may raise capital in this offering (and possibly future offerings) more quickly than we acquire income-producing assets, and from time to time during our operational stage, we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operating activities. 
  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid aggregate distributions of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, including $0.4 million of distributions paid in cash and $0.6 million of distributions reinvested in shares of our Class A common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.1 million. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.3 million. We funded our total distributions paid, which includes net cash distributions and dividends reinvested by stockholders, with $0.3 million of cash flow provided by operating activities and $0.7 million of debt financing.  
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid aggregate distributions of   $1.1 million  , including   $0.4 million   of distributions paid in cash and   $0.7 million   of distributions reinvested through our dividend reinvestment plan. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $2.3 million   and cash flow provided by operations was   $2.6 million  . We funded our total distributions paid, which includes net cash distributions and dividends reinvested by stockholders, with cash flow provided by operations. 
  From inception through September 30, 2016, we paid cumulative distributions of $2.1 million and our cumulative net loss during the same period was $6.9 million.

  Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

a) 
    During the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 
      On February 11, 2016, we filed an amended registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to add a second class of common stock designated as Class T shares and to designate our currently outstanding common stock as Class A shares. Pursuant to the registration statement, as amended, effective February 17, 2016, we are offering up to $1,000,000,000 in shares of our common stock in the primary offering, consisting of two classes of shares: Class A shares at a price of $10.00 per share and Class T shares at a price of $9.59 per share. Both classes of shares have discounts available to certain categories of purchasers. We are also offering up to 76,366,006 in shares of our common stock pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan: Class A shares at a price of $9.50 per share and Class T shares at a price of $9.12 per share. We are offering to sell any combination of Class A and Class T shares in our primary offering and dividend reinvestment plan offering but in no event may we sell more than 180,000,000 of shares of our common stock pursuant to the offering. We reserve the right to reallocate shares between the primary offering and our dividend reinvestment plan offering. Based on our current estimates, we have allocated 103,633,994 and 76,366,006 shares of our common stock to our primary and dividend reinvestment plan offerings, respectively.  
  We expect to terminate our initial public offering approximately 90 days (as determined by our Chief Executive Officer) after we have announced that we have raised $650 million in our primary initial public offering.  In no event may the primary offering  continue beyond the time period permitted by the rules promulgated by the SEC, which rules provide that absent the filing of a registration statement for a follow-on offering, this primary offering shall terminate after a three-year period. We may sell shares under the dividend reinvestment plan beyond the termination of the primary offering until we have sold all the shares under the plan.   
  As of September 30, 2016, we had sold   12,219,724   shares of common stock in our ongoing initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of   $119.4 million  , including   132,339   shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of   $1.3 million  . As of September 30, 2016, we had incurred selling commissions, dealer manager fees and organization and other offering costs in connection with our initial public offering in the amounts set forth below. We pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees to KBS Capital Markets Group, and KBS Capital Markets Group reallows all selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers. In addition, we reimburse KBS Capital Advisors and KBS Capital Markets Group for certain offering expenses as described in our prospectus, as amended and supplemented.

   (1)    Except as described in the  Plan of Distribution  section of our prospectus, as amended and supplemented, an annual stockholder servicing fee of 1.0% of the purchase price per share (ignoring any discounts that may be available to certain categories of purchasers) for the Class T shares sold in the primary portion of our initial public offering will be paid to our dealer manager and will accrue daily and be paid monthly in arrears. Our dealer manager will reallow all of the stockholder servicing fees paid to it. The stockholder servicing fee is an ongoing fee that is not paid at the time of purchase and is not intended to be a principal use of offering proceeds; it is therefore not included in the table above.  As of September 30, 2016, we had accrued approximately $1.5 million in stockholder servicing fees, which is the maximum amount of the stockholder servicing fee payable with respect to all Class T shares sold in the primary portion of our initial public offering as of September 30, 2016. 
   (2)    Organization and other offering costs (which exclude selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) are capped at 1.0% of gross offering proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering.  KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates are responsible for any organization and other offering costs related to the primary portion of our initial public offering that exceed this limit.  The amount included above represents our maximum liability for organization and other offering costs based on the 1.0% limit.  As of September 30, 2016, KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates had incurred an additional $6.5 million in organization and other offering costs on our behalf in connection with our initial public offering.

  Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (continued) 

We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of  opportunistic real estate, real estate-related loans, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments located in the United States and Europe. Such investments will include the acquisition of distressed debt, the origination and acquisition of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other real estate-related loans, investment in opportunistic real estate and investments in real estate-related debt securities such as residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. We may also invest in entities that make similar investments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had used the net proceeds from our now terminated private offering and our initial public offering and debt financing to invest $186.0 million in two hotel properties, two office properties, one first mortgage and an investment in an unconsolidated entity, including $5.4 million of acquisition fees and closing costs and origination fees and expenses. 
           c) 
    On July 3, 2013, our board of directors adopted a share redemption program that has been amended at various times thereafter and that may enable stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances.  The terms of the share redemption program described below are the terms as are currently in effect.   
     Pursuant to the share redemption program there are several limitations on our ability to redeem shares:   
             
    Unless the shares are being redeemed in connection with a stockholder's death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined under the share redemption program), we may not redeem shares until the stockholder has held the shares for one year. 
                
    During each calendar year, the share redemption program limits the number of shares we may redeem to those that we could purchase with the amount of the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under the dividend reinvestment plan during the prior calendar year.  We may, however, increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares pursuant to the program upon ten business days  notice to our stockholders. 
                
    During any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 
                
    We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency  . 
     Pursuant to the program, as amended, unless the shares are being redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability,  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined in the share redemption program), until we establish an estimated net asset value or NAV per share of our common stock, the price at which we will redeem the shares is as follows: 
             
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least one year, 92.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least two years, 95.0% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least three years, 97.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; and 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least four years, 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, stock dividends will initially be redeemed at the  net investment amount  per share, which will be based on the  amount available for investment/net investment amount  percentage shown in our estimated use of proceeds table in our prospectus, as amended and supplemented.  For each class of shares, this amount will initially equal $9.01 per share for redemptions of shares received as a result of a stock dividend.

After we establish an estimated NAV per share of our common stock, and unless the shares are being redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability, or determination of incompetence, the price at which we will redeem the shares is as follows: 
             
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least one year, 92.5% of our most recent estimated NAV per share as of the applicable redemption date; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least two years, 95.0% of our most recent estimated NAV per share as of the applicable redemption date; 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least three years, 97.5% of our most recent estimated NAV per share as of the applicable redemption date; and 
                
    For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least four years, 100% of our most recent estimated NAV per share as of the applicable redemption date. 
     For purposes of determining the time period a redeeming stockholder has held each share, the time period begins as of the date the stockholder acquired the share; provided, that shares purchased by the redeeming stockholder pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan and shares received as a stock dividend will be deemed to have been acquired on the same date as the initial share to which the dividend reinvestment plan shares or stock dividend shares relate.  The date of the share s original issuance by us is not determinative.  In addition, as described above, the shares owned by a stockholder may be redeemed at different prices depending on how long the stockholder has held each share submitted for redemption. 
  We expect to establish an estimated NAV per share no later than 150 days after the second anniversary of the date on which we broke escrow in our initial public offering. 
  The terms of our share redemption program with respect to redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence are as follows: 
             
    There is no one-year holding requirement; 
                
    Additional funds in an amount up to $500,000 are available for redemption; 
                
    Until we establish an estimated NAV per share, which we expect to be no later than June 6, 2017 (as described above), the redemption price is the amount paid to acquire the shares from us; provided that, stock dividends will initially be redeemed at the  net investment amount  per share, which will be based on the  amount available for investment/net investment amount  percentage shown in our estimated use of proceeds table in our prospectus for our initial public offering, as amended and supplemented. For each class of shares, this amount will initially equal $9.01 per share for redemptions of shares received as a result of a stock dividend; and 
                
    Once we have established an estimated NAV per share, the redemption price would be the estimated NAV of the shares, as determined by our board of directors. 
     Upon a transfer of shares any pending redemption requests with respect to such transferred shares will be canceled as of the date we accept the transfer. Stockholders wishing to continue to have a redemption request related to any transferred shares considered by us must resubmit their redemption request. 
  Our board may amend, suspend or terminate the share redemption program upon 30 days  notice to stockholders, provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares pursuant to the share redemption program upon 10 business days  notice.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we fulfilled redemption requests and redeemed shares pursuant to the share redemption program as follows:  
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)     Pursuant to the program, as amended, we will initially redeem shares as follows: 
     For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least one year, 92.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; 
     For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least two years, 95.0% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; 
     For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least three years, 97.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us; and 
     For those shares held by the redeeming stockholder for at least four years, 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us. 
  Notwithstanding the above, upon the death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  of a stockholder, the redemption price will be the amount paid to acquire the shares from us. Furthermore, once we establish an estimated NAV per share of our common stock, the redemption price per share for all stockholders will be equal to the estimated value per share, as determined by our advisor or another firm chosen for that purpose. We expect to establish an estimated NAV per share no later than June 6, 2017.  
   (2)    We limit the dollar value of shares that may be redeemed under the program as described above. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we redeemed $40,000 of common stock, which represented all redemption requests received in good order and eligible for redemption through the September 2016 redemption date. Based on the amount of net proceeds raised from the sale of shares under the dividend reinvestment plan during 2015 and the $0.5 million set aside for stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence, we have $1.1 million available for redemptions during 2016, subject to the limitations described above.

  RELATIONSHIP OF ADVISOR AND COMPANY; 
  OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISOR 
  11.01 Relationship. The Company and the Advisor are not partners or joint venturers with each other, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to make them such partners or joint venturers. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Advisor from engaging in other activities, including, without limitation, the rendering of advice to other Persons (including other REITs) and the management of other programs advised, sponsored or organized by the Advisor or its Affiliates. Nor shall this Agreement limit or restrict the right of any manager, director, officer, employee or equityholder of the Advisor or its Affiliates to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other Person. The Advisor may, with respect to any investment in which the Company is a participant, also render advice and service to each and every other participant therein. The  
  
   24 
  EAST\126969463.2    

Advisor shall promptly disclose to the Board the existence of any condition or circumstance, existing or anticipated, of which it has knowledge, that creates or could create a conflict of interest between the Advisor s obligations to the Company and its obligations to or its interest in any other Person. 
  11.02 Time Commitment. The Advisor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents to, devote to the Company such time as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct the business and affairs of the Company in an appropriate manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the Advisor and its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents may also engage in activities unrelated to the Company and may provide services to Persons other than the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
  11.03 Investment Opportunities and Allocation. The Advisor shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to present a continuing and suitable investment program to the Company that is consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company, but neither the Advisor nor any Affiliate of the Advisor shall be obligated generally to present any particular investment opportunity to the Company even if the opportunity is of character that, if presented to the Company, could be taken by the Company. In the event an investment opportunity is located that may be suitable for the Company and other programs sponsored by the Advisor or any of its Affiliates, including KBS Realty Advisors, the Advisor, in its sole discretion, will have to determine the program or investor for which the investment opportunity is most suitable based on the investment objectives, portfolio and criteria of each program or investor. This determination must be made in a manner that is fair without favoring any other program or investor. The factors that the Advisor shall consider when determining the program or investor for which an investment opportunity would be the most suitable are the following: 
             
    the investment objectives and criteria of each program or investor; 
                
    the cash requirements of each program or investor; 
                
    the effect of the investment on the diversification of each program s or investor s portfolio by type of investment, risk of investment, type of commercial property, geographic location of properties, and tenants of properties and, in the case of debt-related investments, the characteristics of the underlying property; 
                
    the policy of each program or investor relating to leverage; 
                
    the anticipated cash flow of the property or asset to be acquired; 
                
    the income tax effects of the purchase on each program or investor; 
                
    the size of the investment; and 
                
    the amount of funds available to each program or investor and the length of time such funds have been available for investment. 
     
   25 
  EAST\126969463.2    

If a subsequent event or development, such as a delay in the closing of a property or investment or a delay in the construction of a property, causes any investment, in the opinion of the Advisor, to be more appropriate for another program or investor, they may offer the investment to another program or investor. It shall be the duty of the Board to ensure that the allocation method described above is applied fairly to the Company. 
  ARTICLE 12 
  THE KBS NAME 
  The Advisor and its Affiliates have a proprietary interest in the name  KBS.  The Advisor hereby grants to the Company a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive royalty-free right and license to use the name  KBS  during the term of this Agreement. Accordingly, and in recognition of this right, if at any time the Company ceases to retain the Advisor or one of its Affiliates to perform advisory services for the Company, the Company will, promptly after receipt of written request from the Advisor, cease to conduct business under or use the name  KBS  or any derivative thereof and the Company shall change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a name that does not contain the name  KBS  or any other word or words that might, in the reasonable discretion of the Advisor, be susceptible of indication of some form of relationship between the Company and the Advisor or any of its Affiliates. At such time, the Company will also make any changes to any trademarks, servicemarks or other marks necessary to remove any references to the word  KBS.  Consistent with the foregoing, it is specifically recognized that the Advisor or one or more of its Affiliates has in the past and may in the future organize, sponsor or otherwise permit to exist other investment vehicles (including vehicles for investment in real estate) and financial and service organizations having  KBS  as a part of their name, all without the need for any consent (and without the right to object thereto) by the Company.

The defaulting Member shall pay to the non-defaulting Member such reimbursement within ten (10) days of the non-defaulting Member s written request therefor, which request shall reasonably substantiate the costs and expenses incurred.  If the defaulting Member is (i) KBS Member then KBS SOR US Properties II LLC (the    KBS Credit Party   ) shall guaranty the payment of the Reimbursable Expenses incurred by JV Member, or (ii) JV Member then KEK Family Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability  

company (the    JV Member Credit Party   ) shall guaranty the Reimbursable Expenses incurred by KBS Member.  Except as provided in   Section 1.05   above, if the Property Closing does not otherwise occur and the Purchase Deposit is returned to the Property Owner Subsidiary, then the Company shall be dissolved pursuant to   Article VIII  .  
  3.02.        Default in Capital Commitment  .  If JV Member or KBS Member (as applicable, the    Defaulting Member   )     shall fail to contribute its share of any amounts required to be contributed pursuant to Section 3.01 or any approved additional capital contributions pursuant to Section 3.06 (the    Defaulted Amount   ) and such failure shall continue for at least five (5) business days following notice to the Defaulting Member (provided that no notice or cure period shall apply to a Member s failure to fund its share of the required capital to the Company for the Property Closing pursuant to the Purchase Agreement), KBS Member or JV Member, as applicable, (the    Non-Defaulting Member(s)   ) may, but shall not be obligated to, contribute some or all of the Defaulted Amount as a capital contribution to the Company or as a loan to the Defaulting Member (a    Default Loan   ).  If the Non-Defaulting Member elects to contribute some or all of the Defaulted Amount as a capital contribution to the Company, then the Percentage Interests of KBS Member and the JV Member shall be adjusted as follows: (a) the amount which the Non-Defaulting Member elects to contribute to fund the Defaulted Amount shall be deemed to be equal to 150% of the amount that the Non-Defaulting Member actually funds (the    Deemed Capital    (b) the Non-Defaulting Member s Percentage Interest shall be equal to the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the aggregate capital contributed  by the Non-Defaulting Member, exclusive of the amount funded to replace the Defaulted Amount, plus the Deemed Capital, and the denominator of which is the total capital contributed by all Members, other than the amount contributed to replace the Defaulted Amount, plus the Deemed Capital; and (c) the Defaulting Member s Percentage Interest shall equal 100% minus the recomputed Percentage Interest of the Non-Defaulting Member.  If the Non-Defaulting Member elects to provide the Default Loan, then it shall pay the proceeds directly to the Company.  A Default Loan shall not be considered a capital contribution by the Non-Defaulting Member and shall not increase the Capital Account balance or the Percentage Interest of the Non-Defaulting Member, but instead shall be treated as a non-recourse loan by the Non-Defaulting Member to the Defaulting Member (and a capital contribution by the Defaulting Member) and shall bear interest at the lesser of (x) the Default Loan Rate (as defined below) or (y) the maximum amount permitted by law.  To the extent not repaid directly by the Defaulting Member, a Default Loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be repaid out of any subsequent distributions of Net Cash or any other payment from the Company to which the Defaulting Member would otherwise be entitled (but such distributions actually paid to the lending Members shall nonetheless constitute a distribution to the Defaulting Member for purposes of this Agreement), and such payments shall be applied first to the payment of accrued but unpaid interest on each such obligation and then to the payment of the outstanding principal until the Default Loan is paid in full.     Default Loan Rate    is defined as a cumulative annual rate equal to twenty percent (20%), compounded quarterly (pro-rated for periods of less than one year), on the daily average outstanding balance during each fiscal year of the Member s aggregate unreturned Default Loan.  
  3.03.        Member Loans  .  In the event Managing Member determines, in its reasonable discretion, that funds in addition to those otherwise obtained pursuant to Section 3.01 are necessary  

for the Company or any Subsidiary to meet the Annual Budget, Business Plan or required to pay Necessary Costs, then Managing Member shall deliver written notice of such actual or projected cash deficit to the Members requesting that they agree that a loan (a    Member Loan   ) should be made to the Company, which notice shall specify the term and interest rate of the requested Member Loan.  Within 10 business days following the effective date of such notice, each such Member shall notify Managing Member (a) whether or not such Member agrees that Member Loan(s) to the Company should be made in the amount specified in Managing Member s notice, and (b) whether such Member elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, to make such Member Loan.  If all Members (y) agree that a Member Loan in the amount specified in Managing Member s notice should be made, and (z) elect to advance such funds by the Company, such funds shall be advanced by Members in proportion to their respective percentage set forth opposite such Member's name under the column labeled  Percentage Interest  on Exhibit A attached hereto, as such Percentage Interests may be adjusted under this Agreement (the    Percentage Interests   ) (or as such Members otherwise agree).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if KBS Member elects that the Member Loan should be made but the JV Member does not, the KBS Member may elect to make the entire Member Loan or such portion as it may so elect.  Any and all advances made by any Member to the Company pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be treated as a Member Loan with recourse only to the assets of the Company (and not to the assets of any Member), and shall bear annual interest as set forth in Managing Member s notice.  Furthermore, the Company and the KBS Member shall structure any Member Loan from the KBS Member such that the Member Loan is, at all times, a  real estate asset  under Section 856(c) of the Code.  If, from any circumstances whatsoever, the Company ever receives as interest under a Member Loan in an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance due under such Member Loan and not to the payment of interest.  Any and all Member Loans shall be due and payable from the first available funds of the Company and in any event upon the liquidation of the Company.  The repayment of any Member Loan shall be made prior to any distributions of Net Cash or other cash proceeds to the Members.  Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles V and VIII, until any and all Member Loans are repaid in full, the Members shall draw no further distributions from the Company and all cash or property otherwise distributable with respect to the Interests of the Members shall be paid to the Member(s) making Member Loan(s) in proportion to, and as a reduction of, the outstanding balance(s) of such Member Loan(s), with such funds being applied first to reduce any interest accrued thereon, and then to reduce the principal amount thereof.  As used in this Agreement, the term    Interest    means in respect to any Member, all of such Member s right, title and interest in and to the Net Profits, Net Losses, Net Cash, and capital of the Company, and any and all other interests therein in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Act.  As used in this Agreement, the terms    Net Profits    and    Net Losses    mean, for each fiscal year or other period, an amount equal to the Company s taxable income or loss, as the case may be, for such year or period, determined in accordance with Code Section 703(a) (for this purpose, all items of income, gain, loss and deduction required to be stated separately pursuant to Code Section 703(a)(1) shall be included in taxable income or loss); provided, however, for purposes of computing such taxable income or loss, (i) such taxable income or loss shall be adjusted by any and all adjustments required to be made in order to maintain Capital Account balances in compliance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b), and (ii) any and all items of gross income or gain and/or partnership and/or partner  nonrecourse deductions  specially allocated to any Member pursuant to Section 4.02 shall not be taken into  

account in calculating such taxable income or loss.  If KBS Member does not approve a Member Loan other than a Member Loan for Necessary Costs, such disapproval shall be deemed final and conclusive for all purposes.  As used in this Agreement, the term    Necessary Costs    mean amounts necessary to timely pay (i) real estate taxes, utility costs, insurance premiums, costs to comply with legal requirements as to the Property or other similar non-discretionary expenses as to the Property, and (ii) scheduled payments of debt service on Financings to the Company or the Property Owner Subsidiary (but not payments of principal due at maturity or by acceleration of any such loan or prepayments of principal  thereunder). 
  3.04.        Determination of IRR Returns and Equity Multiple  . 
  (a)      IRR Return  .  The IRR Return described in   Section 5.01   below shall be determined based upon internal rate of return of KBS Member and JV Member.  As used in this Agreement, the term    IRR Return    means for each of KBS Member and JV Member the annual discount rate that when compounded quarterly results in a net present value equal to zero when the discount rate is applied to all capital contributions by KBS Member and all distributions made by the Company to KBS Member pursuant to this Agreement.  The IRR Return shall be calculated using the XIRR function provided in Microsoft Office Excel or any replacement software issued by Microsoft to compute internal rate of return. It is understood by the Members that the achievement of a particular IRR Return requires both a return of all capital contributions plus a cumulative return on such capital contributions at the applicable percentage IRR Return. 
  (b)      Equity Multiple  .  The    Equity Multiple    described in   Section 5.01   below shall equal all actual distributions made by the Company to KBS Member pursuant to this Agreement divided by all of KBS Member s capital contributions to the Company. 
  3.05.        Capital Contributions in General  .  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as otherwise agreed to by all Members in writing (i) no Member may withdraw all or any portion of any contribution that such Member may have made to the capital of the Company without each other Member s consent, (ii) no Member shall be entitled to receive interest on such Member s contributions to the capital of the Company, and (iii) no Member shall be required or entitled to contribute additional capital to the Company 
  3.06.        Additional Capital Contributions  . Following the contribution of all the amounts described in   Section 3.01  , either Member shall have the right to make a capital call by delivering written notice to the other Member under this   Section 3.06   if and only if such additional capital was either (1) set forth in the approved Annual Budget or Interim Annual Budget, as applicable, (2) otherwise approved as a Major Decision pursuant to   Section 2.02  , (3) pay for Necessary Costs, (4) Cost Overruns (other than any Cost Overruns governed by   Section 3.07(c)(iii)(1)  ), or (5) if such Member, in its reasonable judgement concludes that the expenditure of funds is necessary (A) to avoid imminent material damage to all or any material portion of the Property, or (B) to protect the safety of any person at the Property from imminent harm, or (C) to avoid the imminent suspension of any necessary material service in or to the Property, provided, however that the approval of the KBS Member shall be required for a capital call with respect to Subsections (3) and (5) unless the failure to undertake the action in Subsections (3) or (5) is necessary to prevent a breach under a Financing that would reasonably be expected to trigger liability under any Guaranty  

(including the Completion Guaranty), provided such breach was not caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or acts taken in bad faith of JV Member or any of its Affiliates.  Each Member shall contribute its share of the additional capital contributions required to be contributed under this   Section 3.06   (in accordance with its Percentage Interest) in cash on or before the due date specified in the written notice, which due date shall be no less than ten (10) business days from the date of this written notice.  If a Member fails to make its share of the additional capital contributions required to be contributed on or before the due date specified in Managing Member s written notice, the Non-Defaulting Member shall have the right (but not the obligation and without waiving any remedies hereunder as a result of such failure) to receive a return of all or part of the additional Capital Contribution made by the Non-Defaulting Member, to make a Default Loan or to make a capital contribution to the Company of some or all of the Defaulted Amount pursuant to   Section 3.02  .

If a Purchase Election is timely made, the purchase price for the Offering Member s Interest shall be the amount the Offering Member would receive if the Project were to be sold for the Proposed Project Value and the proceeds distributed upon a liquidation of the Company had the Project been sold for the Proposed Project Value as provided in this Agreement.

  (c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing and provided that a Purchase Default Event has not occurred, if as a result of the Offering Member s marketing efforts, the Offering Member receives a bona fide offer from a third party purchaser and desires to sell the Project in a sale that will result in a purchase price that is less than ninety five percent (95%) of the Proposed Project Value, the Offering Member shall deliver a revised Sale Notice to the Purchasing Member, which shall set forth the new proposed sales price for the Project, and the Purchasing Member shall have twenty (20) business days following receipt of the revised Sale Notice to make a Purchase Election in the manner described in   Section 7.01(a)   above in lieu of having the Project sold.

SMRH:479313556.2 

solely as provided in this Agreement and the written agreement between Owner and the Property Manager.  
  3.  Property Manager. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but without intending to limit the nature and scope of the services to be provided by Asset Manager under this Agreement, it is agreed and understood that Owner shall engage the services of (a) a property management company (the "  Property Manager  ") pursuant to a property management agreement and (b) one or more leasing agents, pursuant to one or more leasing brokerage agreements, and if Owner shall determine in its sole discretion, Owner may retain or cause to be retained one or more professional consultants to perform significant services on behalf of the Property, including, without limitation, environmental consultants, engineers, construction contractors, SOC 1 consultants, accountants, architects, tax certiorari counsel, leasing counsel and insurance agents.

ARTICLE XII      CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION 
  Promptly upon learning thereof, Seller shall give Purchaser written notice of any condemnation, damage or destruction of the Property occurring prior to the Closing.  If prior to the Closing all or any portion of the Property is condemned, damaged or destroyed by an insured casualty, Purchaser shall have the option of either (i) proceeding to Closing without a reduction on the Purchase Price and applying the proceeds of any condemnation award or payment under any insurance policies (other than business interruption or rental loss insurance) toward the payment of the Purchase Price to the extent such condemnation awards or insurance payments have been received by Seller, receiving from Seller an amount equal to any applicable deductible under any such insurance policy and receiving an assignment from Seller of Seller s right, title and interest in any such awards or payments not theretofore received by Seller; or (ii) terminating this Agreement by delivering written notice of such termination to Seller and Escrow Agent within ten (10) days after Purchaser has received written notice from Seller of such material condemnation, damage or destruction.  If, prior to the Closing, a portion of the Property is condemned, damaged or destroyed and such portion is not a material portion of the Property, the proceeds of any condemnation award or payment and any applicable deductible under any insurance policies shall be applied toward the payment of the Purchase Price to the extent such condemnation awards or insurance payments have been received by Seller and Seller shall assign to Purchaser all of Seller s right, title and interest in any unpaid awards or payments.  For purposes of this   Article XII  , the term  material portion  shall mean greater than three and one half percent (3.5%) of the Purchase Price or a material and adverse impact on the operation or use of the Property (including, in the case of condemnation, loss of access to the parking area of the Property).  If the damage or destruction arises out of an uninsured (or underinsured) risk, Seller shall elect, by written notice within ten (10) days of the occurrence of such damage or destruction either to terminate this Agreement or to close the transaction contemplated hereby with a reduction of the Purchase Price equal to the costs of repairing the Property, as reasonably estimated by an engineer engaged by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

EXECUTION VERSION 

maintenance and repair, (c) required by any of the Leases or the Contracts, or (d) required by this Agreement;

  (iii)        change or attempt to change, directly or indirectly, the current zoning of the Real Property in a manner materially adverse to it; 
  (iv)        cancel, amend or modify, in a manner materially adverse to the Property, any license or permit held by Seller with respect to the Property or any part thereof which would be binding upon Purchaser after the Closing; 
  (v)        remove any Personal Property except in the ordinary course of business as may be required for necessary repair or replacement;  
  (vi)        stop maintaining in full force and effect fire and commercial general liability insurance on the Property which is at least equivalent in all material respects to the insurance policies covering the Property as of the Effective Date; or 
  (vii)        agree to pay third party brokers any commissions for any Leases entered into after the Effective Date, which commission is not fully paid for by Seller prior to the Closing Date. 
  13.3        New Leases and Contracts  .  Seller may enter into any new lease (on its standard lease form and as long as consistent with current market terms) or contract without Purchaser s consent so long as: (i) Seller provides Purchaser prior written notice of such lease and (ii) such leases are entered into in accordance with Seller s past practices, at current market rents, on Seller s standard lease form and for a length of term no longer than one (1) year (with respect to residential leases); provided, however, in no event shall Seller enter into a new lease, renew or otherwise modify the current lease for Unit 131 other than allowing the tenant in Unit 131 to move into Unit 132.  Seller may not enter into any new non-residential leases or amend any existing non-residential leases without receiving Purchaser s prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion.   Notwithstanding the preceding sentence Seller may only enter into any new contracts without Purchaser s consent if doing so is in the ordinary course of operating the Property and the contract (i) will not be binding on Purchaser; or (ii) is cancelable on thirty (30) days or less notice without penalty or premium. 
  13.4        Confidentiality  .  Seller and Purchaser shall, prior to the Closing, maintain the confidentiality of this sale and purchase and shall not, except as required by law or governmental regulation applicable to Seller or Purchaser, disclose the terms of this Agreement or of such sale

  16.9        Assignment by Purchaser  .  Purchaser may not assign its rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser reserves the right to take title to the Property in the name of an affiliate, or in the name of one or more institutional investors for which Purchaser or one of its affiliates is then acting as investment manager; provided Purchaser delivers to Seller written notice of its intention to do so no less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing including the legal name and structure of the assignee.

  ARTICLE XVII      ESCROW AGENT DUTIES AND DISPUTES 
  17.1        Other Duties of Escrow Agent  .  Escrow Agent shall not be bound in any way by any other agreement or contract between Seller and Purchaser, whether or not Escrow Agent has knowledge thereof.  Escrow Agent s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Deposit shall be to hold the Deposit and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Deposit and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Deposit and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Deposit or for any diminution in value of the Deposit from any cause, other than Escrow Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Escrow Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Purchaser, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants.  Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Escrow Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Escrow Agent. 
  17.2        Disputes  .  Escrow Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Deposit.  If there is any dispute as to whether Escrow Agent is obligated to deliver the Deposit or as to whom the Deposit is to be delivered, Escrow Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Deposit until receipt by Escrow Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Deposit, or, in the absence of authorization, Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding.  Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity or validity of any notice, instruction, instrument, document or other item delivered to it, and it shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written notice, direction or instruction given to it under this Agreement and believed by it to be authentic.  If written authorization is not given, or proceedings for a determination are not begun, within thirty (30) days after the date scheduled for the closing of title and diligently continued, Escrow Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the Deposit with a court of the State of pending a determination.  Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred in its capacity as Escrow Agent, by the party determined not to be entitled to the Deposit.  Upon making delivery of the Deposit in the manner provided in this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall have no further liability  

EXECUTION VERSION 

hereunder.  In no event shall Escrow Agent be under any duty to institute, defend or participate in any proceeding that may arise between Seller and Purchaser in connection with the Deposit. 
  17.3        Reports  .  Escrow Agent shall be responsible for the timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  Holdback Escrow Agreement 

THIS HOLDBACK ESCROW AGREEMENT (this    Agreement   ) is made and entered into as of the ___ day of [_____], 2016, by and among [_______________________](   Seller   ), [_______________________] (   Purchaser   ), and [_____________________________] (   Escrow Holder   ). 
  RECITALS 
  A.     Seller, Purchaser and Escrow Holder entered into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated [_________], 2016 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the    Purchase Agreement   ).  
  B.    Pursuant to Purchase Agreement, Purchaser is acquiring the interests of Seller in the property described therein (the    Property   ).  Each capitalized term not defined herein shall have the respective meaning given to that term in the Purchase Agreement. 
  C.     Section 16.8.2 of the Purchase Agreement provides, in part, that, upon the Closing, the Escrow Sum will be deposited into the Escrow (as hereinafter defined) for purposes of securing payment and performance of the Mandated Improvement Work.  It is the understanding of Seller and Purchaser that Seller and/or its insurance company shall continue working towards a final settlement agreement of the UFAS Litigation (the  Settlement Agreement ) after Closing directly upon terms as further outlined in the attached   Exhibit 1  , provided that Seller agrees to provide notice to Purchaser of any status updates or other notifications it receives and Purchaser covenants and agrees to execute the Settlement Agreement if ultimately required by the court. Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement, Seller and Purchaser will jointly retain Christy Kim (the  Consultant ) at Seller s sole cost and expense, to assist Seller and Purchaser in agreeing upon a reasonable estimate of the total costs plus an additional 25% for Purchaser oversight of the Mandated Improvement Work (collectively, the  Improvement Cost Amount ) to complete the Mandated Improvement Work. In estimating the Improvement Cost Amount, Seller and Purchaser agree that the most cost-effective solutions (consistent with the current fit and finish of the Property and utilizing units with existing UFAS features where possible) shall be used for completion of the Mandated Improvement Work.  
  D.      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement is not intended to modify or alter in any way the obligations of the parties under the Purchase Agreement. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above Recitals and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller and Purchaser hereby agree as follows: 
  1.       Deposit; Investment of Funds  . 
  
   208130846 v9 

(a)     Upon the Closing under the Purchase Agreement, The Escrow Sum shall be deposited into an account maintained by the Escrow Holder (the    Escrow   ). Such amount, plus any interest, dividends and other proceeds earned on all escrowed funds, shall at all times remain in the Escrow except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.  
  (b)    Escrow Holder shall invest all escrowed funds in an interest-bearing bank account at a bank that Purchaser and Seller approve, or in such other investments as shall be approved in writing by Seller and Purchaser.  The Escrow Holder is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions required under this Agreement.  The Escrow Holder shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any investment or sale of investment made pursuant to this Agreement.  The Escrow Holder is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal in good faith with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Holder or for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account.  The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Holder is not providing investment supervision, recommendations or advice. 
  (c)     All interest, dividends and other income or proceeds earned on the Escrow Sum shall be treated as part of the Escrow Sum and shall be disbursed as provided herein.  Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be liable in any manner to the other as a result of any investment decision made, or any approval of or failure to approve any investment decision, with respect to the Escrow. 
  2.       Disbursement of Escrow Sum and Indemnity  .  Within two (2) business days after issuance of a final court order with respect to the UFAS Litigation or the execution of the Settlement Agreement and agreement by Seller and Purchaser (in consultation with the Consultant) of the Improvement Cost Amount, Escrow Holder shall promptly disburse from the Escrow Sum to Purchaser the Improvement Cost Amount, with the remainder of the Escrow Sum, if any, going to Seller. Purchaser covenants and agrees, following the disbursement of the Improvement Cost Amount to Purchaser, to complete the Mandated Improvement Work in a lien free manner and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its respective affiliates, members, partners, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, directors and agents from any loss, injury, damage, cause of action, liability, claim, lien, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys  fees and costs arising from any claims relating to the Mandated Improvement Work under the Settlement Agreement or any defects related thereto.  
  3.       Controversies  .  In the event that any controversy arises between the Parties hereto or with any third person, Escrow Holder shall not be required to make any determination of the same or take any action with regard to the same, but may await settlement of the controversy by mutual instructions of the parties or by appropriate legal or arbitration proceedings. 
  4.      Compensation  .  Escrow Holder shall be entitled to compensation for its services in the amount of $_______________, which compensation shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser.  The fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full compensation for Escrow Holder's services as contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Agreement are not fulfilled or Escrow Holder renders any services not contemplated in this Agreement or the Escrow Holder  

is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, Escrow Holder shall be compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation, or event. 
  5.       Harmless  .  Seller and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally promise and agree to pay promptly on demand and to indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Holder from and against all costs, damages, judgments, attorneys  fees, expenses, obligations and liabilities of every kind which in good faith are incurred or suffered by the Escrow Holder in connection with or arising out of the Escrow (it being expressly understood and agreed, however, that nothing in this Section 4 shall alter or impair the right of Seller or Purchaser to recover from the other any amount due from one to the other with respect to sums paid to Escrow Holder pursuant to this Section 4). 
  6.       Notices  . 
   (a)     Whenever any notice, demand, request or other communication is required or permitted hereunder, such notice, demand, request or communication shall be made in writing and shall be personally delivered to the addresses set forth in the Purchase Agreement, sent via prepaid courier or telecopier, or deposited in the United States mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the addresses set forth in the Purchase Agreement (with respect to Seller or Purchaser), and any notices to Escrow Holder shall be sent to: 
  (b)     Except as provided in subsection (c), below, any notice, demand, request or other communication sent in the manner specified in this Section 6 shall be deemed to have been delivered upon receipt by the person to whom such notice was addressed. 
  (c)    The inability to deliver any notice, demand or request because the individual to whom it is properly addressed in accordance with this Section 6 refuses delivery thereof or no longer can be located at that address shall constitute delivery thereof to such individual. 
  (d)     Each party hereto shall have the right from time to time to designate by written notice to the other parties thereto such other person or persons and such other place or places as said party may desire written notices to be delivered or sent in accordance herewith. 
  7.       Modification  .  No provision of this Agreement may be modified, amended, supplemented or terminated nor may the obligations of the parties hereunder be waived except by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto or their respective successors in interest. 
  8.       Charges  .  Except as otherwise provided herein, all charges and expenses of Escrow are to be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller.   
  9.       Governing Law  .  This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein shall be construed in accordance with and governed by laws of the State of Louisiana, without giving effect to the conflict-of-law rules and principles of said state. 

10.       Incorporation of Prior Agreements  .  This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement and any documents delivered in connection therewith, contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and no other prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreement or understanding pertaining to any such matter shall be effective for any purpose.  The parties do not intend to confer any benefit hereunder on any person, corporation or firm other than the parties hereto or their permitted successors and assigns. 
  11.       Costs and Attorneys  Fees  .  If any legal action or any arbitration or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or if Escrow Holder commences any action with respect to the Escrow, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover actual attorneys  fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding (together with costs of enforcing any judgments or rulings), in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled. 
  12.       Conflict  .  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. 
  13.       Time of Essence  .  All terms provided for in this Agreement for the performance of any act will be strictly construed, time being of essence. 
  14.       Further Assurances  .  Purchaser and Seller agree to execute such further instructions to Escrow Holder and such other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement. 
  15.       Counterparts  .  This Agreement, and any document or instrument entered into, given or made pursuant to this Agreement or authorized hereby, and any amendment or supplement thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts, and, when so executed, will have the same force and effect as though all signatures appeared on a single document.  Any signature page of this Agreement or of such an amendment, supplement, document or instrument may be detached from any counterpart without impairing the legal effect of any signatures thereon, and may be attached to another counterpart identical in form thereto but having attached to it one or more additional signature pages. 
  16.       Severability  .  If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, unconscionable or unenforceable, all of the other terms, provisions and selections hereof will nevertheless remain effective and be in force to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
  17.       Construction of Agreement  .  The language in all parts of this Agreement shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto, despite the fact that the Agreement may have been prepared in whole or part by one party or its counsel.  Headings at the beginning of paragraphs and subparagraphs of this Agreement are solely for the convenience of the parties and are not a part of this Agreement.  When required by the context, whenever the singular number is used in this Agreement, the same shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa.

     Effective Date    means the date upon which fee title to the Property shall be conveyed to Assignee. 
      ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION 
  Assignment  .  Assignor hereby assigns and transfers to Assignee all of Assignor s right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Interests, without recourse, representation or warranty. 
  Acceptance and Assumption  .  Assignee hereby accepts the foregoing assignment and transfer from Assignor, and Assignee hereby assumes and agrees to perform all of the Assumed Obligations which first arise or occur from and after the Effective Date, and to be bound by, and to comply from and after the Effective Date with, all of the terms and provisions of the OPA to the extent same relate to the Assigned Interests and the Assumed Obligations. 

Effect of Assignment  .  From and after the Effective Date: (a) Assignee shall be deemed a party to the OPA and any reference therein to  Developer  shall be deemed to refer to Assignee to the extent said reference relates to the Property, the Assigned Interests and/or the Assumed Obligations; (b) Assignee shall be entitled to exercise and enforce all rights to the Assigned Interests under the OPA as if Assignee had been a signatory to the OPA or a beneficiary thereunder as of the date of its original execution and Assignor shall no longer have any entitlement thereto; (c) CRA/LA shall release Assignee, its successors and assigns and the Property from all obligations, restrictions and requirements described in the OPA except for the Assumed Obligations; and (d) Assignor is released by CRA/LA from the obligations related to the Property, the Assigned Interests and/or the OPA (to the extent applicable to the Property) in each case to the extent first arising or accruing after the Effective Date. 
  Consent to Amendment  .  From and after the Effective Date, any future amendment of the OPA which does not affect any of the Property, the Assigned Interests, or the Assumed Obligations, shall not require the consent or signature of Assignee.  In addition, in the event CRA/LA has received written notice of the existence of a Lender (as defined in Section 3.6, below) from Assignee, then from and after the Effective Date, CRA/LA shall make a good faith effort to provide written notification to such Lender, at least ten (10) days prior to executing any proposed amendments or modifications to any of the provisions of the OPA which are binding on the Assignee Property.   
      CRA/LA CONSENT 
  Consent to Assignment  .  CRA/LA consents to:  (i) the assignment of Assignor s interest in the Property and the OPA to Assignee, (ii) the assignment, transfer and/or hypothecation of Assignee s interest in the Property and the OPA as security for any Lender financing and (iii) any future assignment of the Property and the OPA by Assignee to any Lender.

  No Breach of the Assumed Obligations  .  CRA/LA hereby certifies to Assignee and to Lender that  Assignor is not currently in default of any of its obligations  with regards to Subarea B-2.  CRA/LA acknowledges that Assignee is entering into this Agreement in reliance upon said certification and that  CRA/LA shall hereafter be estopped from pursuing any rights or remedies against Assignee or Lender in connection with any alleged breach of an Assumed Obligation prior to the date hereof; notwithstanding this certification, however, CRA/LA does not waive any rights it may have against Assignor for any such alleged breach. 
  Waiver and Release of Claims  . 
  CRA/LA hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Effective Date, Assignee (and its successors) shall only be responsible for (and the Property shall only be bound and encumbered by) the Assumed Obligations, and from and after the Effective Date, CRA/LA expressly, fully and forever releases and discharges Assignee and the Property from any and all losses, expenses, claims, costs, damages, debts, attorneys  fees, actions, suits, judgments, awards,  

obligations and/or liabilities of any kind, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, with respect to or in any way relating to or arising out of the Retained Obligations (as defined in the Subarea B-2 Assignment), the Assignor Property (as defined in the Subarea B-1 Assignment) and/or any and all obligations assumed by (i) the Subarea A Assignee or Subarea C Assignee and/or relating to the  Assignee Property  as defined in the Subarea A Assignment or Subarea C Assignment, as applicable, or (ii) Subarea B-1 Assignee and/or relating to the  Property  as defined in the Subarea B-1 Assignment. 
  CRA/LA acknowledges and agrees, and without limiting the terms of any release and/or other partial termination previously executed, delivered and/or recorded by CRA/LA or in respect of the Property (or any portion thereof) that except for the rights and obligations specifically enumerated in the Subarea B-2 Assignment with respect to Subarea B-2, no other portion of the OPA is applicable to the Property.  CRA/LA acknowledges and agrees that the HUD Loan (as defined in the Subarea B-2 Assignment) does not impact or encumber the Property and reaffirms its release of the Assignor and Assignee (together with its successors, assigns and/or lenders) and the Property from any remedies which might be construed as in any way relating to or arising out of a default of the HUD Loan or any other financing contemplated under the OPA. CRA/LA further acknowledges and agrees that any Agency Participation Payment which was payable under the OPA in respect of the sale of any portion of the Property has been previously paid in full by Assignor s predecessors in interest and that no Agency Participation Payment shall be due in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Sale, Purchase and Escrow Agreement dated as of [_________], 2016, between Redrock Residential Noho, LLC and [____________] with respect to the sale of the Property (as amended from time to time, the    Purchase Agreement   ).   
  No Cross Default  .  CRA/LA hereby acknowledges that: 
  In the event the Subarea A Assignee defaults on any of the obligations assigned under the Subarea A Assignment, then CRA/LA shall have no rights or remedies against Assignee or the Property and, to the extent that such a default would entitle CRA/LA to terminate the OPA, then CRA/LA shall have no right to terminate the OPA to the extent it relates to Subarea B-2 or the Subarea B-2 Improvements, including without limitation, any of the Assigned Interests. 
  In the event the Subarea B-1 Assignee defaults on any of the obligations assigned under the Subarea B-1 Assignment, then CRA/LA shall have no rights or remedies against Assignee or the Property and, to the extent that such a default would entitle CRA/LA to terminate the OPA, then CRA/LA shall have no right to terminate the OPA to the extent it relates to Subarea B-2 or the Subarea B-2 Improvements, including without limitation, any of the Assigned Interests. 
  In the event the Subarea C Assignee defaults on any of the obligations assigned under the Subarea C Assignment, then CRA/LA shall have no rights or remedies against Assignee or the Property and, to the extent that such a default would entitle CRA/LA to terminate the OPA, then CRA/LA shall have no right to terminate the OPA to the extent it relates to Subarea B-2 or the Subarea B-2 Improvements, including without limitation, any of the Assigned Interests. 

In the event Developer defaults on any obligations relating to Subarea D, then CRA/LA shall have no right to terminate the OPA to the extent it relates to Subarea B-2 or the Subarea B-2 Improvements, including without limitation, any of the Assigned Interests. 
  Consent to Financing and Security Interest  .  CRA/LA hereby acknowledges and agrees that Assignee, and any successors to Assignee, shall have the right, at any time and without notice to or the need for approval from CRA/LA, to encumber all or any portion of the Property. 
  Lender Reliance  .  Each Party hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that any lender to Assignee (   Lender   ) shall have the right to rely on the contents and provisions of this Agreement and that such lender will rely on such content and provisions in connection with its loan to Assignee. 
      MISCELLANEOUS

  Survival  .  All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Parties hereunder shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Parties and shall survive the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all other documents contemplated herein. 
  Successors and Assigns  .  This Agreement, including, without limitation, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein (a) shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted successors, assigns and transferees, and (b) shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Parties and their respective successors, assigns and transferees.

  Counterpart Execution  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of which together shall  

constitute one Agreement binding on all of the Parties.  Any signature delivered by facsimile or telecopier shall be deemed to constitute an original signature hereto. 
  Amendments; Waivers  .

  Litigation/Administrative Proceedings 
  [Attached hereto] 

Pending Litigation - 
  The Lofts at Noho Commons 
  1.    HUD Administrative Complaints 
  Each of the following complaints alleges disability discrimination and failure to accommodate by providing the complainant with an accessible apartment. Each of the complainants is of limited income, and requires an apartment in the affordable housing program. The first two (Burns and Stansell) are not on the affordable housing waitlist, which is closed. The last (Ling) is on the waitlist, and was offered an affordable apartment at one time, but rejected it because of its size. 
  Each of these three is under investigation by HUD to determine whether there is cause to believe any unlawful discrimination has occurred. 
  Patrick Burns v. Redrock Noho Residential, LLC 
  HUD Case No. 09-13-0139-8 
  Daniel Stansell v. Redrock Noho Residential, LLC 
  HUD Case No. 09-13-0685-8 
  Mei Ling v. Redrock Noho Residential LLC 
  HUD Case No. 09-13-0686-8 
  (Note: This is the second administrative complaint filed by Ling against the Lofts. The first was dismissed with  no cause  by HUD. The current complaint was filed - with identical allegations - after Ling s federal court litigation on the same subject was dismissed by summary judgment;   see Ling v. City of Los Angeles, below.  ) 
  7/26/16 Update: I have heard nothing further from HUD on these complaints. I understand they are still pending with HUD, and HUD considers them  open  investigations, but nothing is happening on them with regard to anything the Respondents must do. 
  2. Federal Court Litigation 
  Mei Ling v. City of Los Angeles, Redrock Noho Residential, LLC et al. 
  Docket No. 2:11-cv-07774 (C.D. CA) 
  on appeal as: 
  Mei Ling v. City of Los Angeles, Redrock Noho Residential, LLC et al. 
  Docket No. 12-57263 (9th Cir.) 
  In this lawsuit, Ling alleges that Redrock failed to reasonably accommodate her disability by providing her a one-bedroom apartment at the Lofts. Ling is of limited income, and only qualifies for the  affordable  units at the Lofts. The designated  affordable  units at this property are all studio units; the only one bedroom plan is only available as a market rate unit. Ling requests that she be offered a one bedroom unit at the affordable rate. 

The United States District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment on all of Ling s claims in November 2012. Ling appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Briefing has been complete in the Ninth Circuit since February 2014, and oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for February 4, 2015. 
  7/26/16 Update: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment by order of March 5, 2015. No further appeal was taken by Ling, and the matter is closed. 
  Independent Living Center et al. v. City of Los Angeles, Redrock Noho Residential, LLC et al. 
  Docket No. 2:12-cv-00551-FMO-PJW (C.D. CA) 
  This lawsuit was filed in 2012 by three different disabled advocacy groups. The advocacy groups allege that the City of Los Angeles did not ensure that its receipt and use of federal funds complied with the obligations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the advocacy groups allege the City failed to ensure funds used for construction and renovation of housing included adequate provision of housing accessible for people with disabilities. 
  The plaintiffs in this action have named 61 owners of housing that allegedly received City funds for construction or renovation as  necessary  parties, meaning they are necessary to obtain full resolution of the complaint. Specifically, the plaintiffs named the Owner Defendants (Redrock Noho Residential, LLC is one) to ensure that the Court could order physical modifications to the properties as necessary. 
  The Owner Defendants have made substantial efforts to achieve settlement as to their participation in the case. The Plaintiffs are not seeking any monetary relief from the Owner Defendants, and the City s cross-claims against the Owner Defendants were dismissed by the Court. On January 21, 2015, the Court entered a 90 day stay of the litigation on representations from the plaintiffs and the City that they intended to engage in substantive, global settlement negotiations. The Owner Defendants will participate in those negotiations. 
  7/26/16 Update: I do not represent the Lofts at Noho Commons in this litigation; Bill Goines from Greenburg Traurig is insurance defense counsel. However, I have been in close contact with Bill, and I do represent other Owner Defendants in this action. In July 2015, the Plaintiffs announced they had reached settlement with the City that needed to be approved by the Mayor and City Council, then the Court. That approval is pending. 
  Under the settlement, the City would provide funds to reach a target goal of a certain number of accessible units over a ten year period, and would require all properties it funds to adopt and implement certain policies and procedures. However, 22 properties were specifically excluded from the settlement because of the involvement of the CRA, and Lofts at Noho is one of those properties. The litigation continues against the CRA, and the outcome for the Lofts at Noho Commons is presumed to be essentially the same as for the other Owner Defendants.
