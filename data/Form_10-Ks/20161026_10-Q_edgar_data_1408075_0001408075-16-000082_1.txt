NOTE 1   GENERAL INFORMATION    
    
  Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Graphic Packaging Holding Company ( GPHC  and, together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ) is committed to providing consumer packaging that makes a world of difference. The Company is a leading provider of paper-based packaging solutions for a wide variety of products to food, beverage and other consumer products companies. The Company operates on a global basis and is one of the largest producers of folding cartons in the United States ("U.S.") and holds leading market positions in coated unbleached kraft paperboard ("CUK") and coated-recycled paperboard ("CRB").      
    
  The Company s customers include many of the world s most widely recognized companies and brands with prominent market positions in beverage, food and other consumer products.  The Company strives to provide its customers with packaging solutions designed to deliver marketing and performance benefits at a competitive cost by capitalizing on its low-cost paperboard mills and converting plants, its proprietary carton and packaging designs, and its commitment to quality and service. 
    
  GPHC conducts no significant business and has no independent assets or operations other than its ownership of all of Graphic Packaging International, Inc.'s ("GPII'") outstanding common stock. 
    
  The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company has the ability to exercise direct or indirect control over operating and financial policies.  Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  In the Company s opinion, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. The Company s year end Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and do not include all the information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with GPHC s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In addition, the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. 
    
  For a summary of the Company s significant accounting policies, please refer to GPHC s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Accounts Receivable and Allowances 

The Company has entered into agreements for the purchasing and servicing of receivables to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third party financial institution.  Transfers under these agreements meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with the   Transfers and Servicing   topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (the "Codification").  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , the Company sold and derecognized approximately $  945 million   of receivables, collected approximately $  878 million   on behalf of the financial institution, and received funding of approximately   $95 million   by the financial institution, resulting in deferred proceeds of approximately $  23 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  During the same period of   2015  , the Company sold and derecognized approximately   $799 million   of receivables, collected approximately   $614 million   on behalf of the financial institution, and received funding of approximately   $178 million   by the financial institution, resulting in deferred proceeds of approximately   $40 million   as of   September 30, 2015  .  Cash proceeds related to the sales are included in cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the   Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities   line item.  The loss on sale is not material and is included in   Other (Income) Expense, Net   line item on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
    
  The Company has also entered into various factoring and supply chain financing arrangements which also qualify for sale accounting in accordance with the   Transfers and Servicing   topic of the FASB Codification.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company sold receivables of approximately   $33 million   and   $114 million  , respectively, related to these factoring arrangements. 
    
  Receivables sold under all programs subject to continuing involvement, which consist principally of collection services, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were approximately   $347 million   and $  282 million  , respectively.

  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   The amendments in this ASU eliminated the requirement to

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

retrospectively account for provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The adoption did not have any impact on the Company's disclosure for business combinations and financial position. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016 the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-12,   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  .  The amendments in the ASU clarify the proper method of accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.  The adoption had no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This ASU provides guidance to clarify how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted in any annual or interim period.  The updated guidance requires a modified retrospective adoption.  The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Improvements to Employees Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The amendments in this ASU are part of the simplification initiative by the FASB and involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, forfeitures, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted in any annual or interim period.  Depending on the amendment, methods used to apply the requirements of the amendment include modified retrospective, retrospective, and prospective.  The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  The amendments in this ASU require an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance requires a modified retrospective adoption.  The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption on the Company's financial position, results of operation and cash flows.   
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  .  This amendment replaces the current method of measuring inventories at lower of cost or market with a lower of cost and net realizable value method. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  Adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016, and can be applied using a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 3   ACQUISITIONS 
    
  On April 29, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Colorpak, a leading folding carton supplier in Australia and New Zealand.  Colorpak operates three folding carton facilities that convert paperboard into folding cartons for the food, beverage and consumer product markets.  The folding carton facilities are located in Melbourne, Australia, Sydney, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. 
    
  On March 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Metro, a single converting facility located in Wayne, New Jersey.  
    
  On February 16, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of WG Anderson, a premier folding carton manufacturer with a focus on store branded food and consumer product markets.  WG Anderson operates two world-class sheet-fed folding carton converting facilities located in Hamel, Minnesota and Newton, Iowa. 
    
  On January 5, 2016, the Company acquired G-Box. The acquisition includes   two   folding carton converting facilities located in Monterrey, Mexico and Tijuana, Mexico that service the food, beverage, and consumer products markets.  
    
  The Colorpak, Metro, WG Anderson and G-Box transactions are referred to collectively as the "  2016 Acquisitions  " and are included in the Americas Paperboard Packaging Segment. 
    
  The Company paid approximately   $332 million  , net of cash acquired, for the   2016 Acquisitions   using existing cash and borrowings under its revolving line of credit, and assumed debt of approximately   $31 million  .  The acquisition accounting for the   2016 Acquisitions   has been preliminarily allocated to assets and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the purchase dates and is subject to adjustments in subsequent periods once the third party valuations are completed.  Management believes that the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents the benefits expected as the acquisitions were made to continue to grow the food and beverage business, integrate paperboard from the Company's mills and to further optimize the Company's supply chain footprint.  
    
  The Company expects that the goodwill related to Metro will be deductible for tax purposes. The preliminary acquisition accounting allocation for the   2016 Acquisitions   is as follows:

  (Unaudited) 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company and its U.S. and international subsidiaries had the following commitments, amounts outstanding and amounts available under revolving credit facilities: 

(a)   
    In accordance with its debt agreement, the Company s availability under its revolving credit facilities has been reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit issued of   $22.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . These letters of credit are used primarily as security against its self-insurance obligations and workers  compensation obligations. These letters of credit expire at various dates through mid-2018 unless extended. 
       
  The Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the   4.75%   Senior Notes due 2021,   4.875%   Senior Notes due 2022 and   4.125%   Senior Notes due 2024 (the  Indentures ) include covenants which restrict the Company to perform certain activities.

Such restrictions could limit the Company s ability to respond to changing market conditions, fund its capital spending program, provide for unexpected capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities.  
    
  Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company must comply with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company's domestic assets.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement and the Indentures.

Shares issued pursuant to awards under the 2014 Plan are from the Company s authorized but unissued shares.  Compensation costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. 
    
  Stock Awards, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
    
  Under the 2014 Plan, all RSUs generally vest and become payable in   three   years from date of grant.  RSUs granted to employees generally contain either performance conditions based on various financial targets or service requirements that must be met for the shares to vest.  Stock awards granted to non-employee directors as part of their compensation for service on the Board are unrestricted on the grant date. 
  Data concerning RSUs and stock awards granted in the first   nine months   of   2016   is as follows: 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $16.2 million   and   $15.7 million  , respectively, were charged to compensation expense for stock incentive plans.

  The Company maintains both defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care plans that provide medical and life insurance coverage to eligible salaried and hourly retired employees in North America and their dependents. The Company maintains international defined benefit pension plans which are either noncontributory or contributory and are funded in accordance with applicable local laws. Pension or termination benefits are based primarily on years of service and the employee's compensation. 
    
  Pension and Postretirement Expense 
    
  The pension and postretirement expenses related to the Company s plans consisted of the following: 

Employer Contributions 
    
  The Company made contributions of $  39.8 million   and $  42.0 million   to its pension plans during the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company expects to make contributions of   $40 million   to   $60 million   for the full year   2016  .  During   2015  , the Company made $  53.4 million   of contributions to its pension plans. 
    
  The Company made postretirement health care benefit payments of $  0.5 million   and $  1.3 million   during the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company estimates its postretirement health care benefit payments for the full year   2016   to be approximately $  3 million  .  During   2015  , the Company made postretirement health care benefit payments of $  2.8 million  . 

NOTE 7   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
    
  The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments under the   Derivatives and Hedging   topic of the FASB Codification and those not designated as hedging instruments under this guidance. The Company uses interest rate swaps, natural gas swap contracts, and forward exchange contracts. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, to the extent they are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives  fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in   Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income  .  These changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified to earnings. 
    
  For more information regarding the Company s financial instruments and fair value measurement, see    Note 9   Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Hedging Activities  and      Note 10   Fair Value Measurement    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company s   2015   Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks on future interest payments caused by interest rate changes on its variable rate term loan facilities.  Changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified into earnings as a component of   Interest Expense, Net   as interest is incurred on amounts outstanding under the term loan facility.  The following table summarizes the Company's current interest rate swap positions for each period presented as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded in earnings in the period it occurs.  During the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , there were   no   amounts of ineffectiveness related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements. Additionally, there were   no   amounts excluded from the measure of effectiveness. 
    
  Commodity Risk 
    
  To manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows and price risk attributable to certain commodity purchases, the Company enters into natural gas swap contracts to hedge prices for a designated percentage of its expected natural gas usage.  Such contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, the resulting gain or loss reclassified into Cost of Sales concurrently with the recognition of the commodity consumed, and the ineffective portion of the swap contracts  change in fair value recognized immediately in earnings. The Company has hedged approximately   71%   and   29%   of its expected natural gas usage for the remainder of   2016   and   2017  , respectively. 
    
  During the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , there were minimal amounts of ineffectiveness related to changes in the fair value of natural gas swap contracts. Additionally, there were   no   amounts excluded from the measure of effectiveness. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions and future variability of cash flows arising from those transactions that may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. The contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and gains/losses related to these contracts are recognized in   Other (Income) Expense, Net   or   Net Sales  , when appropriate.    
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , multiple forward exchange contracts existed that expire on various dates through the remainder of   2016  . Those purchased forward exchange contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , when aggregated and measured in U.S. dollars at contractual rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , had notional amounts totaling $  13.6 million   and $  65.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  No    amounts were reclassified to earnings during the first   nine months   of   2016   or during   2015   in connection with forecasted transactions that were considered probable of not occurring and there was   no   amount of ineffectiveness related to changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts. Additionally, there were   no   amounts excluded from the measure of effectiveness. 

Derivatives not Designated as Hedges 
    
  The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to effectively hedge substantially all of its accounts receivables resulting from sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to manage risks associated with variability in cash flows that may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , multiple foreign currency forward exchange contracts existed, with maturities ranging up to   three   months. Those foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , when aggregated and measured in U.S. dollars at exchange rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , had net notional amounts totaling $  59.9 million   and $  45.5 million  , respectively. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from these contracts are recognized in   Other (Income) Expense, Net   and approximately offset corresponding recognized but unrealized gains and losses on the remeasurement of these accounts receivable. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company s derivative instruments are carried at fair value. The Company has determined that the inputs to the valuation of these derivative instruments are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 inputs are defined as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for  
  
    15 

     Table of Contents  
  GRAPHIC PACKAGING HOLDING COMPANY 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

substantially the full term of the financial instrument. The Company uses valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analyses, which reflect the terms of the derivatives and use observable market-based inputs, including forward rates, and uses market price quotations obtained from independent derivatives brokers, corroborated with information obtained from independent pricing service providers.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a gross derivative liability of $  5.2 million   and a gross derivative asset of $  1.3 million  , related to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity contracts.   As of   September 30, 2016  , there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of the Company s derivative liabilities due to its own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to the Company s derivative assets based on evaluation of the Company s counterparties  credit risks. 
    
  The fair values of the Company s other financial assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   approximately equal the carrying values reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets except for Long-Term Debt. The fair value of the Company s Long-Term Debt (excluding capital leases and deferred financing fees) was $  2,282.0 million   and $  1,891.2 million   as compared to the carrying amounts of   $2,231.8 million   and $  1,876.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of the Company s Total Debt, including the Senior Notes, are based on quoted market prices (Level 2 inputs). 

The following is a rollforward of pre-tax Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss pertaining to derivative instruments: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects to reclassify approximately $  4 million   of loss in the next twelve months from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to earnings, contemporaneously with and offsetting changes in the related hedged exposure. The actual amount that will be reclassified to future earnings may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. 

NOTE 8   INCOME TAXES    
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of $  71.3 million   on   Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity   of $  262.8 million  . The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is significantly lower than the statutory rate due to an agreement executed with the Internal Revenue Service during the second quarter of 2016.  As a result of this agreement, the Company will amend its 2011 and 2012 U.S. federal and state tax returns and utilize previously expired net operating loss carryforwards.  The Company recorded a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016 of   $22.4 million   to reflect the changes as a reduction in its net long-term deferred tax liability.  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was also different from the statutory rate due to the mix and levels of earnings between foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as well as other discrete items recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of $  102.3 million   on   Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity   of $  274.3 million  .  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was different than the statutory rate primarily due to the mix and levels between foreign and domestic earnings, including losses in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $470 million   of Net Operating Losses ( NOLs ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes which may be used to offset future taxable income.  The Company will utilize NOLs during   2016   and expects to have approximately   $284 million   to   $334 million   of NOLs remaining at   December 31, 2016  .  Based on these NOLs and other tax benefits, the Company does not expect to be a meaningful U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2019. 

NOTE 9   ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  The Company is subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air, soil and water, the management, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, solid waste and hazardous wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from historical site operations and releases of hazardous substances, and the health and safety of employees. Compliance initiatives could result in significant costs, which could negatively impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Any failure to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations or any permits and authorizations required thereunder could subject the Company to fines, corrective action or other sanctions. 
    
  Some of the Company s current and former facilities are the subject of environmental investigations and remediations resulting from historic operations and the release of hazardous substances or other constituents. Some current and former facilities have a history of  
  
    16 

     Table of Contents  
  GRAPHIC PACKAGING HOLDING COMPANY 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

industrial usage for which investigation and remediation obligations may be imposed in the future or for which indemnification claims may be asserted against the Company.  Also, potential future closures or sales of facilities may necessitate further investigation and may result in future remediation at those facilities. 
    
  The Company has established reserves for those facilities or issues where a liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. The Company believes that the amounts accrued for its loss contingencies, and the reasonably possible loss beyond the amounts accrued, are not material to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company cannot estimate with certainty other future corrective compliance, investigation or remediation costs. Some costs relating to historic usage that the Company considers to be reasonably possible of resulting in a liability are not quantifiable at this time. The Company will continue to monitor environmental issues at each of its facilities, as well as regulatory developments, and will revise its accruals, estimates and disclosures relating to past, present and future operations, as additional information is obtained. 
    
  Legal Matters 
    
  The Company is a party to a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary conduct of its business. Although the timing and outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that disposition of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 10   SEGMENT INFORMATION    
    
  During 2015, the Company reevaluated the aggregation of operating segments into reportable segments in accordance with FASB ASC 280   Segment Reporting,   concluded there are   three   reportable segments, and recast prior periods as follows: 
         Paperboard Mills   includes the   seven   North American paperboard mills which produce primarily CUK and CRB. The majority of the paperboard is consumed internally to produce paperboard packaging for the Americas and Europe Paperboard Packaging segments. The remaining paperboard is sold externally to a wide variety of paperboard packaging converters and brokers. The Paperboard Mills segment Net Sales represent the sale of paperboard only to external customers.  The effect of intercompany transfers to the paperboard packaging segments has been eliminated from the Paperboard Mills segment to reflect the economics of the integration of these segments.      
       Americas Paperboard Packaging   includes paperboard packaging folding cartons sold primarily to Consumer Packaged Goods ("CPG") companies serving the food, beverage, and consumer product markets primarily in the Americas. 
    
       Europe Paperboard Packaging   includes paperboard packaging folding cartons sold primarily to CPG companies serving the food, beverage and consumer product markets in Europe. 
        
  The Company allocates certain mill and corporate costs to the reportable segments to appropriately represent the economics of these segments.  The Corporate and Other caption includes the Pacific Rim operating segment and unallocated corporate and one-time costs. 
  These segments are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker based primarily on Income from Operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described above in "  Note 1 - Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation  ."

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS     OF OPERATIONS 

INTRODUCTION 
    
  This management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the Company's past performance, financial condition and prospects. The following will be discussed and analyzed: 

Overview of Business  

Results of Operations  

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Critical Accounting Policies  

New Accounting Standards  

Business Outlook  

OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS 
    
  The Company s objective is to strengthen its position as a leading provider of paperboard packaging solutions. To achieve this objective, the Company offers customers its paperboard, cartons and packaging machines, either as an integrated solution or separately. Cartons and carriers are designed to protect and contain products. Product offerings include a variety of laminated, coated and printed packaging structures that are produced from the Company s coated unbleached kraft ( CUK ) and coated recycled board ( CRB ), as well as other grades of paperboard that are purchased from third party suppliers. Innovative designs and combinations of paperboard, films, foils, metallization, holographics and embossing are customized to the individual needs of the customers. 
    
  The Company is implementing strategies (i) to expand market share in its current markets and to identify and penetrate new markets; (ii) to capitalize on the Company s customer relationships, business competencies, and mills and converting assets; (iii) to develop and market innovative, sustainable products and applications; and (iv) to continue to reduce costs by focusing on operational improvements. The Company s ability to fully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives may be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control, such as inflation of raw material and other costs, which the Company cannot always pass through to its customers, and the effect of overcapacity in the worldwide paperboard packaging industry. 
    
  Significant Factors That Impact The Company s Business    
    
  Impact of Inflation/Deflation.   The Company s cost of sales consists primarily of energy (including natural gas, fuel oil and electricity), pine pulpwood, chemicals, secondary fibers, purchased paperboard, aluminum foil, ink, plastic films and resins, depreciation expense and labor.  Costs   increased   in the first   nine months   of   2016   by $12.3 million, compared to the first   nine months   of   2015  .  The higher costs in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs ($15.4 million) secondary fiber ($5.5 million) and net energy related costs ($4.9 million), partially offset by lower costs for chemicals ($4.7 million), freight ($3.2 million), wood ($2.8 million), corrugate ($2.7 million) and other costs ($0.1 million).  
    
  Because the price of natural gas experiences significant volatility, the Company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows caused by changes in the price of natural gas.  The Company has entered into natural gas swap contracts to hedge prices for a portion of its expected usage for the remainder of   2016   and   2017  .  Since negotiated sales contracts and the market largely determine the pricing for its products, the Company is at times limited in its ability to raise prices and pass through to its customers any inflationary or other cost increases that the Company may incur. 
    
  Commitment to Cost Reduction  . In light of increasing margin pressure throughout the packaging industry, the Company has programs in place that are designed to reduce costs, improve productivity and increase profitability. The Company utilizes a global continuous improvement initiative that uses statistical process control to help design and manage many types of activities, including production and maintenance. This includes a Six Sigma process focused on reducing variable and fixed manufacturing and administrative costs. The Company expanded the continuous improvement initiative to include the deployment of Lean Sigma principles into manufacturing and supply chain services.  
    
  The Company s ability to continue to successfully implement its business strategies and to realize anticipated savings and operating efficiencies is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company s control.  If the Company cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions or other cost savings plans it may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers. In addition, any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the Company s financial results. 
    
  Competition and Market Factors.   As some products can be packaged in different types of materials, the Company s sales are affected by competition from other manufacturers  CUK board and CRB board and other paper substrates such as solid bleached sulfate and recycled clay-coated news. Additional substitute products also include plastic, shrink film and corrugated containers. In addition, while  
  
    27 

     Table of Contents            

the Company has long-term relationships with many of its customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and the Company may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all. The Company works to maintain market share through efficiency, product innovation and strategic sourcing to its customers; however, pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship. 
    
  In addition, the Company s sales historically are driven by consumer buying habits in the markets its customers serve. Changes in consumer dietary habits and preferences, increases in the costs of living, unemployment rates, access to credit markets, as well as other macroeconomic factors, may negatively affect consumer spending behavior. New product introductions and promotional activity by the Company s customers and the Company s introduction of new packaging products also impact its sales.  
    
  Debt Obligations  . The Company had   $2,271.8 million   of outstanding debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . This debt has consequences for the Company, as it requires a portion of cash flow from operations to be used for the payment of principal and interest, exposes the Company to the risk of increased interest rates and restricts the Company s ability to obtain additional financing.  Covenants in the Company's Credit Agreement and Indentures may also restrict, among other things, the disposal of assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees), payment of dividends, loans or advances, and certain other types of transactions. The Credit Agreement also requires compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Company s ability to comply in future periods with the financial covenants will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to many other factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control. See  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity and Capital Resources  for additional information regarding the Company s debt obligations. 
    
  The debt and the restrictions under the Credit Agreement and the Indentures could limit the Company s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures. The outstanding debt obligations and the restrictions may also leave the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business, or unable to carry out capital expenditures that are necessary or important to its growth strategy and productivity improvement programs. 

OVERVIEW OF THIRD QUARTER 2016 RESULTS 
    
  This management s discussion and analysis contains an analysis of   Net Sales  ,   Income from Operations   and other information relevant to an understanding of results of operations. On a Consolidated basis: 

Net Sales   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   increased   by   $33.7 million   or   3.1%   to   $1,103.7 million   from   $1,070.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the acquisitions discussed below, partially offset by the shut down of certain assets during 2015, lower volume in certain consumer products in the Americas, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower pricing. 

Income from Operations   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $4.9 million   or   4.5%   to   $105.1 million   from   $110.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to higher depreciation and amortization related to purchase accounting for the acquisitions, higher inflation and the lower pricing.  These decreases were offset by net improved performance despite operational performance issues related to the onboarding of new or transferred business.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THIRD   QUARTER   2016   COMPARED WITH   THIRD   QUARTER   2015    
    
  Net Sales 

The components of the change in Net Sales are as follows: 

The Company s   Net Sales   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   by   $33.7 million  , or   3.1%   to   $1,103.7 million   from   $1,070.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to Net Sales of $85.3 million for the 2016 Acquisitions as well as the acquisition of Carded Graphics LLC., ( Carded ) on October 1, 2015.  Volumes for beer and soft drinks in the Americas

     Table of Contents            

were up modestly while softness continued for certain consumer products.  Net Sales were also $20.7 million lower due to the closure or shut down of certain assets in the latter part of 2015. Unfavorable exchange rates, primarily the British pound, and lower pricing also negatively impacted Net Sales.  

Income from Operations    

The components of the change in   Income from Operations   are as follows: 

(a)    Includes the Company's cost reduction initiatives, incentive compensation, sales of assets and expenses related to acquisitions and integration activities and shut down costs.  

Income from Operations   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $4.9 million   or   4.5%  , to   $105.1 million   from   $110.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to higher depreciation and amortization related to purchase accounting for the 2016 and Carded Acquisitions, higher inflation, the lower pricing and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.  These decreases were partially offset by cost savings through continuous improvement programs and a reduction in incentive compensation of approximately $10 million.  The quarter was also negatively impacted by operational issues related to the onboarding of new or transferred business related to the closed or announced closure of facilities.  Inflation in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs ($5.1 million), net energy related costs ($4.9 million) and secondary fiber ($3.6 million), partially offset by lower costs for freight ($1.7 million), external board ($1.4 million), wood ($1.2 million), chemicals ($1.2 million) and other costs ($1.0 million).  
    
  Interest Expense, Net    
    
  Interest Expense, Net   was   $20.0 million   and   $16.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Interest Expense, Net   increased   due primarily to higher average debt balances and higher average interest rates as compared to the same period in the prior year.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   37%   of the Company s total debt was subject to floating interest rates. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of $  28.0 million   on   Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity   of $  85.1 million  . The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   is different than the statutory rate primarily due to the mix and levels between foreign and domestic earnings, including losses in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances as well as certain discrete benefits recorded during the quarter.   
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of $  33.6 million   on   Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity   of $  93.5 million  .  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was different than the statutory rate primarily due to the mix and levels of earnings between foreign and domestic earnings, including losses in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $470 million   of Net Operating Losses ( NOLs ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes which may be used to offset future taxable income.  The Company will utilize NOLs during   2016   and expects to have approximately   $284 million   to   $334 million   of NOLs remaining at   December 31, 2016  .  Based on these NOLs and other tax benefits, the Company does not expect to be a meaningful U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2019.

  Net Sales 

The components of the change in Net Sales are as follows: 

The Company s Net Sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   by   $105.6 million  , or   3.4%   to   $3,240.9 million   from   $3,135.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to Net Sales of $201.8 million for the 2016 and Carded Acquisitions, as well as the acquisition of certain assets of Cascades Norampac Division ( Cascades ) on February 4, 2015.  Net Sales were $63.8 million lower due to the shut down of certain assets in the latter part of 2015. Unfavorable exchange rates, primarily the British pound, and lower pricing also negatively impacted Net Sales. Volumes increased for beer and soft drinks in the Americas but were offset by lower volume for certain consumer products in the Americas, primarily cereal, frozen pizza and dry foods. 

Income from Operations 

The components of the change in Income from Operations are as follows: 

(a)    Includes the Company's cost reduction initiatives, incentive compensation, sales of assets and expenses related to acquisitions and integration activities and shut down costs.  

Income from Operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $7.6 million   or   2.3%  , to   $317.9 million   from   $325.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to the lower pricing, the approximate $15 million impact related to the downtime taken to upgrade a paper machine at West Monroe, LA, the higher depreciation and amortization related to purchase accounting for the 2016 and Carded Acquisitions, operational issues related to the onboarding of new or transferred business, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher inflation.  These decreases were partially offset by cost savings through continuous improvement programs and lower incentive compensation.   Inflation in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs ($15.4 million), secondary fiber ($5.5 million) and net energy related costs ($4.9 million), partially offset by lower costs for chemicals ($4.7 million), freight ($3.2 million), wood ($2.8 million), corrugate ($2.7 million) and other costs ($0.1 million).  
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
    
  Interest Expense, Net was   $55.1 million   and   $51.2 million   the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Interest Expense, Net   increased   due primarily to higher average debt balances and higher average interest rates during the same period in the prior year.

Income Tax Expense 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of   $71.3 million   on   Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity   of   $262.8 million  . The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is significantly lower than the statutory rate due to an agreement executed with the Internal Revenue Service.  As a result of this agreement, the Company will amend its 2011 and 2012 U.S. federal and state tax returns and utilize previously expired net operating loss carryforwards.  The Company recorded a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016 of $22.4 million to reflect the changes as a reduction in its net long-term deferred tax liability.  The effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was also different from the statutory rate due to the mix and levels of earnings between foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as well as other discrete items recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of   $102.3 million   on   Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity   of   $274.3 million  .  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was different than the statutory rate primarily due to the mix and levels of earnings between foreign and domestic earnings, including losses in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances.  
    
  Segment Reporting 
    
  During 2015, the Company reevaluated the aggregation of operating segments into reportable segments in accordance with FASB ASC 280   Segment Reporting,   concluded there are three reportable segments, and recast prior periods as follows: 
      
       Paperboard Mills   includes the seven North American paperboard mills which produce primarily CUK and CRB. The majority of the paperboard is consumed internally to produce paperboard packaging for the Americas and Europe Paperboard Packaging segments. The remaining paperboard is sold externally to a wide variety of paperboard packaging converters and brokers. The Paperboard Mills segment Net Sales represent the sale of paperboard only to external customers. The effect of intercompany transfers to the paperboard packaging segments has been eliminated from the Paperboard Mills segment to reflect the economics of the integration of these segments.      
       Americas Paperboard Packaging   includes paperboard packaging folding cartons sold primarily to Consumer Packaged Goods ("CPG") companies serving the food, beverage, and consumer product markets primarily in the Americas. 
    
       Europe Paperboard Packaging   includes paperboard packaging folding cartons sold primarily to CPG companies serving the food, beverage and consumer product markets in Europe. 
        
  The Company allocates certain mill and corporate costs to the reportable segments to appropriately represent the economics of these segments.  The Corporate and Other caption includes the Pacific Rim operating segment and unallocated corporate and one-time costs. 
  These segments are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker based primarily on Income from Operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described above in Note 1 - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

2016   COMPARED WITH   2015    

Third Quarter 2016 Compared to Third Quarter 2015  
  Paperboard Mills 
  Net Sales   decreased   due primarily to the third quarter 2015 shut down of the Jonquiere, Quebec mill (part of the February 4, 2015 Cascades acquisition) and the October 2015 shut down of the kraft paper machine in West Monroe, LA. as well as lower open market sales across all substrates. 
  Income from Operations   decreased   due to inflation partially offset by productivity improvements. 
  Americas Paperboard Packaging

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The Company broadly defines liquidity as its ability to generate sufficient funds from both internal and external sources to meet its obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate debt and equity financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financial objectives. Therefore, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving long-range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments. 
    
  Cash Flows   

Net cash provided by operating activities for the first   nine months   of   2016   totaled   $394.3 million  , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $351.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was due primarily to the 2016 Acquisitions and lower inventory balances, excluding the impact of the 2016 Acquisitions.  Pension contributions for the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015   were   $39.8 million   and   $42.0 million  , respectively. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the first   nine months   of   2016   totaled   $594.4 million  , compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $294.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .   Current year activities consisted primarily of capital spending of   $258.4 million   and   $331.9 million   for the 2016 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired.  In the prior year, the Company paid $113.6 million, net of cash acquired, for the Cascades and Rose City acquisitions and had   $181.7 million   of capital spending.  
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the first   nine months   of   2016   totaled   $190.1 million  , compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $52.6 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Current year activities include net borrowings under revolving credit facilities of   $80.0 million  , primarily for the 2016 Acquisitions, and payments on debt of   $18.8 million  .  In addition, the Company completed its debt offering of $300 million aggregated principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2024 in a registered public offering and used the net proceeds to repay a portion of its outstanding borrowings of its senior secured revolving credit facility.  The Company also paid dividends of   $48.5 million  , repurchased   $106.4 million   of its common stock, and withheld   $10.6 million   of restricted stock units to satisfy tax withholding payments related to the payout of restricted stock units.  In the prior year, the Company had net borrowings under revolving credit facilities of   $44.4 million   primarily for the Rose City and Carded acquisitions and made payments of debt of   $18.7 million  .  Additionally, the Company paid dividends of   $32.9 million  , repurchased   $23.0 million   of its common stock and withheld   $21.3 million   of restricted stock units to satisfy tax withholding payments related to the payout of restricted stock units. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company's liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on its indebtedness and from the funding of its capital expenditures, ongoing operating costs and working capital. Principal and interest payments under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facilities, together with principal and interest payments on the Company's   4.75%   Senior Notes due 2021,   4.875%   Senior Notes due 2022 and   4.125%   Senior Notes due 2024 (the  Notes ), represent liquidity requirements for the Company. Based upon current levels of operations, anticipated cost savings and expectations as to future growth, the Company believes that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under its revolving credit facilities and other available financing sources, will be adequate to permit the Company to meet its debt service obligations, necessary capital expenditure program requirements and ongoing operating costs and working capital needs, although no assurance can be given in this regard. The Company's future financial and operating performance, ability to service or refinance its debt and ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its debt agreements (see  Covenant Restrictions  below) will be subject to future economic conditions, including conditions in the credit markets, and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and will be substantially dependent on the selling prices and demand for the Company's products, raw material and energy costs, and the Company's ability to successfully implement its overall business and profitability strategies. 

The Company has entered into agreements for the purchasing and servicing of receivables to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to a third party financial institution.  Transfers under these agreements meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with the   Transfers and Servicing   topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (the "Codification").  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , the Company sold and derecognized approximately $  945 million   of receivables, collected approximately $  878 million   on behalf of the financial institution, and received funding of approximately   $95 million   by the financial institution, resulting in deferred proceeds of approximately $  23 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  During the same period of   2015  , the Company sold and derecognized approximately   $799 million   of receivables, collected approximately   $614 million   on behalf of the financial institution, and received funding of approximately   $178 million   by the financial institution, resulting in deferred proceeds of approximately   $40 million   as of   September 30, 2015  .  Cash proceeds related to the sales are included in cash from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities line item.  The loss on sale is not material and is included in   Other (Income) Expense, Net   line item on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

     Table of Contents            

The Company has also entered into various factoring and supply chain financing arrangements which also qualify for sale accounting in accordance with the   Transfers and Servicing   topic of the FASB Codification.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company sold receivables of approximately   $33 million   and   $114 million  , respectively, related to these factoring arrangements. 
    
  Receivables sold under all programs subject to continuing involvement, which consist principally of collection services, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were approximately   $347 million   and $  282 million  , respectively.  

Covenant Restrictions 
    
  Covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and the Indentures may, among other things, limit the ability to incur additional indebtedness restrict the ability of the Company to dispose of assets, incur guarantee obligations, prepay other indebtedness, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, create liens, make equity or debt investments, make acquisitions, modify terms of the indentures under which the Notes are issued, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. Such restrictions, together with disruptions in the credit markets, could limit the Company's ability to respond to changing market conditions, fund its capital spending program, provide for unexpected capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. 
    
  Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company must comply with a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio covenant and a minimum Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio covenant.  The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which contains the definitions of these covenants, was filed as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K filed on October 7, 2014.   
    
  The Company must maintain a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of less than 4.25 to 1.00.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio covenant in the Credit Agreement and the ratio was 2.74 to 1.00. 
    
  The Company must also comply with a minimum Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio of 3.00 to 1.00.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the minimum Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio covenant in the Credit Agreement and the ratio was 12.08 to 1.00. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's credit was BB+ by Standard   Poor's and Ba1 by Moody's Investor Services.  Standard   Poor's and Moody's Investor Services' ratings on the Company included a stable outlook.  

Capital Investment 
    
  The Company s capital investment in the first   nine months   of   2016   was   $258.4 million   compared to   $181.7 million   in the first   nine months   of   2015  . The capital investments were primarily due to planned asset upgrades at the U.S.-based mills and continued investments made as part of the integration of acquisitions. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  Some of the Company s current and former facilities are the subject of environmental investigations and remediations resulting from historical operations and the release of hazardous substances or other constituents. Some current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which investigation and remediation obligations may be imposed in the future or for which indemnification claims may be asserted against the Company. Also, potential future closures or sales of facilities may necessitate further investigation and may result in future remediation at those facilities. The Company has established reserves for those facilities or issues where liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. 
    
  For further discussion of the Company s environmental matters, see Note 9 in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. 
    
  The Company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment or involve complex estimations are described in GPHC s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .
