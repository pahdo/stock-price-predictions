NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1.    Organization and Presentation 

HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA"), incorporated under the laws of Maryland, is a New York State based bank holding company and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group"). The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of HSBC USA and its subsidiaries (collectively "HUSI") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, as well as in accordance with predominant practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been made. HUSI may also be referred to in these notes to the consolidated financial statements as "we", "us" or "our". These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Form 10-K"). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our income tax expense reflects an immaterial out of period adjustment to reverse a tax benefit of approximately   $7 million   recorded in the second quarter of 2016 relating to a non-deductible expense. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Interim results should not be considered indicative of results in future periods.

2.    Trading Assets and Liabilities                 

Trading assets and liabilities consisted of the following: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of derivatives included in trading assets is net of   $4,463 million   and   $4,652 million  , respectively, relating to amounts recognized for the obligation to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and     December 31, 2015  , the fair value of derivatives included in trading liabilities is net of   $1,305 million   and   $1,530 million  , respectively, relating to amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral paid under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. 
  See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments," for further information on our trading derivatives and related collateral.

3.    Securities 

Our securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity portfolios consisted of the following: 

11 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(2)   
    Foreign debt securities represent public sector entity, bank or corporate debt. 
      Net unrealized gains   increased   within the available-for-sale portfolio in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to decreasing yields on U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities. 

12 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The following table summarizes gross unrealized losses and related fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   classified as to the length of time the losses have existed: 

Although the fair value of a particular security is below its amortized cost, it does not necessarily result in a credit loss and hence an other-than-temporary impairment. The decline in fair value may be caused by, among other things, the illiquidity of the market. We have reviewed the securities for which there is an unrealized loss for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with our accounting policies, discussed further below. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we do not consider any of our debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as we expect to recover their amortized cost basis and we neither intend nor expect  
  
   13 

HSBC USA Inc. 

to be required to sell these securities prior to recovery, even if that equates to holding securities until their individual maturities. However, other-than-temporary impairments may occur in future periods if the credit quality of the securities deteriorates. 
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment    On a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with an unrealized loss has suffered other-than-temporary impairment. A debt security is considered impaired if its fair value is less than its amortized cost at the reporting date. If impaired, we assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. 
  If we intend to sell the debt security or if it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and the unrealized loss is recorded in earnings. An impairment is also considered other-than-temporary if a credit loss exists (i.e., the present value of the expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security). In the event a credit loss exists, the credit loss component of an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded in earnings while the remaining portion of the impairment loss attributable to factors other than credit loss is recognized, net of tax, in other comprehensive income (loss).  
  For all securities held in the available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolios for which unrealized losses attributed to factors other than credit existed, we do not have the intention to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the securities for contractual, regulatory or liquidity reasons as of the reporting date. For a complete description of the factors considered when analyzing debt securities for impairments, see Note 4, "Securities," in our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our process for assessing impairment during 2016. 
  During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015,   none   of our debt securities were determined to have either initial other-than-temporary impairment or changes to previous other-than-temporary impairment estimates relating to the credit component, as such, there were   no   other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized related to credit loss.  
  Certain asset-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio have an embedded financial guarantee provided by monoline insurers. Because the financial guarantee is not a separate and distinct contract from the asset-backed security, they are considered a single unit of account for fair value measurement and impairment assessment purposes. In evaluating the degree of reliance to be placed on the financial guarantee of a monoline insurer when estimating the cash flows to be collected for the purpose of recognizing and measuring impairment loss, consideration is given to our assessment of the creditworthiness of the monoline and other market factors. Based on the information available, including any actions undertaken by the regulatory agencies over the monoline insurers and their published financial results, we perform both a credit as well as a liquidity analysis on the monoline insurers each quarter. Our analysis also includes a review of market-based credit default spreads, when available, to assess the appropriateness of our assessment of the monoline insurer s creditworthiness. A credit downgrade to non-investment grade is key but not the only factor in determining the monoline insurer s ability to fulfill its contractual obligation under the financial guarantee. Although a monoline may have been downgraded by the credit rating agencies or ordered to commute its operations by the insurance commissioners, it may retain the ability and the obligation to continue to pay claims in the near term. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we held   12   individual asset-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, of which   5   were also wrapped by a monoline insurance company. The asset-backed securities backed by a monoline wrap comprised   $159 million   of the total aggregate fair value of asset-backed securities of   $563 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The gross unrealized losses on these monoline wrapped securities were   $32 million   at   September 30, 2016  . We did not take into consideration the value of the monoline wrap of any non-investment grade monoline insurers at   September 30, 2016   and, therefore, we only considered the financial guarantee of investment grade monoline insurers for purposes of evaluating other-than-temporary impairment on securities with a fair value of   $65 million  . 
  At   December 31, 2015  , we held   12   individual asset-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, of which   5   were also wrapped by a monoline insurance company. The asset-backed securities backed by a monoline wrap comprised   $164 million   of the total aggregate fair value of asset-backed securities of   $173 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The gross unrealized losses on these monoline wrapped securities were   $29 million   at   December 31, 2015  . We did not take into consideration the value of the monoline wrap of any non-investment grade monoline insurers at   December 31, 2015   and, therefore, we only considered the financial guarantee of investment grade monoline insurers for purposes of evaluating other-than-temporary impairment on securities with a fair value of   $75 million  .

Other securities gains (losses), net    The following table summarizes realized gains and losses on investment securities transactions attributable to available-for-sale securities: 

Contractual Maturities and Yields   The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair values of securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity at   September 30, 2016   by contractual maturity. Expected maturities differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties in certain cases. Securities available-for-sale amounts exclude equity securities as they do not have stated maturities. The table below also reflects the distribution of maturities of debt securities held at   September 30, 2016  , together with the approximate taxable equivalent yield of the portfolio. The yields shown are calculated by dividing annualized interest income, including the accretion of discounts and the amortization of premiums, by the amortized cost of securities outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a taxable equivalent basis using applicable statutory tax rates. 

Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock of   $383 million   and   $632 million  , respectively, were included in other assets at   September 30, 2016  . Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock of   $323 million   and   $632 million  , respectively, were included in other assets at   December 31, 2015  .

4.    Loans  

Loans consisted of the following:  

(1)   
    Represents large multinational firms including globally focused U.S. corporate and financial institutions and U.S. dollar lending to multinational banking customers managed by HSBC on a global basis. Also includes loans to HSBC affiliates which totaled   $4,463 million   and   $4,815 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," for additional information regarding loans to HSBC affiliates. 
     Net deferred origination fees totaled   $54 million   and   $62 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a net unamortized premium on our loans of   $2 million   and   $16 million  , respectively.

Aging Analysis of Past Due Loans    The following table summarizes the past due status of our loans, excluding loans held for sale, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The aging of past due amounts is determined based on the contractual delinquency status of payments under the loan. An account is generally considered to be contractually delinquent when payments have not been made in accordance with the loan terms. Delinquency status is affected by customer account management policies and practices such as re-age, which results in the re-setting of the contractual delinquency status to current. 

(1)      
    Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.  
               (2)   
    The decrease in past due loans at   September 30, 2016   reflects the impact of transfers of certain residential mortgage loans to held for sale during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . See Note 6, "Loans Held for Sale" for additional details. 
     
   17 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Nonaccrual Loans    Nonaccrual loans, including nonaccrual loans held for sale, and accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent consisted of the following: 

(1)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans held for investment include   $318 million   and   $768 million  , respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. 
               (2)   
    Nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent.  
               (3)   
    Nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans are predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our consumer loan portfolio. 
               (4)   
    The trend in nonaccrual loans reflects the impact of transfers of certain residential mortgage loans to held for sale during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
     The following table provides additional information on our nonaccrual loans:

Impaired Loans    A loan is considered to be impaired when it is deemed probable that not all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will be collected. Probable losses from impaired loans are quantified and recorded as a component of the overall allowance for credit losses. Commercial and consumer loans for which we have modified the loan terms as part of a troubled debt restructuring are considered to be impaired loans. Additionally, commercial loans in nonaccrual status, or that have been partially charged-off or assigned a specific allowance for credit losses are also considered impaired loans. 
  Troubled debt restructurings    TDR Loans represent loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide for terms that are less than what we would be willing to accept for new loans with comparable risk because of deterioration in the borrower s financial condition. 
  Modifications for consumer or commercial loans may include changes to one or more terms of the loan, including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, extension of the amortization period, reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal, accrued interest or other loan covenants. A substantial amount of our modifications involve interest rate reductions which lower the amount of interest income we are contractually entitled to receive in future periods. Through lowering the interest rate and other loan term changes, we believe we are able to increase the amount of cash flow that will ultimately be collected from the loan, given the borrower s financial condition. TDR Loans are reserved for either based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans  original effective interest rates which generally results in a higher reserve requirement for these loans or in the case of certain secured loans, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. Once a consumer loan is classified as a TDR Loan, it continues to be reported as such until it is paid off or charged-off. For commercial loans, if subsequent performance is in accordance with the new terms and such terms reflect current market rates at the time of restructure, they will no longer be reported as a TDR Loan beginning in the year after restructuring. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   there were   no   commercial loans that met this criteria and were removed from TDR Loan classification. 
  The following table presents information about loans which were modified during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and as a result of this action became classified as TDR Loans: 

The weighted-average contractual rate reduction for consumer loans which became classified as TDR Loans during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   1.41 percent   and   1.61 percent  , respectively, compared with   1.62 percent   and   1.76 percent   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The weighted-average contractual rate reduction for commercial loans was not significant in either the number of loans or rate.

The following table presents information about our TDR Loans and the related allowance for credit losses for TDR Loans: 

(1)   
    TDR Loans are considered to be impaired loans. For consumer loans, all such loans are considered impaired loans regardless of accrual status. For commercial loans, impaired loans include other loans in addition to TDR Loans which totaled   $614 million   and   $88 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
               (2)   
    The carrying value of TDR Loans includes basis adjustments on the loans, such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, partial charge-offs and premiums or discounts on purchased loans.  
                (4)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of consumer mortgage TDR Loans held for investment includes   $662 million   and   $881 million  , respectively, of loans that are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell.  
               (5)   
    The decrease in TDR Loans at   September 30, 2016   reflects the impact of transfers of certain residential mortgage loans to held for sale during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . There is   no   allowance for credit losses associated with loans classified as held for sale as they are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value less cost to sell.

Commercial Loan Credit Quality Indicators    The following credit quality indicators are monitored for our commercial loan portfolio: 
  Criticized loans    Criticized loan classifications presented in the table below are determined by the assignment of various criticized facility grades based on the risk rating standards of our regulator. The following facility grades are deemed to be criticized: 
             
    Special Mention     generally includes loans that are protected by collateral and/or the credit worthiness of the customer, but are potentially weak based upon economic or market circumstances which, if not checked or corrected, could weaken our credit position at some future date.  
                
    Substandard     includes loans that are inadequately protected by the underlying collateral and/or general credit worthiness of the customer. These loans present a distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
                
    Doubtful     includes loans that have all the weaknesses exhibited by substandard loans, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full of the recorded loan highly improbable. However, although the possibility of loss is extremely high, certain factors exist which may strengthen the credit at some future date, and therefore the decision to charge off the loan is deferred. Loans graded as doubtful are required to be placed in nonaccruing status. 
     The following table summarizes criticized commercial loans: 

The increase in criticized commercial loans at September 30, 2016 was driven by downgrades, predominantly emerging markets related. 
  Nonperforming    The following table summarizes the status of our commercial loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale:

    Investment grade includes commercial loans with credit ratings of at least BBB- or above or the equivalent based on our internal credit rating system. 
     Consumer Loan Credit Quality Indicators    The following credit quality indicators are utilized for our consumer loan portfolio: 
  Delinquency    The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and as a percent of total loans and loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio") for our consumer loan portfolio: 

(1)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes   $699 million   and   $793 million  , respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, including   $391 million   and   $3 million  , respectively, relating to loans held for sale.

    The decrease in nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016   reflects the impact of transfers of certain residential mortgage loans to held for sale during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
     Troubled debt restructurings    See discussion of impaired loans above for further details on this credit quality indicator. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our loan portfolios included interest-only residential mortgage loans totaling   $3,623 million   and   $3,645 million  , respectively. An interest-only residential mortgage loan allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period. However, subsequent events affecting a customer's financial position could affect the ability of customers to repay the loan in the future when the principal payments are required which increases the credit risk of this loan type.

5.    Allowance for Credit Losses 

The following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses by product and the related loan balance by product during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

HSBC USA Inc. 

(1)   
    The provision for credit losses and charge-offs for residential mortgage loans during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes   $11 million   related to the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for loans transferred to held for sale. See Note 6, "Loans Held for Sale," for additional information. 
               (2)   
    For collateral dependent loans that are transferred to held for sale, the existing allowance for credit losses at the time of transfer are recognized as a charge-off. We transferred to held for sale certain residential mortgage loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and, accordingly, we recognized the existing allowance for credit losses on these loans as additional charge-off totaling   $20 million   and   $22 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
                (4)   
    For consumer loans and certain small business loans, these amounts represent TDR Loans for which we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each loan is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. Loans individually evaluated for impairment exclude TDR loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell which totaled   $662 million   and   $858 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

6.    Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale consisted of the following: 

Commercial Loans      During the second quarter of 2016, we sold   $1,161 million   of commercial real estate loans to a third party and recognized a loss on sale of approximately   $3 million  , including transaction costs. Upon completion of the sale, the remaining loans that were not sold, which had a carrying value of   $612 million   at June 30, 2016, were transferred back to held for investment as we now intend to hold these loans for the foreseeable future. 
  Global banking loans held for sale includes commercial loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as commercial loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans, which we have elected to designate under the fair value option, totaled   $649 million   and   $151 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See Note 11, "Fair Value Option," for additional information.  
  Global banking loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and transferred to held for sale which totaled   $92 million   and   $49 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We recorded lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments associated with the write-down of commercial loans held for sale of   $7 million   and   $37 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $2 million   and   $16 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income. The   $7 million   lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflects an immaterial out of period adjustment related to certain commercial real estate loans which were transferred back to held for investment in the second quarter of 2016 as discussed above. 
  Consumer Loans    As previously disclosed, we continue to evaluate our overall operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies, as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, as well as continued market demand for non-performing residential mortgage loans, during the first quarter of 2016 we decided we no longer have the intent to hold for investment certain residential mortgage loans and adopted a formal program to initiate sale activities for these residential mortgage loans when a loan meeting pre-determined criteria is written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell (generally 180 days past due) in accordance with our existing charge-off policies. These loans were largely originated by us prior to the implementation of our Premier strategy.  
  Under this program, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we transferred residential mortgage loans to held for sale with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $25 million   and   $549 million  , respectively, at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these loans prior to transfer, after considering the fair value of the property less costs to sell, was approximately   $23 million   and   $456 million  , respectively, including related escrow advances. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of   $4 million   and   $42 million  , respectively, associated with newly transferred loans, all of which was attributed to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $2 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on these loans held for sale as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income as a result of a change in the estimated pricing on specific pools of loans. As we plan to sell these loans to third party investors, fair value represents the price we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the loan portfolios. 
  
   28 

HSBC USA Inc. 

In addition to the residential mortgage sales program discussed above, during the third quarter of 2016, we decided we no longer have the intent to hold for investment a portfolio of residential mortgage loans that we previously purchased from HSBC Finance Corporation ("HSBC Finance"), along with any home equity mortgage balances associated with these loans. As a result of this decision, during the third quarter of 2016, we transferred residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans to held for sale with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $648 million   at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these loans prior to transfer, after considering the fair value of the property less costs to sell, as applicable, was approximately   $628 million  , including accrued interest. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an initial lower of cost or fair value adjustment of   $11 million   associated with the newly transferred loans, all of which was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. As we plan to sell these loans to third party investors, fair value represents the price we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the loans.  
  We also continue to sell all our agency eligible residential mortgage loan originations servicing released directly to PHH Mortgage Corporation ("PHH Mortgage"). Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of residential mortgage banking revenue (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Residential mortgage loans held for sale also includes subprime residential mortgage loans with a fair value of   $3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   which were previously acquired from unaffiliated third parties and from HSBC Finance with the intent of securitizing or selling the loans to third parties.  
  Loans held for sale are subject to market risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk, in that their value will fluctuate as a result of changes in market conditions, as well as the credit environment. PHH Mortgage is obligated to purchase agency eligible loans from us as of the earlier of when the customer locks the mortgage loan pricing or when the mortgage loan application is approved. As such, we retain none of the risk of market changes in mortgage rates for these loans purchased by PHH Mortgage.  
  Other consumer loans held for sale reflects student loans which we no longer originate.  
  Valuation Allowances    Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was   $60 million   and   $13 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was   $54 million   and   $21 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

7.    Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consisted of the following: 

Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSRs")    A servicing asset is a contract under which estimated future revenues from contractually specified cash flows, such as servicing fees and other ancillary revenues, are expected to exceed the obligation to service the financial assets. Prior to our agreement with PHH Mortgage, we recognized the right to service residential mortgage loans as a separate and distinct asset at the time they were acquired or when originated loans were sold. 
  In March 2016, we initiated an active program to sell our remaining MSRs portfolio and reclassified them to held for sale within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 9, "Other Assets Held for Sale," for additional information on our MSRs portfolio at   September 30, 2016   and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  The following table summarizes the critical assumptions used to calculate the fair value of MSRs at   December 31, 2015  : 

29 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The following table summarizes MSRs activity during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  : 

The outstanding principal balance of serviced for others mortgages, which are not included in the consolidated balance sheet, totaled   $18,930 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Servicing fees collected are included in residential mortgage banking revenue (expense) and totaled     $13 million   and   $43 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  PHH Mortgage provides us with mortgage origination processing services as well as the sub-servicing of our portfolio of owned and serviced for others mortgages with an outstanding principal balance of   $35,164 million   and   $37,544 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Although we continue to own both the mortgages on our balance sheet and the mortgage servicing rights associated with the serviced loans at the time of conversion, we sell our agency eligible originations to PHH Mortgage on a servicing released basis which results in no new mortgage servicing rights being recognized.  
  Purchased credit card relationships    In 2012, we purchased from HSBC Finance the account relationships associated with   $746 million   of credit card receivables which were not included in the sale to Capital One Financial Corporation at a fair value of   $108 million  . Approximately   $43 million   of this value was associated with the credit card receivables sold to First Niagara Bank, National Association and was written off at the time of sale. The remaining   $65 million   was included in intangible assets and is being amortized over the estimated useful life of the credit card relationships which is   ten years  . 

8.    Goodwill 

Goodwill was   $1,612 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Included in goodwill for these periods were accumulated impairment losses of   $670 million  .  
  During the third quarter of 2016, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts. 

9.    Other Assets Held for Sale 

In March 2016, our Retail Banking and Wealth Management business initiated an active program to sell its remaining MSRs portfolio which has been in run-off for several years. As a result, we now consider the MSRs portfolio and related servicing advances to be held for sale at September 30, 2016 and reported them in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the remaining MSRs portfolio to a third party and expect the sale to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. As the MSRs continue to be carried at fair value and we expect to transfer the related servicing advances to the buyer at near cost, the resulting gain or loss on sale, including transaction costs, is not expected to be significant. 
  The disposal group held for sale reported in other assets consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016  :

MSRs are subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risk, in that their value will fluctuate as a result of changes in these economic variables. Interest rate risk is mitigated through an economic hedging program that uses securities and derivatives to offset changes in the fair value of MSRs. Since the hedging program involves trading activity, risk is quantified and managed using a number of risk assessment techniques. 
  
   30 

HSBC USA Inc. 

MSRs are initially measured at fair value at the time that the related loans are sold and remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. Changes in fair value of MSRs are reflected in residential mortgage banking revenue (expense) in the period in which the changes occur. At September 30, 2016, fair value is determined based upon the sales price formula as defined in the executed sales agreement. Previously, fair value was determined based upon the application of valuation models and other inputs. The valuation models incorporated assumptions market participants would use in estimating future cash flows. The reasonableness of these valuation models was periodically validated by reference to external independent broker valuations and industry surveys. 
  The following table summarizes MSRs activity during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

The outstanding principal balance of serviced for others mortgages, which are not included in the consolidated balance sheet, totaled   $16,476 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Servicing fees collected are included in residential mortgage banking revenue (expense) and totaled     $11 million   and   $36 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

10.    Derivative Financial Instruments 

In the normal course of business, the derivative instruments entered into are for trading, market making and risk management purposes. For financial reporting purposes, derivative instruments are designated in one of the following categories: (a) financial instruments held for trading, (b) hedging instruments designated as qualifying hedges under derivative and hedge accounting principles or (c) non-qualifying economic hedges. The derivative instruments held are predominantly swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. All derivatives are stated at fair value. Where we enter into enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties, the master netting agreements permit us to net those derivative asset and liability positions and to offset cash collateral held and posted with the same counterparty. 
  The following table presents the fair value of derivative contracts by major product type on a gross basis. Gross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting as well as collateral, and therefore are not representative of our exposure. The table below presents the amounts of counterparty netting and cash collateral that have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet, as well as cash and securities collateral posted and received under enforceable master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria for netting. Derivative assets and liabilities which are not subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, or are subject to a netting agreement where an appropriate legal opinion to determine such agreements are enforceable has not been either sought or obtained, have not been netted in the table below. Where we have received or posted collateral under netting agreements where an appropriate legal opinion to determine such agreements are enforceable has not been either sought or obtained, the related collateral also has not been netted in the table below.    
  
   31 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(1)   
    Derivative assets / liabilities related to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and derivative instruments held for purposes other than for trading are recorded in other assets / interest, taxes and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
               (2)   
    Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives include derivatives executed and settled bilaterally with counterparties without the use of an organized exchange or central clearing house. The credit risk associated with bilateral OTC derivatives is managed through master netting agreements and obtaining collateral. OTC-cleared derivatives are executed bilaterally in the OTC market but then novated to a central clearing counterparty, whereby the central clearing counterparty becomes the counterparty to both of the original counterparties. Exchange traded derivatives are executed directly on an organized exchange that provides pre-trade price transparency. Credit risk is minimized for OTC-cleared derivatives and exchange traded derivatives through daily margining required by central clearing counterparties. 
               (3)   
    Trading related derivative assets/liabilities are recorded in trading assets / trading liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
               (4)   
    Represents the netting of derivative receivable and payable balances for the same counterparty under enforceable netting agreements.

HSBC USA Inc. 

(5)   
    Represents the netting of cash collateral posted and received by counterparty under enforceable netting agreements. 
               (6)   
    Netting is performed at a counterparty level in cases where enforceable master netting agreements are in place, regardless of the type of derivative instrument. Therefore, we have not attempted to allocate netting to the different types of derivative instruments shown in the table above. 
     See Note 18, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," for further information on offsetting related to resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending arrangements. 
  Derivatives Held for Risk Management Purposes    Our risk management policy requires us to identify, analyze and manage risks arising from the activities conducted during the normal course of business. We use derivative instruments as an asset and liability management tool to manage our exposures in interest rate, foreign currency and credit risks in existing assets and liabilities, commitments and forecasted transactions. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument will depend on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. 
  We designate derivative instruments to offset the fair value risk and cash flow risk arising from fixed-rate and floating-rate assets and liabilities as well as forecasted transactions. We assess the hedging relationships, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, using a regression approach to determine whether the designated hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or the cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Accounting principles for qualifying hedges require us to prepare detailed documentation describing the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, including, but not limited to, the risk management objective, the hedging strategy and the methods to assess and measure the ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship. We discontinue hedge accounting when we determine that the hedge is no longer highly effective, the hedging instrument is terminated, sold or expired, the designated forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring, or when the designation is removed by us. 
  Fair Value Hedges    In the normal course of business, we hold fixed-rate loans and securities and issue fixed-rate senior and subordinated debt obligations. The fair value of fixed-rate (U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar denominated) assets and liabilities fluctuates in response to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize interest rate swaps, forward and futures contracts and foreign currency swaps to minimize the effect on earnings caused by interest rate and foreign currency volatility. The changes in the fair value of the hedged item designated in a qualifying hedge are captured as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item (basis adjustment). If the hedging relationship is terminated and the hedged item continues to exist, the basis adjustment is amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item.  
  We recorded basis adjustments for active fair value hedges which decreased the carrying amount of our debt by   $26 million   and increased by   $70 million     during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with increases of   $25 million   and   $13 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. We amortized   $2 million   and   $5 million   of basis adjustments related to terminated and/or re-designated fair value hedge relationships of our debt during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $2 million   and   $5 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The total accumulated unamortized basis adjustments amounted to an increase in the carrying amount of our debt of   $59 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with a decrease of   $6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Basis adjustments for active fair value hedges of available-for-sale ("AFS") securities decreased the carrying amount of the securities by   $93 million   and   increased   by   $861 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with increases of   $412 million   and   $234 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The total accumulated unamortized basis adjustments for active fair value hedges of AFS securities amounted to increases in the carrying amount of the securities of   $1,278 million   and   $439 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

The following table presents information on gains and losses on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedging instruments in fair value hedges and the hedged items in fair value hedges and their location on the consolidated statement of income: 

Cash Flow Hedges    We own or issue floating rate financial instruments and enter into forecasted transactions that give rise to variability in future cash flows. As a part of our risk management strategy, we use interest rate swaps, currency swaps and futures contracts to mitigate risk associated with variability in the cash flows. Changes in fair value of a derivative instrument associated with the effective portion of a qualifying cash flow hedge are recognized initially in other comprehensive income (loss). When the cash flows being hedged materialize and are recorded in income or expense, the associated gain or loss from the hedging derivative previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") is reclassified into earnings in the same accounting period in which the designated forecasted transaction or hedged item affects earnings. If a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is de-designated because it is no longer highly effective, or if the hedge relationship is terminated, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging derivative to that date will continue to be reported in AOCI unless it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period as documented at the inception of the hedge, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is released into earnings. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , active cash flow hedge relationships extend or mature through   July 2036  . During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   $5 million   and   $14 million   of losses related to terminated and/or re-designated cash flow hedge relationships were amortized to earnings from AOCI, compared with losses of   $3 million   and   $8 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. During the next twelve months, we expect to amortize   $13 million   of remaining losses to earnings resulting from these terminated and/or re-designated cash flow hedges. The interest accrual related to the hedging instruments is recognized in interest income.

Trading Derivatives and Non-Qualifying Hedging Activities    In addition to risk management, we enter into derivative instruments, including buy- and sell-protection credit derivatives, for trading and market making purposes, to repackage risks and structure trades to facilitate clients  needs for various risk taking and risk modification purposes. We manage our risk exposure by entering into offsetting derivatives with other financial institutions to mitigate the market risks, in part or in full, arising from our trading activities with our clients. In addition, we also enter into buy-protection credit derivatives with other market participants to manage our counterparty credit risk exposure. Where we enter into derivatives for trading purposes, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in trading revenue or residential mortgage banking revenue (expense). Credit losses arising from counterparty risk on over-the-counter derivative instruments and offsetting buy protection credit derivative positions are recognized as an adjustment to the fair value of the derivatives and are recorded in trading revenue. 
  Our non-qualifying hedging activities include: 
             
    Derivative contracts related to the fixed-rate long-term debt issuances and hybrid instruments, including all structured notes and structured deposits, for which we have elected fair value option accounting. These derivative contracts are non-qualifying hedges but are considered economic hedges.  
                
    Credit default swaps which are designated as economic hedges against the credit risks within our loan portfolio. In the event of an impairment loss occurring in a loan that is economically hedged, the impairment loss is recognized as provision for credit losses while the gain on the credit default swap is recorded as other income.  
                
    Forward purchase or sale of to-be-announced ("TBA") securities designated to economically hedge mortgage servicing rights. Changes in the fair value of TBA positions, which are considered derivatives, are recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue (expense).  
     Derivative instruments designated as economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value through profit and loss. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on economic hedges are recognized in gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives, other income (loss) or residential mortgage banking revenue (expense) while the derivative asset or liability positions are reflected as other assets or other liabilities.

Credit-Risk Related Contingent Features    We enter into total return swap, interest rate swap, cross-currency swap and credit default swap contracts, amongst others, which contain provisions that require us to maintain a specific credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. Sometimes the derivative instrument transactions are a part of broader structured product transactions. If HSBC Bank USA, National Association's ("HSBC Bank USA") credit ratings were to fall below the current ratings, the counterparties to our derivative instruments could demand us to post additional collateral. The amount of additional collateral required to be posted will depend on whether HSBC Bank USA is downgraded by one or more notches. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a liability position at   September 30, 2016   was   $7,949 million  , for which we had posted collateral of   $7,575 million  . The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position at   December 31, 2015   was   $7,139 million  , for which we had posted collateral of   $6,283 million  . Substantially all of the collateral posted is in the form of cash or securities available-for-sale. See Note 18, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," for further details.

The following tables summarize our obligation to post additional collateral (from the current collateral level) in certain hypothetical commercially reasonable downgrade scenarios of our long term ratings. It is not appropriate to accumulate or extrapolate information presented in the tables below to determine our total obligation because the information presented to determine the obligation in hypothetical rating scenarios is not mutually exclusive.

11.    Fair Value Option 

We report our results to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"), which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and as endorsed by the European Union ("EU"). We typically have elected to apply fair value option ("FVO") accounting to selected financial instruments to align the measurement attributes of those instruments under U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis and to simplify the accounting model applied to those financial instruments. We elected to apply FVO accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities sold under repurchase agreements, certain fixed-rate long-term debt issuances and hybrid instruments which include all structured notes and structured deposits. Changes in fair value for these assets and liabilities are reported as gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives in the consolidated statement of income. 
  Loans    We elected to apply FVO accounting to certain commercial syndicated loans which are originated with the intent to sell and certain commercial loans that we purchased from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps and include these loans as loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. The election allows us to account for these loans at fair value which is consistent with the manner in which the instruments are managed. Where available, fair value is based on observable market consensus pricing obtained from independent sources, relevant broker quotes or observed market prices of instruments with similar characteristics. Where observable market parameters are not available, fair value is determined based on contractual cash flows adjusted for estimates of prepayment rates, expected default rates and loss severity discounted at management's estimate of the expected rate of return required by market participants. We also consider loan specific risk mitigating factors such as collateral arrangements in determining the fair value estimate. Interest from these loans is recorded as interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Because a substantial majority of the loans elected for the fair value option are floating rate assets, changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in loan-specific credit risk factors. The components of gain (loss) related to loans designated at fair value are summarized in the table below. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   loans for which the fair value option has been elected were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status. 
  Resale and Repurchase Agreements    We elected to apply FVO accounting to certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements which are trading in nature. The election allows us to account for these resale and repurchase agreements at fair value which is consistent with the manner in which the instruments are managed. The fair value of the resale and repurchase agreements is determined using market rates currently offered on comparable transactions with similar underlying collateral and maturities. Interest on these resale and repurchase agreements is recorded as interest income or expense in the consolidated statement of income. The components of gain (loss) related to these resale and repurchase agreements designated at fair value are summarized in the table below. 
  Long-Term Debt (Own Debt Issuances)    We elected to apply FVO accounting for certain fixed-rate long-term debt for which we had applied or otherwise would elect to apply fair value hedge accounting. The election allows us to achieve a similar accounting effect without having to meet the hedge accounting requirements. The own debt issuances elected under FVO are traded in secondary markets and, as such, the fair value is determined based on observed prices for the specific instruments. The observed market price of these instruments reflects the effect of changes to our own credit spreads and interest rates. Interest on the fixed-rate debt accounted for under FVO is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. The components of gain (loss) related to long-term debt designated at fair value are summarized in the table below. 
  Hybrid Instruments    We elected to apply FVO accounting to all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and structured deposits. The valuation of the hybrid instruments is predominantly driven by the derivative features embedded within the instruments and own credit risk. Cash flows of the hybrid instruments in their entirety, including the embedded derivatives, are discounted at an appropriate rate for the applicable duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit spreads. The credit spreads applied to structured notes are determined with reference to our own debt issuance rates observed in the primary and secondary markets, internal funding rates, and structured note rates in recent executions while the credit spreads applied to structured deposits are determined using market rates currently offered on comparable deposits with similar characteristics and maturities. Interest on this debt is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. The components of gain (loss) related to hybrid instruments designated at fair value which reflect the instruments described above are summarized in the table below.

The following table summarizes the fair value and unpaid principal balance for items we account for under FVO: 

Components of Gain (Loss) on Instruments at Fair Value and Related Derivatives    Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives includes the changes in fair value related to interest, credit and other risks as well as the mark-to-market adjustment on the related derivatives and the net realized gains or losses on these derivatives. The following table summarizes the components of gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives related to the changes in fair value of the financial instrument accounted for under FVO: 
  
   39 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(1)   
    As it relates to hybrid instruments, interest rate and other components includes interest rate, foreign exchange and equity contract risks. 
               (2)   
    During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, the gains in the credit risk component for long-term debt were attributable to the widening of our own credit spreads. 
               (3)   
    During   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , the loss in the credit risk component for hybrid instruments was attributable primarily to the tightening of our own credit spreads related to structured notes. During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the loss in the credit risk component for hybrid  
     
   40 

HSBC USA Inc. 

instruments was attributable to the tightening of credit spreads on structured deposits, partially offset by the widening of our own credits spreads related to structured notes. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the gains in the credit risk component for hybrid instruments were attributable primarily to the widening of credit spreads on structured deposits and, in the three month period, the widening of our own credit spreads related to structured notes. These gains were partially offset in the year-to-date period by a loss due to changes in estimates associated with the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of certain structured notes and deposits.

13.    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Defined Benefit Pension Plan    The components of pension expense for the defined benefit pension plan recorded in our consolidated statement of income and shown in the table below reflect the portion of pension expense of the combined HSBC North America Pension Plan (either the "HSBC North America Pension Plan" or the "Plan") which has been allocated to us. 

During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , pension expense was impacted by an immaterial out of period adjustment which increased pension expense by   $6 million   in order to properly reflect changes in participant census data which should have been included in pension valuations in prior periods.

Postretirement Plans Other Than Pensions    The components of net periodic benefit cost for our postretirement plans other than pension are as follows: 

14.    Related Party Transactions  

In the normal course of business, we conduct transactions with HSBC and its subsidiaries. HSBC policy requires that these transactions occur at prevailing market rates and terms and include funding arrangements, derivative transactions, servicing arrangements, information technology support, centralized support services, banking and other miscellaneous services and where applicable, these transactions are compliant with United States banking regulations. All extensions of credit by (and certain credit exposures of) HSBC Bank USA to other HSBC affiliates (other than Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insured banks) are legally required to be secured by eligible collateral. The following tables and discussions below present the more significant related party balances and the income (expense) generated by related party transactions:

    Trading assets and trading liabilities do not reflect the impact of netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met. Trading assets and liabilities primarily consist of derivatives contracts. 
               (3)   
    Other assets and other liabilities primarily consist of derivative balances associated with hedging activities and other miscellaneous account receivables and payables.

Employees also may participate in a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement plans sponsored by HSBC North America which are discussed in Note 13, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits." 
     Funding Arrangements with HSBC Affiliates: 
  We use HSBC affiliates to fund a portion of our borrowing and liquidity needs.     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , long-term debt with affiliates reflected   $5.9 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively, of floating rate borrowings from HSBC North America. The outstanding balances include: 
      We have a   $150 million   uncommitted line of credit with HSBC North America Inc. although there was no outstanding balance at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  We have also incurred short-term borrowings with certain affiliates, largely securities sold under repurchase agreements with HSI. In addition, certain affiliates have also placed deposits with us.

Lending and Derivative Related Arrangements Extended to HSBC Affiliates: 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have the following loan balances outstanding with HSBC affiliates: 

(1)   
    An asset-backed commercial paper conduit consolidated by an HSBC affiliate. 
     HSBC Finance Corporation    We have extended a   $5.0 billion  ,   364  -day uncommitted unsecured revolving credit agreement to HSBC Finance which expires during the fourth quarter of 2017. The credit agreement allows for borrowings with maturities of up to   5 years  .     At both   September 30, 2016     and   December 31, 2015  ,   $3.0 billion   was outstanding under this credit agreement with   $0.5 billion   maturing in   September 2017  ,   $1.5 billion   maturing in   January 2018   and   $1.0 billion   maturing in   September 2018  . At December 31, 2015, we also had extended a committed revolving credit facility to HSBC Finance of   $1.0 billion   which did not have any outstanding balance. During the third quarter of 2016, this credit facility was terminated. 
  HMUS and subsidiaries    We have extended loans and lines, some of them uncommitted, to HMUS and its subsidiaries in the amount of   $8.9 billion   and   $10.7 billion   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,     of which   $473 million   and   $978 million  , respectively, was outstanding. The maturities of the outstanding balances range from overnight to three months. Each borrowing is re-evaluated prior to its maturity date and either extended or allowed to mature.

We have extended an uncommitted line of credit to HSBC Mexico S.A. in the amount of   $1.2 billion   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , of which   $975 million   and   $725 million   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.     The outstanding balances mature at various stages between 2017 and 2018. 
  Regency    During the third quarter of 2016, Regency was restructured and the liquidity facilities we previously provided to them were terminated. See Note 17, "Variable Interest Entities," for additional discussion. Prior to the third quarter of 2016, HUSI was committed to provide liquidity facilities to backstop the liquidity risk in Regency in relation to assets originated in the United States. The notional amount of the liquidity facilities provided by HUSI to Regency was approximately   $3.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015   which was less than half of Regency's total liquidity facilities. At   December 31, 2015  ,   $58 million   was outstanding under these facilities. 
  We have extended lines of credit to various other HSBC affiliates totaling   $3.1 billion   which did not have any outstanding balances at either   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Other short-term affiliate lending    In addition to loans and lines extended to affiliates discussed above, from time to time we may extend loans to affiliates which are generally short term in nature. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $2 million   and   $40 million  , respectively, of these loans outstanding. 
  As part of a global HSBC strategy to offset interest rate or other market risks associated with certain securities, debt issues and derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties, we routinely enter into derivative transactions with HSBC Finance, HSBC Bank plc and other HSBC affiliates. The notional value of derivative contracts related to these transactions was approximately   $979.1 billion   and   $1,004.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The net credit exposure (defined as the net fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, including any collateral received) related to the contracts was approximately   $6 million   and   $216 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our Global Banking and Markets business accounts for these transactions on a mark to market basis, with the change in value of contracts with HSBC affiliates substantially offset by the change in value of related contracts entered into with unaffiliated third parties.

Services Provided Between HSBC Affiliates: 
  Under multiple service level agreements, we provide services to and receive services from various HSBC affiliates. The following summarizes these activities: 
             
    Servicing activities for residential mortgage loans across North America are performed both by us and HSBC Finance. As a result, we receive servicing fees from HSBC Finance for services performed on their behalf and pay servicing fees to HSBC Finance for services performed on our behalf. The fees we receive from HSBC Finance are reported in servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates. Fees we pay to HSBC Finance are reported in support services from HSBC affiliates. This includes fees paid for the servicing of residential mortgage loans (with a carrying amount of   $586 million   and   $696 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively) that we purchased from HSBC Finance in 2003 and 2004. During the third quarter of 2016, we transferred these residential mortgage loans to held for sale. See Note 7, "Loans Held for Sale," for additional information. 
                
    HSBC North America's technology and certain centralized support services including human resources, corporate affairs, risk management, legal, compliance, tax, finance and other shared services that are centralized within HTSU. HTSU also provides certain item processing and statement processing activities to us. The fees we pay HTSU for the centralized support services and processing activities are included in support services from HSBC affiliates. We also receive fees from HTSU for providing certain administrative services to them. The fees we receive from HTSU are included in servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates. In certain cases, for facilities used by HTSU, we may guarantee their performance under the lease agreements. 
                
    We use HSBC Global Services Limited, an HSBC affiliate located outside of the United States, to provide various support services to our operations including among other areas, customer service, systems, collection and accounting functions. The expenses related to these services are included in support services from HSBC affiliates. 
                
    We utilize HSI, a subsidiary of HMUS, for broker dealer, debt underwriting, customer referrals, loan syndication and other treasury and traded markets related services, pursuant to service level agreements. Debt underwriting fees charged by HSI are deferred as a reduction of long-term debt and amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt. Fees charged by HSI for the other services are included in support services from HSBC affiliates. 
                
    We receive fees from other subsidiaries of HSBC, including HSBC Bank plc and HSI, for providing them with banking and other miscellaneous services as well as support for certain administrative and global business activities. These fees are reported in servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates. 
     Other Transactions with HSBC Affiliates 
  We received revenue from our affiliates for rent on certain office space, which has been recorded as a component of support services from HSBC affiliates. Rental revenue from our affiliates totaled     $16 million   and   $47 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $15 million   and   $44 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  During the second quarter of 2016, HSBC USA issued   $1,265 million   of   6.0 percent   Non-Cumulative Series I Preferred Stock to HSBC North America. See Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," for additional details. 

15.    Business Segments  

We have   four   distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global businesses and business strategy: Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GB M") and Private Banking ("PB").  
  We previously announced that with effect from January 1, 2016, a portion of our Business Banking client group, generally representing those small business customers with   $3 million   or less in annual revenue (now referred to as Retail Business Banking), would be better managed as part of RBWM rather than CMB given the similarities in their banking activities with the RBWM customer base. Therefore, to coincide with the change in our management reporting effective beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we have included the results of Retail Business Banking in the RBWM segment for all periods presented. As a result, loss before tax for the RBWM segment increased   $9 million   and   $25 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively  .   There have been no other changes in the basis of our segmentation or measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  During the first half of 2016, we determined that a portion of our Large Corporate client group, generally representing those large business customers with more complex banking activities which require the levels of support routinely provided by relationship managers in GB M, would be better managed as part of GB M rather than CMB, effective October 1, 2016. Therefore, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we will include the results of the transferred client relationships in the GB M segment for all periods presented. We currently expect this transfer will result in an increase to loans and deposits for the GB M segment of approximately  
  
   46 

HSBC USA Inc. 

$3.4 billion   and   $2.4 billion  , respectively. The profit before tax associated with these relationships was approximately   $83 million   and   $54 million   during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
  Our segment results are presented in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. However, we continue to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis.  
  We continue to review the financial information used to manage our businesses, including the scope and content of the financial data, including the U.S. GAAP financial data, being reported to our Management and our Board. To the extent we make changes to this reporting in the future, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting. 
  A summary of differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are presented in Note 22, "Business Segments," in our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2015 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis. 
  The following table summarizes the results for each segment on a Group Reporting Basis, as well as provides a reconciliation of total results under the Group Reporting Basis to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals: 

47 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(1)   
    Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities of the segment adjusted for a funding charge or credit. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk from the segments to one centralized unit in Balance Sheet Management and more appropriately reflect the profitability of segments. 
               (2)   
    Expenses for the segments include fully apportioned corporate overhead expenses. 
               (3)   
    Represents adjustments associated with differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis.  
               (4)   
    Represents differences in financial statement presentation between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis. 

16.    Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements 

Bank dividends are one of the sources of funds used for payment of shareholder dividends and other HSBC USA cash needs. Any non-contractual dividend from HSBC Bank USA would require the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("the OCC"). Approval is also required if the total of all dividends HSBC Bank USA declares in any year exceeds the cumulative net profits for that year, combined with the profits for the two preceding years reduced by dividends attributable to those years. Under a separate restriction, payment of dividends is prohibited in amounts greater than undivided profits then on hand, after deducting actual losses and bad debts. Bad debts are debts due and unpaid for a period of six months unless well secured, as defined, and in the process of collection. 
  
   48 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The following table summarizes the capital amounts and ratios of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA, calculated in accordance with banking regulations in effect at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA are categorized as "well-capitalized," as defined by their principal regulators. To be categorized as well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines, a banking institution must have the ratios reflected in the above table, and must not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. 
               (2)   
    There are no common equity Tier 1 or Tier 1 leverage ratio components in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. The ratios shown are the regulatory minimum ratios. 
     In 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S. ("the Basel III final rule") which, for banking organizations such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, took effect in 2014 with certain provisions being phased in over time through the beginning of 2019. As a result, the capital ratios in the table above are reported in accordance with the Basel III transition rules within the final rule. In addition, risk weighted assets in the table above are calculated using the Basel III Standardized Approach. 
  As previously reported, as a result of the adoption of the final rules by the U.S. banking regulators implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee, together with the impact of similar implementation by United Kingdom banking regulators, we continue to review the composition of our capital structure. During the second quarter of 2016, HSBC USA redeemed all of its remaining externally issued preferred stock, including its Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series F Preferred Stock, Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series G Preferred Stock and   6.50 percent   Non-Cumulative Series H Preferred Stock, at their stated values of   $25   per share,   $1,000   per share and   $1,000   per share, respectively, resulting in a total cash payment of   $1,265 million  . In connection with these redemptions, HSBC USA issued   1,265   shares of   6.0 percent   Non-Cumulative Series I Preferred Stock to HSBC North America in exchange for cash consideration of   $1,265 million  . Dividends on the   6.0 percent   Non-Cumulative Series I Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and will be payable when and if declared by our Board of Directors semi-annually on the first business day of June and December of each year at the stated rate of   6.0 percent  . The Series I Preferred Stock may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, on or after May 31, 2021 or at any time after we receive notice from the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") that the Series I Preferred Stock may no longer be included in the calculation of regulatory capital as a result of any subsequent changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations, at a redemption price equal to   $1,000,000   per share, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, but only after receipt of written approval from the FRB.

17.    Variable Interest Entities 

In the ordinary course of business, we have organized special purpose entities ("SPEs") primarily to structure financial products to meet our clients' investment needs, to facilitate clients to access and raise financing from capital markets and to securitize financial assets held to meet our own funding needs. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate SPEs based on the purpose, risk characteristics and business activities of the SPEs. An SPE is a VIE if it lacks sufficient equity investment at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack either a) the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance; or b) the obligation to absorb the entity's expected losses, the right to receive the expected residual returns, or both.   
  Variable Interest Entities    We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a controlling financial interest as evidenced by the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and therefore are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We take into account our entire involvement in a VIE (explicit or implicit) in identifying variable interests that individually or in the aggregate could be significant enough to warrant our designation as the primary beneficiary and hence require us to consolidate the VIE or otherwise require us to make appropriate disclosures. We consider our involvement to be potentially significant where we, among other things, (i) provide liquidity put options or other liquidity facilities to support the VIE's debt obligations; (ii) enter into derivative contracts to absorb the risks and benefits from the VIE or from the assets held by the VIE; (iii) provide a financial guarantee that covers assets held or liabilities issued by a VIE; (iv) sponsor the VIE in that we design, organize and structure the transaction; and (v) retain a financial or servicing interest in the VIE. 
  We are required to evaluate whether to consolidate a VIE when we first become involved and on an ongoing basis. In almost all cases, a qualitative analysis of our involvement in the entity provides sufficient evidence to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. In rare cases, a more detailed analysis to quantify the extent of variability to be absorbed by each variable interest holder is required to determine the primary beneficiary.  
  Consolidated VIEs    The following table summarizes assets and liabilities related to our consolidated VIEs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   which are consolidated on our balance sheet. Assets and liabilities exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. 

Low income housing limited liability partnership      In 2009, all low income housing investments held by us at the time were transferred to a Limited Liability Partnership ("LLP") in exchange for debt and equity while a third party invested cash for an equity interest that is mandatorily redeemable at a future date. The LLP was created in order to ensure the utilization of future tax benefits from these low income housing tax projects. The LLP was deemed to be a VIE as it does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to finance its activities. Upon entering into this transaction, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the LLP due to the nature of our continuing involvement and, as a result, consolidate the LLP and report the equity interest issued to the third party investor in other liabilities and the assets of the LLP in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. The investments held by the LLP represent equity investments in the underlying low income housing partnerships. The LLP does not consolidate the underlying partnerships because it does not have the power to direct the activities of the partnerships that most significantly impact the economic performance of the partnerships.  
  As a practical expedient, we amortize our low income housing investments in proportion to the allocated tax benefits under the proportional amortization method and present the associated tax benefits net of investment amortization in income tax expense. 
  
   50 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Unconsolidated VIEs    We also have variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary. The following table provides additional information on these unconsolidated VIEs, including the variable interests held by us and our maximum exposure to loss arising from our involvements in these VIEs, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

(1)   
    During 2016, we revised the above table to include a refinancing SPE which was an unconsolidated VIE at December 31, 2015 as discussed further below. This revision did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.  
     Information on the types of variable interest entities with which we are involved, the nature of our involvement and the variable interests held in those entities is presented below. 
  Asset-backed commercial paper ("ABCP") conduit      Prior to the third quarter of 2016, we provided liquidity facilities to Regency, a multi-seller ABCP conduit consolidated by an HSBC affiliate. Customers sold financial assets, such as trade receivables, to Regency, which funded the purchases by issuing short-term highly-rated commercial paper collateralized by the assets acquired. We, along with other financial institutions, provided liquidity facilities to Regency in the form of lines of credit or asset purchase commitments. These liquidity facilities supported transactions associated with a specific seller of assets to the conduit and we were only required to provide support in the event of certain triggers associated with those transactions and assets. Our obligations were generally pari passu with those of other institutions that also provided liquidity support to the same conduit or for the same transactions. We did not provide any program-wide credit enhancements to Regency. Each seller of assets to an ABCP conduit typically provides credit enhancements in the form of asset overcollateralization and, therefore, bears the risk of first loss related to the specific assets transferred. We did not transfer our own assets to Regency. We also did not provide the majority of the liquidity facilities to Regency. We had no ownership interests in, performed no administrative duties for, and did not service any of the assets held by Regency. We were not the primary beneficiary and did not consolidate Regency. Credit risk related to the liquidity facilities provided was managed by subjecting these facilities to our normal underwriting and risk management processes. The   $3,362 million   maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2015 presented in the table above represented the maximum amount of loans and asset purchases we could have been required to fund under the liquidity facilities. The maximum loss exposure was estimated assuming the facilities were fully drawn and the underlying collateralized assets were in default with zero recovery value. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, Regency was restructured and these liquidity facilities were terminated. In lieu of providing the liquidity facilities, we entered into risk participation agreements with Regency under which we purchased the specific underlying third party customer receivables from Regency and committed to provide funding to the specific third party customers on an ongoing basis as they draw or repay. Following the restructure, Regency will no longer issue commercial paper against these specific receivables as they will be fully-funded from our balance sheet. As a result of terminating the liquidity facilities and entering into the risk participation agreements, we no longer have a variable interest in Regency and we reported   $2,224 million   and   $1,566 million   of third party loans and unfunded commitments, respectively, at September 30, 2016. 
  Structured note vehicles      We provide derivatives, such as interest rate and currency swaps, to structured note vehicles and, in certain instances, invest in the vehicles' debt instruments. We hold variable interests in these structured note vehicles in the form of total return swaps under which we take on the risks and benefits of the structured notes they issue. The same risks and benefits are passed on to third party entities through back-end total return swaps. We earn a spread for facilitating the transaction. Since  
  
   51 

HSBC USA Inc. 

we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE and are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate them. Our maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of the derivatives wrapping the structured notes. The maximum exposure to loss will occur in the unlikely scenario where the value of the structured notes is reduced to zero and, at the same time, the counterparty of the back-end swap defaults with zero recovery. In certain instances, we hold credit default swaps with the structured note vehicles under which we receive credit protection on specified reference assets in exchange for the payment of a premium. Through these derivatives, the vehicles assume the credit risk associated with the reference assets which are then passed on to the holders of the debt instruments they issue. Because they create rather than absorb variability, the credit default swaps we hold are not considered variable interests. We record all investments in, and derivative contracts with, unconsolidated structured note vehicles at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. 
  Limited partnership investments    We invest as a limited partner in partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing, renewable energy and community development projects. The returns of these investments are generated primarily from the tax benefits, including federal tax credits and tax deductions from operating losses in the project companies. In addition, some of the investments also help us comply with the Community Reinvestment Act. Certain limited partnership structures are considered to be VIEs because either (a) they do not have sufficient equity investment at risk or (b) the limited partners with equity at risk do not have substantive kick-out rights through voting rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner. As a limited partner, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and do not consolidate them. Our investments in these partnerships are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure to loss shown in the table above represents our recorded investments. 
  Refinancing SPE    We organized and provided loans to a SPE to purchase a senior secured financing facility from the originator designed to finance a third party borrower's acquisition of a portfolio of commercial real estate loans in Mexico. Interest and principal repayments of the prepayable financing facility are dependent on and are secured by the rental cash flows generated from the underlying commercial real estate properties. The financing facility contains additional credit enhancements, including a 15 percent equity subordination in the borrower's capital structure and a financial guarantee over 25 percent of the outstanding balance provided by the borrower's parent. 
  The SPE is a refinancing vehicle designed to secure term financing from external investors to repay our loans. The loans issued to the SPE are supported by the financing facility and the security interests in the commercial real estate loans and the credit enhancements. The refinancing vehicle is a VIE because it does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance the activities without additional subordination provided by any parties. We have a variable interest in the VIE through our ownership of the loans. In view of the purpose and design of the SPE, the overall funding structure, the additional credit enhancements and the risks inherent in the VIE, we concluded the investors absorb an insignificant amount of expected loss and/or benefit in the VIE. Rather, the borrower and its parent take on the risks and benefits in the VIE through the credit enhancements provided to the holder of the financing facility. In addition, the investors do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and, therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The maximum exposure to loss shown in the table above represents our investment in the loans without consideration of any recovery benefits from the credit enhancements. 
  Third-party sponsored securitization entities      We invest in asset-backed securities issued by third party sponsored securitization entities which may be considered VIEs. The investments are transacted at arm's-length and decisions to invest are based on a credit analysis of the underlying collateral assets or the issuer. We are a passive investor in these issuers and do not have the power to direct the activities of these issuers. As such, we do not consolidate these securitization entities. Additionally, we do not have other involvements in servicing or managing the collateral assets or provide financial or liquidity support to these issuers which potentially give rise to risk of loss exposure. These investments are an integral part of the disclosure in Note 2, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," Note 3, "Securities," and Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," and, therefore, are not disclosed in this note to avoid redundancy.  

18.    Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements 

Guarantee Arrangements    As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet guarantee arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and include standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions. The contractual amounts of these arrangements represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that we are required to fulfill the maximum obligation under the contractual terms of the guarantee. 
  
   52 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The following table presents total carrying value and contractual amounts of our sell protection credit derivatives and major off-balance sheet guarantee arrangements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Following the table is a description of the various arrangements.  

(3)   
    For standby letters of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements, maximum loss represents losses to be recognized assuming the letter of credit and liquidity facilities have been fully drawn and the obligors have defaulted with zero recovery. 
               (4)   
    For credit derivatives, the maximum loss is represented by the notional amounts without consideration of mitigating effects from collateral or recourse arrangements. 
     Credit-Risk Related Guarantees 
  Credit derivatives      Credit derivatives are financial instruments that transfer the credit risk of a reference obligation from the credit protection buyer to the credit protection seller who is exposed to the credit risk without buying the reference obligation. We sell credit protection on underlying reference obligations (such as loans or securities) by entering into credit derivatives, primarily in the form of credit default swaps, with various institutions. We account for all credit derivatives at fair value. Where we sell credit protection to a counterparty that holds the reference obligation, the arrangement is effectively a financial guarantee on the reference obligation. Under a credit derivative contract, the credit protection seller will reimburse the credit protection buyer upon occurrence of a credit event (such as bankruptcy, insolvency, restructuring or failure to meet payment obligations when due) as defined in the derivative contract, in return for a periodic premium. Upon occurrence of a credit event, we will pay the counterparty the stated notional amount of the derivative contract and receive the underlying reference obligation. The recovery value of the reference obligation received could be significantly lower than its notional principal amount when a credit event occurs.  
  Certain derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements and related collateral agreements. A party to a derivative contract may demand that the counterparty post additional collateral in the event its net exposure exceeds certain predetermined limits and when the credit rating falls below a certain grade. We set the collateral requirements by counterparty such that the collateral covers various transactions and products, and is not allocated to specific individual contracts.  
  We manage our exposure to credit derivatives using a variety of risk mitigation strategies where we enter into offsetting hedge positions or transfer the economic risks, in part or in entirety, to investors through the issuance of structured credit products. We actively manage the credit and market risk exposure in the credit derivative portfolios on a net basis and, as such, retain no or a limited net sell protection position at any time. The following table summarizes our net credit derivative positions at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    Positions are presented net in the table above to provide a complete analysis of our risk exposure and depict the way we manage our credit derivative portfolio. The offset of the sell-protection credit derivatives against the buy-protection credit derivatives may not be legally binding in the absence of master netting agreements with the same counterparty. Furthermore, the credit loss triggering events for individual sell protection credit derivatives may not be the same or occur in the same period as those of the buy protection credit derivatives thereby not providing an exact offset.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Standby letters of credit      A standby letter of credit is issued to a third party for the benefit of a customer and is a guarantee that the customer will perform or satisfy certain obligations under a contract. It irrevocably obligates us to pay a specified amount to the third party beneficiary if the customer fails to perform the contractual obligation. We issue two types of standby letters of credit: performance and financial. A performance standby letter of credit is issued where the customer is required to perform some non-financial contractual obligation, such as the performance of a specific act, whereas a financial standby letter of credit is issued where the customer's contractual obligation is of a financial nature, such as the repayment of a loan or debt instrument. At   September 30, 2016  , the total amount of outstanding financial standby letters of credit (net of participations) and performance guarantees (net of participations) were   $5,539 million   and   $2,887 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2015  , the total amount of outstanding financial standby letters of credit (net of participations) and performance guarantees (net of participations) were   $5,842 million   and   $3,008 million  , respectively.  
  The issuance of a standby letter of credit is subject to our credit approval process and collateral requirements. We charge fees for issuing letters of credit commensurate with the customer's credit evaluation and the nature of any collateral. Included in other liabilities are deferred fees on standby letters of credit amounting to   $49 million   and   $54 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Also included in other liabilities is an allowance for credit losses on unfunded standby letters of credit of   $38 million   and   $19 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The following table summarizes the credit ratings related to guarantees including the ratings of counterparties against which we sold credit protection and financial standby letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   as an indicative proxy of payment risk:

    The credit ratings in the table represent external credit ratings for classification as investment grade and non-investment grade. 
               (2)   
    External ratings for most of the obligors are not available. Presented above are the internal credit ratings which are developed using similar methodologies and rating scale equivalent to external credit ratings for purposes of classification as investment grade and non-investment grade. 
     Our internal credit ratings are determined based on HSBC's risk rating systems and processes which assign a credit grade based on a scale which ranks the risk of default of a customer. The credit grades are assigned and used for managing risk and determining level of credit exposure appetite based on the customer's operating performance, liquidity, capital structure and debt service ability. In addition, we also incorporate subjective judgments into the risk rating process concerning such things as industry trends, comparison of performance to industry peers and perceived quality of management. We compare our internal risk ratings to outside external rating agency benchmarks, where possible, at the time of formal review and regularly monitor whether our risk ratings are comparable to the external ratings benchmark data.  
  A non-investment grade rating of a referenced obligor has a negative impact to the fair value of the credit derivative and increases the likelihood that we will be required to perform under the credit derivative contract. We employ market-based parameters and, where possible, use the observable credit spreads of the referenced obligors as measurement inputs in determining the fair value of the credit derivatives. We believe that such market parameters are more indicative of the current status of payment/performance risk than external ratings by the rating agencies which may not be forward-looking in nature and, as a result, lag behind those market-based indicators.  
  Non Credit-Risk Related Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
  Liquidity asset purchase agreements      Prior to the third quarter of 2016, we provided liquidity facilities to Regency, a multi-seller ABCP conduit consolidated by an HSBC affiliate. Regency financed the purchase of individual assets by issuing commercial paper to third party investors. Each liquidity facility was transaction specific and had a maximum limit. Pursuant to the liquidity agreements, we were obligated, subject to certain limitations, to advance funds in an amount not to exceed the face value of the commercial paper in the event Regency was unable or unwilling to refinance its commercial paper. A liquidity asset purchase

agreement is economically a conditional written put option issued to the conduit where the exercise price is the face value of the commercial paper. At   December 31, 2015   we had issued   $3,362 million   of liquidity facilities to provide liquidity support to Regency. During the third quarter of 2016, Regency was restructured and these liquidity facilities were terminated. See Note 17, "Variable Interest Entities," for further discussion. 
  Clearinghouses and exchanges      We are a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivatives contracts. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, members of a clearinghouse may be required to contribute to a guaranty fund to backstop members' obligations to the clearinghouse. As a member, we may be required to pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member who defaults on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. Our guarantee obligations would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had exhausted its resources. Any potential contingent liability under these membership agreements cannot be estimated. 
  Securitization Activity      In addition to the repurchase risk described above, we have also been involved as a sponsor/seller of loans used to facilitate whole loan securitizations underwritten by our affiliate, HSI. In this regard, we began acquiring residential mortgage loans in 2005 which were warehoused on our balance sheet with the intent of selling them to HSI to facilitate HSI s whole loan securitization program which was discontinued in 2007. During 2005-2007, we purchased and sold   $24 billion   of such loans to HSI which were subsequently securitized and sold by HSI to third parties. See "  Mortgage Securitization Matters  " in Note 27, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 20, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our Form 10-Q for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 for additional discussion of related exposure. There have been no significant changes with regards to this exposure since March 31, 2016. The outstanding principal balance on these loans was approximately   $4.8 billion   and   $5.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Mortgage Loan Repurchase Obligations      Historically, we originated and sold mortgage loans, primarily to government sponsored entities, and provided various representations and warranties related to, among other things, the ownership of the loans, the validity of the liens, the loan selection and origination process, and the compliance to the origination criteria established by the agencies. In the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be obligated to repurchase the loans with identified defects or to indemnify the buyers. Our contractual obligation arises only when the breach of representations and warranties are discovered and repurchase is demanded. As a result of settlements with FNMA and FHLMC during 2013 and 2014, the repurchase exposure associated with these sales has been substantially resolved. In addition, with the conversion of our mortgage processing and servicing operations to PHH Mortgage in 2013, new agency eligible originations are sold directly to PHH Mortgage and PHH Mortgage is responsible for origination representations and warranties for all loans purchased. 
  In estimating our repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider historical losses on residual risks not covered by settlement agreements adjusted for any risk factors not captured in the historical losses as well as the level of outstanding repurchase demands received. Outstanding repurchase demands received totaled   $9 million   and   $5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes the change in our estimated repurchase liability during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   for obligations arising from the breach of representations and warranties associated with mortgage loans sold: 

Our remaining repurchase liability of   $12 million   at   September 30, 2016   represents our best estimate of the loss that has been incurred, including interest, arising from breaches of representations and warranties associated with mortgage loans sold. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses is dependent upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external risk factors such as housing market trends that may change, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses requires significant judgment. We continue to evaluate our methods of determining the best estimate of loss based on recent trends. As these estimates are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates making it reasonably possible that they could change. The range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our recorded repurchase liability is between   zero   and   $25 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This estimated range of reasonably possible losses was determined based upon modifying the assumptions utilized in our best estimate of probable losses to reflect what we believe to be reasonably possible adverse assumptions.

Pledged Assets 
  Pledged assets included in the consolidated balance sheet consisted of the following: 

(1)   
    Trading assets are primarily pledged against liabilities associated with repurchase agreements. 
               (2)   
    Securities available-for-sale are primarily pledged against derivatives, public fund deposits, trust deposits and various short-term and long term borrowings, as well as providing capacity for potential secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB") and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
               (3)   
    Loans are primarily residential mortgage loans pledged against current and potential borrowings from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
               (4)   
    Other assets represent cash on deposit with non-banks related to derivative collateral support agreements. 
     Debt securities pledged as collateral that can be sold or repledged by the secured party continue to be reported on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of securities available-for-sale that could be sold or repledged was   $658 million   and   $1,000 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of trading assets that could be sold or repledged was   $3,323 million   and   $3,797 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The fair value of collateral we accepted under security resale agreements but not reported on the consolidated balance sheet was   $32,118 million   and   $25,058 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, discussed further below. Of this collateral,   $26,478 million   and   $19,558 million   could be sold or repledged at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which   $1,409 million   and   $3,400 million  , respectively, had been sold or repledged as collateral under repurchase agreements or to cover short sales. 
  Repurchase Agreements 
  We enter into purchases of securities under agreements to resell (resale agreements) and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) identical or substantially the same securities. Resale and repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured lending and secured borrowing transactions, respectively. 
  Repurchase agreements may require us to deposit cash or other collateral with the lender. In connection with resale agreements, it is our policy to obtain possession of collateral, which may include the securities purchased, with market value in excess of the principal amount loaned. The market value of the collateral subject to the resale and repurchase agreements is regularly monitored, and additional collateral is obtained or provided when appropriate, to ensure appropriate collateral coverage of these secured financing transactions.

19.    Fair Value Measurements   

Accounting principles related to fair value measurements provide a framework for measuring fair value that focuses on the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market (or in the absence of the principal market, the most advantageous market) accessible in an orderly transaction between willing market participants (the "Fair Value Framework"). Where required by the applicable accounting standards, assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using the "highest and best use" valuation premise. Fair value measurement guidance clarifies that financial instruments do not have alternative use and, as such, the fair value of financial instruments should be determined using an  in-exchange  valuation premise. However, the fair value measurement literature provides a valuation exception and permits an entity to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting credit risks and/or market risks based on the exit price it would receive or pay to transfer the net risk exposure of a group of assets or liabilities if certain conditions are met. We elected to apply the measurement exception to a group of derivative instruments with offsetting credit risks and market risks, which primarily relate to interest rate, foreign currency, debt and equity price risk, and commodity price risk as of the reporting date.  
  Fair Value Adjustments    The best evidence of fair value is quoted market price in an actively traded market, where available. In the event listed price or market quotes are not available, valuation techniques that incorporate relevant transaction data and market parameters reflecting the attributes of the asset or liability under consideration are applied. Where applicable, fair value adjustments are made to ensure the financial instruments are appropriately recorded at fair value. The fair value adjustments reflect the risks associated with the products, contractual terms of the transactions, and the liquidity of the markets in which the transactions occur. The fair value adjustments are broadly categorized by the following major types:  
  Credit risk adjustment   - The credit risk adjustment is an adjustment to a group of financial assets and financial liabilities, predominantly derivative assets and derivative liabilities, to reflect the credit quality of the parties to the transaction in arriving at fair value. A credit valuation adjustment to a financial asset is required to reflect the default risk of the counterparty. A debit valuation adjustment to a financial liability is recorded to reflect the default risk of HUSI. See "Valuation Techniques - Derivatives" below for additional details. 
  Liquidity risk adjustment   - The liquidity risk adjustment (primarily in the form of bid-offer adjustment) reflects the cost that would be incurred to close out the market risks by hedging, disposing or unwinding the position. Valuation models generally produce mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment is made in such a way that results in a measure that reflects the exit price that most represents the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability under consideration or, where applicable, the fair value of the net market risk exposure of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities. These adjustments relate primarily to Level 2 assets. 
  Model valuation adjustment   - Where fair value measurements are determined using an internal valuation model based on observable and unobservable inputs, certain valuation inputs may be less readily determinable. There may be a range of possible valuation inputs that market participants may assume in determining the fair value measurement. The resultant fair value measurement has inherent measurement risk if one or more parameters are unobservable and must be estimated. An input valuation adjustment is necessary to reflect the likelihood that market participants may use different input parameters, and to mitigate the possibility of measurement error. In addition, the values derived from valuation techniques are affected by the choice of valuation model and model limitation. When different valuation techniques are available, the choice of valuation model can be subjective. Furthermore, the valuation model applied may have measurement limitations. In those cases, an additional valuation adjustment is also applied to mitigate the measurement risk. Model valuation adjustments are not material and relate primarily to Level 2 instruments. 
  We apply stress scenarios in determining appropriate liquidity risk and model risk adjustments for Level 3 fair values by reviewing the historical data for unobservable inputs (e.g., correlation, volatility). Some stress scenarios involve at least a 95 percent confidence interval (i.e., two standard deviations). We also utilize unobservable parameter adjustments when instruments are valued using internally developed models which reflects the uncertainty in the value estimates provided by the model.  
  Valuation of uncollateralized derivatives   - During 2014, we adopted a funding fair value adjustment ("FFVA") to reflect the estimated present value of the future market funding cost or benefit associated with funding uncollateralized derivative exposure at rates other than the Overnight Indexed Swap ("OIS") rate. See "Valuation Techniques - Derivatives" below for additional details. 
  Fair Value Hierarchy    The Fair Value Framework establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy as follows:  
  Level 1   quoted market price   - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
  Level 2   valuation technique using observable inputs   - Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are inactive, and measurements determined using valuation models where all significant inputs are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  
  
   58 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Level 3   valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs   - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where fair values are measured using valuation techniques based on one or more significant unobservable inputs.  
  Classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on whether the lowest hierarchical level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is observable. As such, the classification within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic and can be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period. Transfers between leveling categories are assessed, determined and recognized at the end of each reporting period.  
  Valuation Control Framework   We have established a control framework which is designed to ensure that fair values are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the determination of fair values rests with Finance. Finance has established an independent price validation process to ensure that the assets and liabilities measured at fair value are properly stated. 
  A valuation committee, chaired by the Head of Product Control, meets monthly to review, monitor and discuss significant valuation matters arising from credit and market risks. The committee is responsible for reviewing and approving valuation policies and procedures including any valuation adjustments pertaining to, among other things, independent price verification, market liquidity, unobservable inputs, model uncertainty and counterparty credit risk. All valuation models are reviewed by the valuation committee in terms of model development, enhancements and performance. All models are independently reviewed by the Markets Independent Model Review function and applicable valuation model recommendations are reported to and discussed with the valuation committee. Significant valuation risks identified in business activities are corroborated and addressed by the committee members and, where applicable, are escalated to the Chief Financial Officer of HUSI and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
  Where fair value measurements are determined based on information obtained from independent pricing services or brokers, Finance applies appropriate validation procedures to substantiate fair value. For price validation purposes, quotations from at least two independent pricing sources are obtained for each financial instrument, where possible. 
  The following factors are considered in determining fair values: 
             
    similarities between the asset or the liability under consideration and the asset or liability for which quotation is received; 
                
    collaboration of pricing by referencing to other independent market data such as market transactions and relevant benchmark indices; 
                
    consistency among different pricing sources; 
                
    the valuation approach and the methodologies used by the independent pricing sources in determining fair value; 
                
    the elapsed time between the date to which the market data relates and the measurement date;  
                
    the source of the fair value information; and 
                
    whether the security is traded in an active or inactive market. 
     Greater weight is given to quotations of instruments with recent market transactions, pricing quotes from dealers who stand ready to transact, quotations provided by market-makers who structured such instrument and market consensus pricing based on inputs from a large number of survey participants. Any significant discrepancies among the external quotations are reviewed and adjustments to fair values are recorded where appropriate. Where the transaction volume of a specific instrument has been reduced and the fair value measurement becomes less transparent, Finance will apply more detailed procedures to understand and challenge the appropriateness of the unobservable inputs and the valuation techniques used by the independent pricing service. Where applicable, Finance will develop a fair value estimate using its own pricing model inputs to test reasonableness. Where fair value measurements are determined using internal valuation models, Finance will validate the fair value measurement by either developing unobservable inputs based on the industry consensus pricing surveys in which we participate or back testing by observing the actual settlements occurring soon after the measurement date. Any significant valuation adjustments are reported to and discussed with the valuation committee.

Loan values presented in the table above were determined using the Fair Value Framework for measuring fair value, which is based on our best estimate of the amount within a range of value we believe would be received in a sale as of the balance sheet date (i.e. exit price). The secondary market demand and estimated value for our residential mortgage loans has been heavily influenced by economic conditions, including house price depreciation, elevated unemployment, changes in consumer behavior, changes in discount rates and the lack of financing options available to support the purchase of loans. For certain consumer loans which were transferred to held for sale during the third quarter of 2016, investors incorporate numerous assumptions in predicting cash flows, such as future interest rates, higher charge-off levels, slower voluntary prepayment speeds, different default and loss curves and estimated collateral values than we, as the servicer of these loans, believe will ultimately be the case. The investor's valuation process reflects this difference in overall cost of capital assumptions as well as the potential volatility in the underlying cash flow assumptions, the combination of which may yield a significant pricing discount from our intrinsic value. The estimated fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   reflect these market conditions. The increase in the relative fair value of our residential mortgage loans since   December 31, 2015   reflects the conditions in the housing industry which have continued to show improvement in 2016 due to improvements in property values as well as lower required market yields and increased investor demand for these types of loans.

    Structured deposits and structured notes contain embedded derivative features whose fair value measurements contain significant Level 3 inputs. 
     Significant Unobservable Inputs for Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Collateralized Debt Obligations ("CDOs") 
             
    Prepayment rate   - The rate at which borrowers pay off the mortgage loans early. The prepayment rate is affected by a number of factors including the location of the mortgage collateral, the interest rate type of the mortgage loans, borrowers' credit and sensitivity to interest rate movement. The prepayment rate of our CDOs portfolio is tilted towards the low end of the range. 
                
    Default rate -   Annualized percentage of default rate over a group of collateral such as residential or commercial mortgage loans. The default rate and loss severity rate are positively correlated. The default rate of our portfolio is close to the mid-point of the range. 
                
    Loss severity rate   -   Included in our Level 3 CDOs portfolio are collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and trust preferred securities which are about equally distributed. The loss severity rate for trust preferred securities at   September 30, 2016   is about   1.8   times that of CLOs.  
     Derivatives 
             
    Correlation of default   - The default correlation of a group of credit exposures measures the likelihood that the credit references within a group will default together. The default correlation is a significant input to structured credit products such as nth-to- 
     
   69 

HSBC USA Inc. 

default swaps. In addition, the correlation between the currency and the default risk of the reference credits is a critical input to a foreign currency denominated credit default swap where the correlation is not observable.   
             
    Implied volatility   - The implied volatility is a significant pricing input for freestanding or embedded options including equity, foreign currency and interest rate options. The level of volatility is a function of the nature of the underlying risk, the level of strike price and the years to maturity of the option. Depending on the underlying risk and tenure, we determine the implied volatility based on observable input where information is available. However, substantially all of the implied volatilities are derived based on historical information. The implied volatility for different foreign currency pairs is between   15 percent   and   21 percent   while the implied volatility for equity/equity or equity/equity index is between   10 percent   and   50 percent  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . Although implied foreign currency volatility and equity volatility appear to be widely distributed at the portfolio level, the deviation of implied volatility on a trade-by-trade basis is narrower. The average deviation of implied volatility for the foreign currency pair and at-the-money equity option are   4 percent   and   5 percent  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  .  
                
    Correlations of a group of foreign currency or equity   - Correlation measures the relative change in values among two or more variables (i.e., equity or foreign currency pair). Variables can be positively or negatively correlated. Correlation is a key input in determining the fair value of a derivative referenced to a basket of variables such as equities or foreign currencies. A majority of the correlations are not observable, but are derived based on historical data. The correlation between equity/equity and equity/equity index was between   47 percent   and   58 percent   at   September 30, 2016  . 
     Sensitivity of Level 3 Inputs to Fair Value Measurements  
  Collateralized debt obligation  s - Probability of default, prepayment speed and loss severity rate are significant unobservable inputs. Significant increase (decrease) in these inputs will result in a lower (higher) fair value measurement of a collateralized debt obligation. A change in assumption for default probability is often accompanied by a directionally similar change in loss severity, and a directionally opposite change in prepayment speed.  
  Corporate and domestic debt securities   - The fair value measurements of certain corporate debt securities are affected by the fair value of the underlying portfolios of investments used as collateral and the make-whole guarantee provided by third party guarantors. The probability that the collateral fair value declines below the collateral call threshold concurrent with the guarantors' failure to perform its make whole obligation is unobservable. The increase (decrease) in the probability the collateral value falls below the collateral call threshold is often accompanied by a directionally similar change in default probability of the guarantor.  
  Credit derivatives   - Correlation of default among a basket of reference credit names is a significant unobservable input if the credit attributes of the portfolio are not within the parameters of relevant standardized CDS indices. Significant increase (decrease) in the unobservable input will result in a lower (higher) fair value measurement of the credit derivative. A change in assumption for default correlation is often accompanied by a directionally similar change in default probability and loss rates of other credit names in the basket.  
  Equity and foreign exchange derivatives   - The fair value measurement of a structured equity or foreign exchange derivative is primarily affected by the implied volatility of the underlying equity price or exchange rate of the paired foreign currencies. The implied volatility is not observable. Significant increase (decrease) in the implied volatility will result in a higher (lower) fair value of a long position in the derivative contract.  
  Significant Transfers Into and Out of Level 3 Measurements    During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we transferred   $57 million   and   $198 million  , respectively, of domestic deposits and   $67 million   and   $213 million  , respectively, of long-term debt, which we have elected to carry at fair value, from Level 3 to Level 2 as a result of the embedded derivative no longer being unobservable as the derivative option is closer to maturity and there is more observability in short term volatility. During the third quarter of 2016, we transferred   $95 million   of mortgage servicing rights from Level 3 to Level 2 upon execution of the sale agreement with a third party. Additionally, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we transferred   $39 million   and   $54 million  , respectively, of domestic deposits, which we have elected to carry at fair value, from Level 2 to Level 3 as a result of a change in the observability of underlying instruments that resulted in the embedded derivative being unobservable. 
  During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we transferred   $54 million   and   $233 million  , respectively, of domestic deposits and   $18 million   and   $50 million  , respectively, of long-term debt, which we have elected to carry at fair value, from Level 3 to Level 2 as a result of the embedded derivative no longer being unobservable as the derivative option is closer in maturity and there is more observability in short term volatility. Additionally, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we transferred   $44 million   and   $66 million  , respectively, of domestic deposits, which we have elected to carry at fair value, from Level 2 to Level 3 as a result of a change in the observability of underlying instruments that resulted in the embedded derivative being unobservable.

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis    Certain financial and non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and therefore, are not included in the tables above. These assets include (a) mortgage and commercial loans classified as held for sale reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and (b) impaired loans or assets that are written down to fair value based on the valuation of underlying collateral during the period. These instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustment in certain circumstances (e.g., impairment). The following table presents the fair value hierarchy level within which the fair value of the financial and non-financial assets has been recorded at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The gains (losses) during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   are also included. 

(1)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the loans held for sale was below cost. Certain residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans held for sale have been classified as Level 3 fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy, including certain residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans which were transferred to held for sale during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   for which significant inputs in estimating fair value were unobservable and, to a lesser extent, certain residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the underlying real estate properties used to determine fair value are illiquid assets as a result of market conditions. Additionally, the fair value of these properties is affected by, among other things, the location, the payment history and the completeness of the loan documentation. 
               (2)   
    Represents residential mortgage loans held for investment whose carrying amount was reduced during the periods presented based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Total gains (losses) for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   include amounts recorded on loans that were subsequently transferred to held for sale. 
                (4)   
    Certain commercial loans have undergone troubled debt restructurings and are considered impaired. As a matter of practical expedient, we measure the credit impairment of a collateral-dependent loan based on the fair value of the collateral asset. The collateral often involves real estate properties that are illiquid due to market conditions. As a result, these loans are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy. 
               (5)   
    Real estate owned is required to be reported on the balance sheet net of transactions costs. The real estate owned amounts in the table above reflect the fair value unadjusted for transaction costs.

Significant Unobservable Inputs for Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements    
  Residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans held for sale represent residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans which were transferred to held for sale during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and, to a lesser extent, subprime residential mortgage loans which were previously acquired with the intent of securitizing or selling them to third parties. The weighted average loss severity rate for residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans held for sale was approximately   52 percent   at   September 30, 2016  . These severity rates are primarily impacted by the value of the underlying collateral securing the loans. 
  Impaired loans represent commercial loans. The weighted average severity rate for these loans was approximately   34 percent   at   September 30, 2016  . These severity rates are primarily impacted by the value of the underlying collateral securing the loans. 
  Valuation Techniques    Following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and for estimating fair value for those financial instruments not recorded at fair value for which fair value disclosure is required.  
  Short-term financial assets and liabilities -   The carrying amount of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost is considered to approximate fair value because they are short-term in nature, bear interest rates that approximate market rates, and generally have negligible credit risk. These items include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks, customer acceptance assets and liabilities, short-term borrowings and dividends payable.  
  Federal funds sold and purchased and securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements -   We record certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements at fair value. The fair value of these resale and repurchase agreements is determined using market rates currently offered on comparable transactions with similar underlying collateral and maturities. 
  The remaining federal funds sold and purchased and securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements are recorded at cost. A majority of these transactions are short-term in nature and, as such, the recorded amounts approximate fair value. For transactions with long-dated maturities, fair value is based on dealer quotes for instruments with similar terms and collateral.  
  Loans   - Except for certain commercial loans held for sale for which the fair value option has been elected, we do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. From time to time, we record impairments to loans. The write-downs can be based on observable market price of the loan, the underlying collateral value or a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, fair value estimates are determined based on the product type, financial characteristics, pricing features and maturity.  
             
    Loans held for sale   Consumer and commercial loans held for sale (that are not designated under FVO as discussed below) are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The fair value estimates of consumer and commercial loans held for sale are determined primarily using the discounted cash flow method using assumptions consistent with those which would be used by market participants in valuing such loans. Valuation inputs include estimates of prepayment rates, default rates, loss severities, collateral values and market rates of return. Where available, such inputs are derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Since some loan pools may have features which are unique, the fair value measurement processes use  
     
   72 

HSBC USA Inc. 

significant unobservable inputs which are specific to the performance characteristics of the various loan portfolios. Where available, we measure residential mortgage whole loans held for sale based on transaction prices of loan portfolios of similar characteristics observed in the whole loan market. Adjustments are made to reflect differences in collateral location, loan-to-value ratio, FICO scores, vintage year, default rates, the completeness of the loan documentation     and other risk characteristics. 
             
    Commercial loans held for sale designated under FVO   We record certain commercial loans held for sale at fair value. Where available, fair value is based on observable market consensus pricing obtained from independent sources, relevant broker quotes or observed market prices of instruments with similar characteristics. Where observable market parameters are not available, fair value is determined based on contractual cash flows adjusted for estimates of prepayment rates, expected default rates and loss severity discounted at management's estimate of the expected rate of return required by market participants. We also consider loan specific risk mitigating factors such as collateral arrangements in determining the fair value estimate. 
                
    Commercial loans   Commercial loans and commercial real estate loans are valued by discounting the contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayments and the borrower s credit risk, using a discount rate that reflects the current rates offered to borrowers of similar credit standing for the remaining term to maturity and, when applicable, our own estimate of liquidity premium. 
                
    Commercial impaired loans   Generally represents collateral dependent commercial loans with fair value determined based on pricing quotes obtained from an independent third party appraisal. 
                
    Consumer loans   The estimated fair value of our consumer loans were determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources as appropriate for the respective pool of assets. These sources included estimates from an HSBC affiliate which reflect over-the-counter trading activity; trading input from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades; where appropriate, the impact of current estimated rating agency credit tranching levels with the associated benchmark credit spreads; general discussions held directly with potential investors; and, at December 31, 2015, forward looking discounted cash flow models using assumptions consistent with those which would be used by market participants in valuing such loans. Since some loan pools may have features which are unique, the fair value measurement processes use significant unobservable inputs which are specific to the performance characteristics of the various loan portfolios. For revolving products, the estimated fair value excludes future draws on the available credit line as well as other items and, therefore, does not include the fair value of the entire relationship. 
     We perform analytical reviews of fair value changes on a quarterly basis and periodically validate our valuation methodologies and assumptions based on the results of actual sales of loans with similar characteristics. In addition, from time to time, we may engage a third party valuation specialist to measure the fair value of a pool of loans. Portfolio risk management personnel provide further validation through discussions with third party brokers and other market participants.  
  Lending-related commitments   - The fair value of commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are not included in the table. The majority of the lending related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis nor are they actively traded. These instruments generate fees, which approximate those currently charged to originate similar commitments, which are recognized over the term of the commitment period. Deferred fees on commitments and standby letters of credit totaled   $49 million   and   $54 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Precious metals trading   - Precious metals trading primarily includes physical inventory which is valued using spot prices.  
     Securities   - Where available, debt and equity securities are valued based on quoted market prices. If a quoted market price for the identical security is not available, the security is valued based on quotes from similar securities, where possible. For certain securities, internally developed valuation models are used to determine fair values or validate quotes obtained from pricing services. The following summarizes the valuation methodology used for our major security classes:  
             
    U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency issued or guaranteed and obligations of U.S. state and political subdivisions   As these securities transact in an active market, fair value measurements are based on quoted prices for the identical security or quoted prices for similar securities with adjustments as necessary made using observable inputs which are market corroborated. 
                
    U.S. Government sponsored enterprises   For government sponsored mortgage-backed securities which transact in an active market, fair value measurements are based on quoted prices for the identical security or quoted prices for similar securities with adjustments as necessary made using observable inputs which are market corroborated. For government sponsored mortgage-backed securities which do not transact in an active market, fair value is determined primarily based on pricing information obtained from pricing services and is verified by internal review processes. 
                
    Asset-backed securities, including collateralized debt obligations   Fair value is primarily determined based on pricing information obtained from independent pricing services adjusted for the characteristics and the performance of the underlying collateral. 
                
    Other domestic debt and foreign debt securities (corporate and government) - For non-callable corporate securities, a credit spread scale is created for each issuer. These spreads are then added to the equivalent maturity U.S. Treasury yield to determine current pricing. Credit spreads are obtained from the new market, secondary trading levels and dealer quotes. For securities with early redemption features, an option adjusted spread model is incorporated to adjust the spreads determined above.  
     
   73 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Additionally, we survey the broker/dealer community to obtain relevant trade data including benchmark quotes and updated spreads. 
             
    Equity securities   Except for certain legacy investments in hedge funds, fair value measurements are determined based on quoted prices for the identical security. For hedge fund investments, we receive monthly statements from the investment manager with the estimated fair value. 
     The following tables provide additional information relating to asset-backed securities as well as certain collateralized debt obligations held at   September 30, 2016  : 
  Trading asset-backed securities: 

Available-for-sale securities backed by collateral: 

(1)     
    We utilize S P as the primary source of credit ratings in the tables above. If S P ratings are not available, ratings by Moody's and Fitch are used in that order. Ratings for collateralized debt obligations represent the ratings associated with the underlying collateral. 
     Derivatives     Derivatives are recorded at fair value. Asset and liability positions in individual derivatives that are covered by legally enforceable master netting agreements, including receivables (payables) for cash collateral posted (received), are offset and presented net in accordance with accounting principles which allow the offsetting of amounts.  
  Derivatives traded on an exchange are valued using quoted prices. OTC derivatives, which comprise a majority of derivative contract positions, are valued using valuation techniques. The fair value for the majority of our derivative instruments are determined based on internally developed models that utilize independently corroborated market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities, and currency rates. For complex or long-dated derivative products where market data is not available, fair value may be affected by the underlying assumptions about, among other things, the timing of cash flows, expected exposure, probability of default and recovery rates. The fair values of certain structured derivative products are sensitive to unobservable inputs such as default correlations of the referenced credit and volatilities of embedded options. These estimates are susceptible to significant change in future periods as market conditions change. 
  We use the OIS curves as inputs to measure the fair value of collateralized derivatives. Historically, we valued uncollateralized derivatives by discounting expected future cash flows at a benchmark interest rate, typically LIBOR or its equivalent. In line with evolving industry practice, we changed this approach during 2014. We now view the OIS curve as the base discounting curve for all derivatives, both collateralized and uncollateralized, and have adopted a FFVA to reflect the estimated present value of the future market funding cost or benefit associated with funding uncollateralized derivative exposure at rates other than the OIS rate. This is an area in which a full industry consensus has not yet emerged. We will continue to monitor industry evolution and refine the calculation methodology as necessary. 
  Significant inputs related to derivative classes are broken down as follows: 
             
    Credit Derivatives   Use credit default curves and recovery rates which are generally provided by broker quotes and various pricing services. Certain credit derivatives may also use correlation inputs in their model valuation. Correlation is derived using market quotes from brokers and various pricing services. 
     
   74 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Interest Rate Derivatives   Swaps use interest rate curves based on currency that are actively quoted by brokers and other pricing services. Options will also use volatility inputs which are also quoted in the broker market. 
                
    Foreign Exchange ("FX") Derivatives   FX transactions, to the extent possible, use spot and forward FX rates which are quoted in the broker market. Where applicable, we also use implied volatility of currency pairs as inputs. 
                
    Equity Derivatives   Use listed equity security pricing and implied volatilities from equity traded options position. 
                
    Precious Metal Derivatives   Use spot and forward metal rates which are quoted in the broker market. 
     As discussed earlier, we make fair value adjustments to model valuations in order to ensure that those values represent appropriate estimates of fair value. These adjustments, which are applied consistently over time, are generally required to reflect factors such as bid-ask spreads and counterparty credit risk that can affect prices in arms-length transactions with unrelated third parties. Such adjustments are based on management judgment and may not be observable.  
  We estimate the counterparty credit risk for financial assets and own credit standing for financial liabilities (the "credit risk adjustments") in determining the fair value measurement. For derivative instruments, we calculate the credit risk adjustment by applying the probability of default of the counterparty to the expected exposure, and multiplying the result by the expected loss given default. We also take into consideration the risk mitigating factors including collateral agreements and master netting agreements in determining credit risk adjustments. We estimate the implied probability of default based on the credit spread of the specific counterparty observed in the credit default swap market. Where credit default spread of the counterparty is not available, we use the credit default spread of a specific proxy (e.g. the credit default swap spread of the counterparty's parent). Where specific proxy credit default swap is not available, we apply a blended approach based on a combination of credit default swaps referencing to credit names of similar credit standing and the historical rating-based probability of default. 
  Real estate owned   - Fair value is determined based on third party appraisals obtained at the time we take title to the property and, if less than the carrying amount of the loan, the carrying amount of the loan is adjusted to the fair value. The carrying amount of the property is further reduced, if necessary, at least every   45   days to reflect observable local market data, including local area sales data. 
  Mortgage servicing rights   - We elected to measure residential mortgage servicing rights at fair value and, prior to March 2016, classified them as intangible assets. In March 2016, we initiated an active program to sell our remaining MSRs portfolio and reclassified them to held for sale within other assets. At September 30, 2016, fair value for the residential mortgage servicing rights is determined based upon the sales price formula as defined in the executed sales agreement. Previously, fair value for the residential mortgage servicing rights was determined based on an option adjusted approach which involves discounting servicing cash flows under various interest rate projections at risk-adjusted rates. The valuation model also incorporated our best estimate of the prepayment speed of the mortgage loans, cost to service and discount rates which are unobservable. 
  Structured notes     and deposits     Structured notes and deposits are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives and are elected to be measured at fair value in their entirety under fair value option accounting principles. The valuation of hybrid instruments is predominantly driven by the derivative features embedded within the instruments and own credit risk. The valuation of embedded derivatives may include significant unobservable inputs such as correlation of the referenced credit names or volatility of the embedded option. Cash flows of the funded notes and deposits in their entirety, including the embedded derivatives, are discounted at the relevant interest rates for the duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit spreads. The credit spreads so applied are determined with reference to our own debt issuance rates observed in primary and secondary markets, internal funding rates, and the structured note rates in recent executions. 
  Long-term debt     We elected to apply fair value option to certain own debt issuances for which fair value hedge accounting otherwise would have been applied. These own debt issuances elected under FVO are traded in secondary markets and, as such, the fair value is determined based on observed prices for the specific instrument. The observed market price of these instruments reflects the effect of our own credit spreads. The credit spreads applied to these instruments were derived from the spreads at the measurement date. 
  For long-term debt recorded at cost, fair value is determined based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on dealer quotes, quoted prices of similar instruments, or internally developed valuation models adjusted for own credit risks. 
  Deposits     For fair value disclosure purposes, the carrying amount of deposits with no stated maturity (e.g., demand, savings, and certain money market deposits), which represents the amount payable upon demand, is considered to generally approximate fair value. For deposits with stated maturities, fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using market interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and maturities.

The following supplements, and should be read together with, the disclosure in Note 27, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 20, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our Form 10-Q for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 (the "2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q") and the six month period ended June 30, 2016 (the "2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q"). Only those matters with significant updates and new matters since our disclosure in our 2015 Form 10-K, our 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and our 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q are reported herein. 
  In addition to the matters described below, and in our 2015 Form 10-K, our 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and our 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q, in the ordinary course of business, we are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to activities of our current and/or former operations. These legal actions and proceedings may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief. In the ordinary course of business, we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, we receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of our regulated activities.  
  In view of the inherent unpredictability of legal matters, including litigation, governmental and regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate or when the proceedings or investigations are in the early stages, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters or the eventual loss, fines, penalties or business impact, if any, that may result. We establish reserves for litigation, governmental and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Once established, reserves are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The actual costs of resolving litigation and regulatory matters, however, may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for those matters.  
  For the legal matters disclosed below, including litigation and governmental and regulatory matters, as well as for the legal matters disclosed in Note 27, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 20, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and our 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q as to which a loss in excess of accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods and for which there is sufficient currently available information on the basis of which management believes it can make a reliable estimate, we believe a reasonable estimate could be as much as   $330 million   for HUSI. The legal matters underlying this estimate of possible loss will change from time to time and actual results may differ significantly from this current estimate. 
  Based on the facts currently known, in respect of each of the below investigations as well as for the investigations disclosed in Note 27, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 20, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in our 2016 First Quarter Form 10-Q and our 2016 Second Quarter Form 10-Q, it is not practicable at this time for us to determine the terms on which these ongoing investigations will be resolved or the timing of such resolution. As matters progress, it is possible that any fines and/or penalties could be significant. 
  Given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in any particular quarterly or annual period.

21.    New Accounting Pronouncements 

The following new accounting pronouncement was adopted effective January 1, 2016: 
             
    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis    In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") which rescinds the deferral of VIE consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in certain investment funds and provides a new scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. The ASU makes several other amendments including a) the elimination of certain criteria previously used for determining whether fees paid to a decision maker represent a variable interest; b) revising the consolidation model for limited partnerships and similar entities which could be variable interest entities or voting interest entities; c) excluding certain fees paid to a decision maker from the risk and benefit test in the primary beneficiary determination if certain conditions are met; and d) reduces the application of the related party guidance for VIEs. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations; however, one of our unconsolidated limited partnership investments related to renewable energy became a VIE under the new guidance. Disclosure of this unconsolidated VIE is included under the caption "Limited partnership investments" in Note 17, "Variable Interest Entities." 
     The following are accounting pronouncements which will be adopted in future periods: 
             
    Recognition of Revenue from Contracts with Customers    In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU which provides a principles-based framework for revenue recognition that supersedes virtually all previously issued revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the ASU requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The core principle of the five-step revenue recognition framework is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. While the ASU as originally issued was scheduled to be effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017, in August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year, but provided entities the option to adopt it as of the original effective date. The amendments in the ASU may be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized in equity at the date of initial application. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Financial Instruments - Classification and Measurement    In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which changes aspects of its guidance on classification and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Under a practicability exception, entities may measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. Under this exception, a qualitative assessment for impairment will be required and, if impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investments must be adjusted to their fair value and an impairment loss recognized in net income. For financial liabilities measured under the fair value option, the ASU requires recognizing the change in fair value attributable to our own credit in other comprehensive income. Additionally, the ASU requires new disclosure related to equity investments and modifies certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and the guidance should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet or, as it relates to equity investments without readily determinable fair values, prospectively. Early adoption of the amendment related to financial liabilities measured under the fair value option is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on our financial statements and will result in recognizing the change in fair value attributable to our own credit risk in other comprehensive income where previously these amounts were recognized in net income. The adoption of this guidance will also require a cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet, which will result in a reclassification from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the remaining guidance in this ASU. 
                
    Leases    In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which requires a lessee to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months. Lease classification will determine whether a lease is reported as a financing transaction in the income statement and statement of cash flows. The ASU does not substantially change lessor accounting, but it does make certain changes related to leases for which collectability of the lease payments is uncertain or there are significant variable payments. Additionally, the ASU makes several other targeted amendments including a) revising the definition of lease payments to include fixed payments by the lessee to cover lessor costs related to ownership of the underlying asset such as for property taxes or insurance; b) narrowing the definition of initial direct costs which an entity is permitted to capitalize to include only those incremental costs of a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained; c) requiring seller-lessees in a sale-leaseback transaction to recognize the entire gain from the sale of the underlying asset at the time of sale rather than over the leaseback term; and d) expanding disclosures to provide quantitative and qualitative information about lease transactions. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019 and is required to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented at the date of initial application, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. 
                
    Compensation - Stock Compensation    In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies for share-based payment awards to be recorded as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement and for excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, entities elect whether to account for forfeitures of awards by either recognizing forfeitures as they occur or by estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited. Additionally, the ASU allows entities to withhold up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate to cover income taxes on awards and classify the entire awards as equity. Cash paid to satisfy the statutory income tax withholding obligation must be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in the ASU have various transition requirements with certain amendments required to be applied retrospectively. We do not anticipate a significant impact upon adoption of this ASU. 
                
    Financial Instruments - Credit Impairment    In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The ASU requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans (including TDR Loans), held-to-maturity debt securities, off-balance sheet credit exposures and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost. The ASU also requires entities to recognize an allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities and revises the accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Additionally, the ASU requires new disclosures, the more significant of which include a) for financial assets measured at cost, information about how an entity developed its allowance, including changes in the factors that influenced the estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes; b) for financing receivables, further disaggregation of credit quality indicators by year of origination; and c) for AFS debt securities, a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses and an aging analysis of securities that are past due. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019, and is required to be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. 
     
   78 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, the portions of the cash payments attributable to accreted interest for the settlement of zero-coupon bonds should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities. The ASU is effective for all annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU. 
     There have been no additional accounting pronouncements issued during the first nine months of 2016 that are expected to have or could have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Executive Overview                 

HSBC USA is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") as "we", "us" or "our". 
  Economic Environment    The U.S. economy continued its trend of slow growth during the first nine months of 2016. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") is currently forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in 2016, slightly slower than 2015's GDP growth rate of 2.1 percent, although U.S. manufacturing growth in 2016 is expected to increase faster than GDP. Inflation in 2016 continues to run below the Federal Reserve Board's ("FRB") 2.0 percent target inflation rate. Although there is speculation that the FRB may increase short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in the fourth quarter, the prolonged period of low interest rates continues to put pressure on spreads earned on our deposit base. The U.S. economy added approximately 1.6 million jobs during the first nine months of 2016 although total unemployment remained unchanged at 5.0 percent at September 2016 as compared with December 2015 as the number of job seekers continued to grow. An elevated number of part-time workers continue to seek full-time work and the number of discouraged people who have stopped looking for work remains elevated, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' U-6 unemployment rate of 9.7 percent at September 2016, as compared with a rate of 9.9 percent at year-end.  
  Despite the continued improvement of the U.S. economy, economic uncertainty remains high in many economies outside the U.S., including China as well as Latin America and in particular Brazil, where economic activity continues to be slow, with the decision by the United Kingdom in late June to exit the EU further adding to this global uncertainty. In addition, although the price of oil increased during the nine months of 2016, it declined significantly during 2015 and remains depressed compared with historical levels in part due to the strong U.S. dollar, adding pressure to portfolios where the customer base is heavily centered in commodity-based businesses. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. These conditions in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy, geopolitical concerns and the heightened regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2016 and beyond. 
  Performance, Developments and Trends    The following table sets forth selected financial highlights of HSBC USA for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

(1)   
    Excludes loans held for sale. 
               (2)   
    Represents period end loans, net of allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of domestic deposits equal to or less than $100,000. 
     Net income was   $33 million   and   $166 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $204 million   and   $455 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Net income in the prior year-to-date period reflects the impact of New York City tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax expense of $48 million during the second quarter of 2015. 
  Income before income tax was   $59 million   and   $266 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $315 million   and   $740 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in income before income tax during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due primarily to lower other revenues and a higher provision for credit losses which were partially offset in the year-to-date period by lower operating expenses and higher net interest income. 
  Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant which distorts comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented: 

(1)   
    Reflects transformation costs to deliver the cost reduction and productivity outcomes outlined in the HSBC Investor Update in June 2015. 
               (2)   
    Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.

Excluding the collective impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     declined   $113 million   and   $294 million  , respectively, compared with the prior year periods due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio and lower other revenues which were partially offset in the year-to-date period by lower operating expenses and higher net interest income. Lower other revenues in both the three and nine month periods was driven by lower other income and lower fair value option revenue, partially offset by higher trading revenue. 
  See "Results of Operations" for more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends. 
  In addition to the residential mortgage sales program discussed below, during the third quarter of 2016, we decided we no longer have the intent to hold for investment a portfolio of residential mortgage loans that we previously purchased from HSBC Finance Corporation ("HSBC Finance"), along with any home equity mortgage balances associated with these loans. As a result of this decision, during the third quarter of 2016, we transferred residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans to held for sale with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $648 million   at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these loans prior to transfer, after considering the fair value of the property less costs to sell, as applicable, was approximately   $628 million  , including accrued interest. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an initial lower of cost or fair value adjustment of   $11 million   associated with the newly transferred loans, all of which was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. As we plan to sell these loans to third party investors, fair value represents the price we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the loans.  
  During the first quarter of 2016 we decided we no longer have the intent to hold for investment certain residential mortgage loans and adopted a formal program to initiate sale activities for these residential mortgage loans when a loan meeting pre-determined criteria is written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell (generally 180 days past due) in accordance with our existing charge-off policies. These loans were largely originated by us prior to the implementation of our Premier strategy. Under this program, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we transferred residential mortgage loans to held for sale with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $25 million   and   $549 million  , respectively, at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these loans prior to transfer, after considering the fair value of the property less costs to sell, was approximately   $23 million   and   $456 million  , including related escrow advances, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of   $4 million   and   $42 million  , respectively, associated with newly transferred loans, all of which was attributed to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $2 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on these loans held for sale as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income as a result of a change in the estimated pricing on specific pools of loans. As we plan to sell these loans to third party investors, fair value represents the price we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the loan portfolios. 
  In March 2016, we initiated an active program to sell our remaining Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSRs") portfolio which has been in run-off for several years. As a result, we now consider the MSRs portfolio and related servicing advances, which together totaled   $303 million  , to be held for sale at September 30, 2016 and reported them in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our remaining MSRs portfolio to a third party and expect the sale to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. As the MSRs continue to be carried at fair value and we expect to transfer the related servicing advances to the buyer at near cost, the resulting gain or loss on sale, including transaction costs, is not expected to be significant. 
  In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved a referendum to withdraw its membership from the EU. While we continue to actively monitor our portfolio to ensure that we quickly identify and manage any areas of stress, our United Kingdom and European capital markets exposure is limited, and we currently do not anticipate this decision will have a significant impact on our operations. 
  As previously reported, as a result of the adoption of the final rules by the U.S. banking regulators implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee, together with the impact of similar implementation by United Kingdom banking regulators, we continue to review the composition of our capital structure. During the second quarter of 2016, HSBC USA redeemed all of its remaining externally issued preferred stock, including its Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series F Preferred Stock, Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series G Preferred Stock and   6.50 percent   Non-Cumulative Series H Preferred Stock, at their stated values of   $25   per share,   $1,000   per share and   $1,000   per share, respectively, resulting in a total cash payment of   $1,265 million  . In connection with these redemptions, HSBC USA issued   1,265   shares of   6.0 percent   Non-Cumulative Series I Preferred Stock to HSBC North America in exchange for cash consideration of   $1,265 million  . 
  Our operations are focused on the core activities of our four global businesses and the positioning of our activities towards international connectivity strategies, including what we believe are our unique capabilities to serve clients in the North American Free Trade Agreement trade corridor in order to improve profitability. We also continue to focus on cost optimization efforts to  
  
   84 

HSBC USA Inc. 

ensure realization of cost efficiencies. To date, we have identified and implemented various opportunities to reduce costs through organizational structure redesign, vendor spending, discretionary spending and other general efficiency initiatives which have resulted in workforce reductions. Additional cost reduction opportunities have been identified and are in the process of implementation. These efforts continue and, as a result, we may incur restructuring charges in future periods, the amount of which will depend upon the actions that ultimately are implemented. We also continue to evaluate our overall operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. This could result in further strategic actions that may include changes to our legal structure, asset levels, cost structure or product offerings in support of HSBC s strategic priorities. 

Basis of Reporting 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). 
  Group Reporting Basis   We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors net income under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis net income: 

Loan impairment charges under the Group Reporting Basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were greater than under U.S. GAAP due to the default of certain credits where existing loan impairment allowances, prior to default, were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP due to the shorter loss emergence period utilized for computing loan impairment allowances for commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment under the Group Reporting Basis. 
  The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results presented in the table above are discussed in more detail within "Basis of Reporting" in our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes since December 31, 2015 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis impacting our results.

Balance Sheet Review                 

We utilize deposits and borrowings from various sources to provide liquidity, fund balance sheet growth, meet cash and capital needs, and fund investments in subsidiaries. The following table provides balance sheet totals at   September 30, 2016   and increases (decreases) since   December 31, 2015  : 

Short-Term Investments    Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments increased since   December 31, 2015   driven by our conservative liquidity management practices, where we raise funds in advance of their usage and opportunistically deploy them to maximize returns.

Loans, Net    The following summarizes our loan balances at   September 30, 2016   and increases (decreases) since   December 31, 2015  :  

(1)   
    Represents large multinational firms including globally focused U.S. corporate and financial institutions and U.S. dollar lending to multinational banking customers managed by HSBC on a global basis. Also includes loans to HSBC affiliates which totaled   $4,463 million   and   $4,815 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
     Commercial loans decreased compared with   December 31, 2015   largely due to paydowns and maturities exceeding new loan originations as we focused efforts on improving returns through disciplined lending and expanding customer relationships into other products. The decrease also reflects the transfer of certain global banking loans with a carrying value of   $1,088 million   to held for sale during the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by the transfer of certain commercial real estate loans with a carrying value of   $612 million   back to held for investment from held for sale during the second quarter of 2016. The decline in commercial loans, including the impact of transfers, was primarily in the banking and health care industries. 
  Consumer loans decreased compared with   December 31, 2015   due primarily to the transfers of certain residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of   $1,007 million   to held for sale during the first nine months of 2016 (  $638 million   of which occurred in the third quarter) as discussed below, partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage loans as we continue to target new residential mortgage loan originations towards our Premier and Advance customer relationships and sell newly originated conforming loans to PHH Mortgage Corporation ("PHH Mortgage"). Home equity mortgages also decreased reflecting net paydowns as our focus continues to shift towards residential mortgage loans. The declines in credit card receivables and other consumer loans reflects paydowns. 
  We have seen a general improvement in the loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our mortgage loan portfolio. The following table presents LTVs for our mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale: 

(1)   
    LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of  
     
   87 

HSBC USA Inc. 

loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house pricing index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure.  
            (2)   
    Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at   June 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, respectively. 
     Loans Held for Sale    The following table summarizes loans held for sale at   September 30, 2016   and increases (decreases) since   December 31, 2015  : 

* 
    Not meaningful. 
     Commercial loans held for sale decreased compared with   December 31, 2015  . During the second quarter of 2016, we sold   $1,161 million   of commercial real estate loans to a third party and recognized a loss on sale of approximately   $3 million  , including transaction costs. Upon completion of the sale, the remaining loans that were not sold, which had a carrying value of   $612 million   at June 30, 2016, were transferred back to held for investment as we now intend to hold these loans for the foreseeable future. 
  Global banking loans held for sale includes commercial loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as commercial loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans, which we have elected to designate under the fair value option, totaled   $649 million   and   $151 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity.  
  Global banking loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and transferred to held for sale which totaled   $92 million   and   $49 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We recorded lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments associated with the write-down of commercial loans held for sale of   $7 million   and   $37 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $2 million   and   $16 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income (loss). 
  Consumer loans held for sale increased compared with   December 31, 2015  . As previously disclosed, we continue to evaluate our overall operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies, as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, as well as continued market demand for non-performing residential mortgage loans, during the first quarter of 2016 we decided we no longer have the intent to hold for investment certain residential mortgage loans and adopted a formal program to initiate sale activities for these residential mortgage loans when a loan meeting pre-determined criteria is written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell (generally 180 days past due) in accordance with our existing charge-off policies. These loans were largely originated by us prior to the implementation of our Premier strategy.  
  Under this program, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we transferred residential mortgage loans to held for sale with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $25 million   and   $549 million  , respectively, at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these loans prior to transfer, after considering the fair value of the property less costs to sell, was approximately   $23 million   and   $456 million  , respectively, including related escrow advances.

In addition to the residential mortgage sales program discussed above, during the third quarter of 2016, we decided we no longer have the intent to hold for investment a portfolio of residential mortgage loans that we previously purchased from HSBC Finance, along with any home equity mortgage balances associated with these loans. As a result of this decision, during the third quarter of 2016, we transferred residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans to held for sale with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately   $648 million   at the time of transfer. The carrying value of these loans prior to transfer, after considering the fair value of the property less costs to sell, as applicable, was approximately   $628 million  , including accrued interest. 
  We also continue to sell all our agency eligible residential mortgage loan originations servicing released directly to PHH Mortgage. Residential mortgage loans held for sale also includes subprime residential mortgage loans with a fair value of   $3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   which were previously acquired from unaffiliated third parties and from HSBC Finance with the intent of securitizing or selling the loans to third parties. 
  Other consumer loans held for sale reflects student loans which we no longer originate.  
  Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was   $60 million   and   $13 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was   $54 million   and   $21 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Trading Assets and Liabilities    The following table summarizes trading assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and increases (decreases) since   December 31, 2015  : 

* 
    Not meaningful. 
               (1)   
    See Note 2, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category. 
               (2)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the fair value of derivatives included in trading assets has been reduced by   $4,463 million   and   $4,652 million  , respectively, relating to amounts recognized for the obligation to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties.  
               (3)   
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the fair value of derivatives included in trading liabilities has been reduced by   $1,305 million   and   $1,530 million  , respectively, relating to amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral paid under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. 
     Securities balances increased compared with   December 31, 2015   due primarily to increases in foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions, including the impact of favorable market valuations. Securities positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate and credit derivative products issued to customers of domestic and emerging markets. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased increased compared with   December 31, 2015   due to an increase in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio. 
  Precious metals trading assets increased compared with   December 31, 2015   driven largely by increases in our own silver and gold inventory positions held as hedges for client activity as well as higher spot prices for these metals. Payables for precious metals were lower reflecting a decrease in borrowing of gold and silver inventory. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above. 
  
   89 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Derivative asset balances decreased compared with   December 31, 2015   as increased netting associated with an increase in central counterparty clearing was partially offset by market movements. Derivative liability balances were relatively flat compared with   December 31, 2015   as the impact of increased netting was offset by market movements. Market movements resulted in higher valuations of interest rate derivatives and, to a lesser extent, equity derivatives which were partially offset by lower valuations of foreign exchange and credit derivatives. Market movements on commodity derivatives were mixed resulting in lower derivative asset valuations, but higher derivative liability valuations. 
  Securities    Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity. The increase in balances compared with   December 31, 2015   largely reflects net purchases of longer term U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as well as favorable market valuations, partially offset by net sales of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes based on the current interest rate environment and liquidity needs. 
  Other Assets    Other assets includes intangibles and goodwill. Other assets decreased compared with   December 31, 2015   largely due to lower outstanding settlement balances related to security sales, lower tax assets and lower cash collateral posted. In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our remaining MSRs portfolio to a third party and expect the sale to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note 9, "Other Assets Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, with the fair value of each reporting unit being 125 percent or more of book value, including allocated goodwill. 
  Deposits    The following summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at   September 30, 2016   and increases (decreases) since   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $100,000. 
     Deposit balances increased since   December 31, 2015   driven by higher deposits from affiliates and growth in commercial savings and demand deposits reflecting a focus on deposit growth through a continuation of executing a key strategy to grow our Global Liquidity and Cash Management business. The strategy for our core retail banking business includes building relationship deposits across multiple markets, channels and segments. This strategy involves various initiatives, such as: 
             
    HSBC Premier, a comprehensive banking and wealth management proposition for the internationally minded mass affluent client with a dedicated premier relationship manager. Total Premier deposits increased to   $23,874 million   at   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $23,498 million   at   December 31, 2015  ; and 
                
    Expanding our existing customer relationships by needs-based sales of wealth, banking and mortgage products. 
     We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to increase profitability while maintaining adequate liquidity. 
  Short-Term Borrowings    Short-term borrowings increased compared with   December 31, 2015   primarily due to a shift in mix which resulted in lower netting associated with securities sold under repurchase agreements. 
  Long-Term Debt    Long-term debt increased compared with   December 31, 2015   reflecting the impact of debt issuances, including $4,000 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America during the third quarter of 2016 and increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB"), partially offset by debt retirements. Debt issuances during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $5,116 million   and   $7,675 million  , respectively, of which   $4,000 million   and   $5,103 million  , respectively, was issued by HSBC Bank USA.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled   $3 million   during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Total debt outstanding under this program was   $4,442 million   and   $4,476 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels. 
  Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled   $2,572 million   of senior structured notes during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  .     Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was   $21,967 million   and   $21,415 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Borrowings from the FHLB totaled   $6,700 million   and   $5,600 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  All Other Liabilities    All other liabilities was relatively flat compared with   December 31, 2015  . 
  Shareholders Equity    During the second quarter of 2016, HSBC USA redeemed all of its remaining externally issued preferred stock, including its Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series F Preferred Stock, Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series G Preferred Stock and 6.50 percent Non-Cumulative Series H Preferred Stock, totaling   $1,265 million  . In connection with these redemptions, HSBC USA issued   $1,265 million   of   6.0 percent   Non-Cumulative Series I Preferred Stock to HSBC North America. See Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," for additional details.

Net Interest Income    Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. In the discussion that follows, interest income and rates are presented and analyzed on a taxable equivalent basis to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates on a taxable equivalent basis is presented in this MD A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates." 
  The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table:  

92 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(1)   
    Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess. 
     Net interest income decreased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as the favorable impact of higher short-term market rates as discussed below was more than offset by higher interest expense from long-term debt, the impact of lower commercial loan average balances and lower interest income from trading securities. In the year-to-date period, net interest income increased as the favorable impact of higher short-term market rates and higher interest income from securities was partially offset by higher interest expense from wholesale time deposits and long-term debt as well as lower interest income from trading securities. Higher short-term market rates resulted in higher short-term investment and variable loan interest income, partially offset by higher wholesale time deposit and short-term borrowing interest expense in both the three and nine month periods while retail and commercial deposit account pricing was largely unchanged. 
  Short-term investments    Higher interest income during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due to a shift in mix towards higher yielding securities purchased under agreements to resell, higher yields on interest bearing deposits with banks driven by the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank rate increase in December 2015 and, to a lesser extent, higher average balances. 
  Trading securities    Interest income declined during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   driven primarily by increased investments in lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities. The decline was partially offset in the three month period by higher average balances overall due to increases in U.S. Treasury and foreign sovereign positions. In the year-to-date period, lower average balances overall contributed to the decline, as an increase in U.S. Treasury positions was more than offset by a decrease in foreign sovereign positions. Securities in the trading portfolio are managed as economic hedges against the derivative activity of our customers. As a result, interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below. 
  Securities    Interest income was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as higher average balances were offset by lower yields. In the year-to-date period, interest income was higher due to higher average balances driven by net purchases  
  
   93 

HSBC USA Inc. 

of U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by net sales of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities and the sale of certain foreign debt securities. 
  Commercial loans    Interest income increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher yields reflecting the impact of rate increases on variable rate products. The increase was partially offset in the three month period by lower average balances largely due to paydowns, maturities and loan sales exceeding new loan originations as we focused efforts on improving returns through disciplined lending and expanding customer relationships into other products. 
  Consumer loans    Interest income was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016, but was higher in the year-to-date period due to higher average balances driven by growth in residential mortgages. 
  Other    Lower interest income during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects lower average balances due to declines in cash collateral posted and a lower dividend rate earned on Federal Reserve Bank stock. 
  Deposits    Interest expense increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to higher rates paid on wholesale time deposits and foreign bank deposits reflecting the impact of rate increases as well as higher average interest-bearing deposit balances overall. Contributing to the increase in the year-to-date period, to a lesser extent, was higher rates paid on savings accounts driven by promotional offers to our retail customers. 
  Short-term borrowings    Higher interest expense during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was driven by higher rates paid on these borrowings, partially offset by lower average borrowings. 
  Long-term debt    Interest expense was higher during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   largely due to higher average borrowings and, in the year-to-date period, higher rates paid reflecting the impact of rate increases on variable rate borrowings and new issuances since the third quarter of 2015. 
  Tax liabilities and other    Interest expense was relatively flat during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Provision for Credit Losses    The following table summarizes the provision for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios:

    Not meaningful. 
     Our provision for credit losses increased   $15 million   and   $259 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to a higher provision for credit losses in our consumer loan portfolio and, in the year-to-date period, a higher provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we decreased our allowance for credit losses as the provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by   $3 million  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased our allowance for credit losses as the provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by   $148 million  . 
  The provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a higher provision associated with the continued deterioration of a single mining customer relationship was offset by lower provisions associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures and risk factors associated with expansion market loan exposures. In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased   $249 million   driven by higher provisions associated with the downgrade of a single mining customer relationship and, to a lesser extent, other downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships, including mining and other industry loan exposures, partially offset by lower provisions associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures and risk factors associated with expansion market loan exposures. We will continue to monitor our exposure with regard to the mining customer relationship discussed above and, as a result, further adjustments to our credit loss reserves may be required in future periods. 
  As previously discussed, during the third quarter of 2016 we transferred certain mortgages to held for sale and, as a result, recorded a lower of cost or fair value adjustment of   $11 million   related to credit factors as a component of the provision for credit losses. Excluding the impact of this item, the provision for credit losses on residential mortgages and home equity mortgages increased $6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and decreased $5 million in the year-to-date period. While the positive impacts of continued improvements in economic and credit conditions and the continued origination of higher quality Premier mortgages which are an increasingly larger portion of the portfolio were more pronounced in the year-ago quarter, they remain favorable in the year-to-date period. 
  The provision for credit losses associated with credit cards was flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the year-to-date period, the provision for credit losses associated with credit cards increased   $7 million   as the positive impacts from continued improvements in economic and credit conditions, including improvements in delinquency roll rates, were more pronounced in the prior year period. While the provision for credit losses associated with other consumer loans was flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016, it decreased $3 million in the year-to-date period as 2015 reflects a lower of cost or fair value adjustment associated with the transfer of a small student loan portfolio to held for sale. 
  Our methodology and accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are presented in our 2015 Form 10-K under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements." See "Credit Quality" in this MD A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.

     Credit card fees    Credit card fees were higher during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to lower cost estimates associated with our credit card rewards program.  
  Trust and investment management fees    Trust and investment management fees decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   driven by lower investment management fees associated with our Private Banking business reflecting a decline in assets under management.

Other fees and commissions    The following table summarizes the components of other fees and commissions: 

Other fees and commissions were higher during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to increased loan syndication and other credit facility related fees, partially offset by lower account service fees. In the year-to-date period, other fees and commissions were relatively flat as higher credit facility fees were offset by lower account service fees and lower other fee based income. 
  Trading revenue (expense)    Trading revenue (expense) is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, rates, credit, equities and precious metals markets. The following table presents trading revenue (expense) by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income related to trading activities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income. Trading revenues related to the mortgage banking business are included in residential mortgage banking revenue (expense).

    Includes derivative contracts related to credit default and cross-currency swaps, equities, interest rates and structured credit products. 
     Trading revenue (expense) increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   largely driven by the improved performance of Derivatives, Balance Sheet Management and Precious Metals, partially offset in the year-to-date period by lower revenue from Foreign Exchange. 
  Trading revenue from Derivatives improved during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   from higher new deal activity in interest rate swaps, an increase in the performance of emerging markets products and higher valuations of legacy structured credit exposures. These improvements were partially offset in both periods by the impact of debit valuation adjustments associated with movements in our own credit spreads. Derivatives trading revenue does not reflect associated net interest income as certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, were economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets. 
  Trading revenue related to Balance Sheet Management activities improved during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to the performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk. 
  Foreign Exchange trading revenue was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016, while in the year-to-date period, trading revenue declined from reduced client trade activity. 
  Precious Metals trading revenue increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to increased client trading, especially financing related trading activity. 
  Capital Financing revenue improved during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflecting lower losses related to valuation adjustments on credit default swap hedge positions.  
  Other securities gains, net    We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   $1,026 million   and   $13,697 million  , respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities compared with sales of   $1,190 million   and   $9,882 million   during the prior year periods as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes based on the current interest rate environment and liquidity needs. Other securities gains, net increased in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher gains from the sale of certain U.S. Treasury securities as we rebalanced the portfolio for risk management purposes and, in the year-to-date period, gains from the sale of certain longer term state municipal bonds as we reduced these positions during the first quarter of 2016. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities in both periods, which is included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 3, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
  Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates    Affiliate income decreased in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflecting lower fees associated with residential mortgage servicing activities performed on behalf of HSBC Finance and, to a lesser extent, lower fees related to supporting growth initiatives in the Global Liquidity and Cash Management business, partially offset by higher income from certain performance based trading activity booked on the balance sheets of other HSBC affiliates.

Residential mortgage banking revenue (expense)    The following table presents the components of residential mortgage banking revenue (expense). Net interest income related to residential mortgage banking is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income. 

* 
    Not meaningful. 
     Total residential mortgage banking revenue (expense) decreased in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to lower net hedged MSRs results, lower servicing fees resulting from the planned run-off of our average serviced portfolio and lower recoveries for repurchase obligations associated with loans previously sold. As a result of our strategic relationship with PHH Mortgage, we do not add new volume to our serviced portfolio as all agency eligible loans are sold to PHH Mortgage on a servicing released basis. Net hedged MSRs results were lower in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   largely reflecting the impact of entering into an agreement to sell our remaining MSRs portfolio in August 2016. We expect the sale to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives    We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, certain own fixed-rate debt issuances and all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain financial instruments for which fair value option  
  
   99 

HSBC USA Inc. 

accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   attributable primarily to movements in credit spreads associated with our own debt and structured notes and deposits. This decrease was partially offset in the year-to-date period by the non-recurrence of a net loss recorded in 2015 related to changes in estimates associated with the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of certain structured notes and deposits. See Note 11, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component. 
  Other income (loss)    Other income (loss) decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to losses in the current year periods associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a single client exposure compared with gains in the prior year periods, higher losses from valuation write-downs on loans held for sale and, in the year-to-date period, higher losses associated with fair value hedge ineffectiveness.

Salaries and employee benefits    Salaries and employee benefits were lower during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. Despite a decline in the average number of personnel driven by continued cost management efforts including targeted staff reductions across all of our businesses to optimize staffing and improve efficiency as well as a reduction in staff performing residential mortgage servicing activities on behalf of HSBC Finance, the impact of these decreases were largely offset by the addition of higher cost personnel associated with growth initiatives in certain businesses, strengthening controls and the implementation of the highest and most effective global standards in combating financial crime. 
  Support services from HSBC affiliates    Support services from HSBC affiliates were relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as the favorable impact of cost management efforts were largely offset by higher expense associated with certain performance based trading activity booked on our balance sheet by other HSBC affiliates. In the year-to-date period, support services from HSBC affiliates decreased due primarily to the favorable impact of cost management efforts including staff optimization in our technology and corporate support service functions and lower costs associated with business systems reflecting the completion of certain projects. A summary of the activities charged to us from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 14, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
  Occupancy expense, net    Occupancy expense was flat during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Other expenses    Other expenses increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflecting higher deposit insurance assessment fees, the non-recurrence of a benefit recorded in the prior year periods associated with a settlement of certain compensatory fee exposures, higher outside services expense and, in the year-to-date period, higher off-balance sheet credit reserves due to downgrades. These increases were partially offset by lower litigation expense, lower losses associated with card fraud and lower marketing and travel expenses. 
  Efficiency ratio    Our efficiency ratio was   86.9 percent   and   79.2 percent   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   68.5 percent   and   74.3 percent   during the prior year periods. Our efficiency ratio was impacted in each period by the change in the fair value of our own debt attributable to credit spread for which we have elected fair value option accounting which is reported as a component of total other revenues in our consolidated statement of income. Excluding the impact of this item, our efficiency ratio remained higher during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to lower other revenues. In the year-to-date period, lower other revenues were partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher net interest income. 
  Income taxes    The following table provides an analysis of the difference between effective rates based on the total income tax provision attributable to pretax income and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate: 

102 

HSBC USA Inc. 

(1)   
    For 2015, the amount mainly relates to the effects of revaluing our deferred tax assets for New York City Tax Reform that was enacted on April 13, 2015 which resulted in a decrease to our net deferred tax asset of approximately $48 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
     In April 2016, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations intended to discourage corporate inversions by re-characterizing certain intercompany debt as equity, effectively eliminating the tax deduction for interest paid to related parties under certain circumstances. Final and temporary regulations were released in October 2016 that exempt regulated financial groups such as HSBC and its affiliates from those re-characterization rules. Certain documentation rules included in the regulations will apply to HSBC and its affiliates, and we will analyze the requirements in order to implement on a timely basis in accordance with the rules. We do not anticipate a significant financial accounting impact upon implementation of the regulations. 

Segment Results   Group Reporting Basis 

We have four distinct business segments that are utilized for management reporting and analysis purposes which are aligned with HSBC's global businesses and business strategy: Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM"), Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GB M") and Private Banking ("PB"). The segments, which are generally based upon customer groupings and global businesses, are described under Item 1,  Business,  in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
  We previously announced that with effect from January 1, 2016, a portion of our Business Banking client group, generally representing those small business customers with   $3 million   or less in annual revenue (now referred to as Retail Business Banking), would be better managed as part of RBWM rather than CMB given the similarities in their banking activities with the RBWM customer base. Therefore, to coincide with the change in our management reporting effective beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we have included the results of Retail Business Banking in the RBWM segment for all periods presented. As a result, loss before tax for the RBWM segment increased   $9 million   and   $25 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. There have been no other changes in the basis of our segmentation or measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  During the first half of 2016, we determined that a portion of our Large Corporate client group, generally representing those large business customers with more complex banking activities which require the levels of support routinely provided by relationship managers in GB M, would be better managed as part of GB M rather than CMB, effective October 1, 2016. Therefore, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we will include the results of the transferred client relationships in the GB M segment for all periods presented. We currently expect this transfer will result in an increase to loans and deposits for the GB M segment of approximately   $3.4 billion   and   $2.4 billion  , respectively. The profit before tax associated with these relationships was approximately   $83 million   and   $54 million   during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
  We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRS issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU, and, as a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis") as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. However, we continue to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis. The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 22, "Business Segments," and under the caption "Basis of Reporting" in the MD A section of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  We continue to review the financial information used to manage our businesses, including the scope and content of the financial data, including the U.S. GAAP financial data, being reported to our Management and our Board. To the extent we make changes to this reporting in the future, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have on our segment reporting. 
  Retail Banking and Wealth Management    RBWM provides banking and wealth management services for our personal customers, focusing on internationally minded clients in large metropolitan centers on the West and East coasts. 
  During the first nine months of 2016, we continued to direct resources towards the development and delivery of premium service. Particular focus has been placed on HSBC Premier, HSBC's global banking service which offers customers a seamless international service, and HSBC Advance, a proposition directed towards the emerging affluent client in the initial stages of wealth accumulation. 
  Consistent with our strategy, the growth of our residential mortgage portfolio is driven primarily by lending to our Premier and Advance customers. Following the conversion of our mortgage processing and servicing operations to PHH Mortgage in 2013, we sell our agency eligible originations directly to PHH Mortgage on a servicing released basis, resulting in no new mortgage servicing rights being recognized. In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our remaining MSRs portfolio and expect the sale to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016.

    Other primarily includes fees associated with residential mortgage servicing activities performed on behalf of HSBC Finance and revenue associated with certain residential mortgage loans that we previously purchased from HSBC Finance. 
     Our RBWM segment reported a higher loss before tax during the three months ended September 30, 2016 driven primarily by lower other operating income and higher loan impairment charges, partially offset by higher net interest income. In the year-to-date period, loss before tax improved reflecting higher net interest income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower other operating income. 
  Net interest income increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   largely driven by higher net interest income from deposits due to higher average balances and improved spreads, partially offset by lower net interest income from

lending. Net interest income from lending declined as the favorable impact of growth in residential mortgage average balances was more than offset by a declining home equity mortgage portfolio and lower spreads. 
  Other operating income decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due largely to lower servicing fees resulting from the planned run-off of our average serviced portfolio, a lower recovery for repurchase obligations associated with loans previously sold, lower fees associated with residential mortgage servicing activities performed on behalf of HSBC Finance and reduced asset management fees driven by a decline in assets under management principally in our emerging market bond funds. These decreases were partially offset by higher net hedged MSRs results. 
  Loan impairment charges were higher during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and flat in the year-to-date period. While the positive impacts of continued improvements in economic and credit conditions and the continued origination of higher quality Premier mortgages which are an increasingly larger portion of the portfolio were more pronounced in the year-ago quarter, they were flat in the year-to-date period as lower loss estimates for residential mortgages were offset by higher loss estimates for credit cards. 
  Operating expenses were relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and decreased in the year-to-date period reflecting lower litigation expense and the impact of continued cost management efforts including targeted staff reductions to optimize staffing and improve efficiency. These decreases were offset in the three month period and partially offset in the year-to-date period by the non-recurrence of a benefit recorded in the prior year periods associated with a settlement of certain compensatory fee exposures. 
  Commercial Banking    CMB offers a full range of commercial financial services and tailored solutions to enable customers to grow their businesses, focusing on key markets with high concentrations of international connectivity.  
  Total quarter-to-date average loans outstanding, including loans held for sale, decreased 9 percent across all CMB client groups as compared with the third quarter of 2015 as we focused efforts on improving returns through disciplined lending and expanding customer relationships into other products. In addition, total quarter-to-date average deposits outstanding increased 8 percent across all CMB client groups as compared with the third quarter of 2015 which reflects executing a key strategy to grow the Global Liquidity and Cash Management business through our international network.

    The following table summarizes the impact of key activities on the total operating income of the CMB segment: 

Our CMB segment reported a higher profit before tax during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to lower loan impairment charges and, in the year-to-date period, higher net interest income, partially offset by lower other operating income.  
  Net interest income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower loan balances in Lending and Transaction Management and higher funding costs. This decrease was partially offset in the three month period and more than offset in the year-to-date period by the favorable impacts of growth in deposit balances in Global Liquidity and Cash Management as well as interest rate increases in December 2015 resulting in improved spreads on both deposits and loans. 
  Other operating income was lower during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to lower fee based income reflecting a slowdown in commercial lending activity compared with the prior year periods. 
  Loan impairment charges were lower during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to lower provisions for oil and gas industry loan exposures and risk factors associated with expansion market loan exposures. These decreases were partially offset in the year-to-date period by higher loss estimates associated with downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships. 
  Operating expenses were relatively flat during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   as the impact of cost management efforts including targeted staff reductions to optimize staffing and improve efficiency were largely offset by higher deposit insurance assessment fees. 
  Global Banking and Markets    GB M provides tailored financial solutions to major government, corporate and institutional clients worldwide.  
  We continue to target U.S. companies with international banking requirements and foreign companies with banking needs in the Americas. Consistent with our global strategy, we are also focused on identifying opportunities to cross-sell our products to CMB and RBWM customers.

    Credit includes gains of $22 million and $20 million in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with losses of $11 million and $9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, of operating income related to structured credit products and mortgage loans held for sale which we no longer offer. 
               (3)   
    Balance Sheet Management includes gains on the sale of securities of $16 million and $78 million in   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with gains of $11 million and $69 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
               (4)   
    Other includes corporate funding charges, net interest income on capital held in the business and not assigned to products, and interest rate transfer pricing differences. 
     Our GB M segment reported lower profit before tax during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   driven by lower other operating income and higher loan impairment charges, partially offset by higher net interest income and lower operating expenses.  
  Credit revenue improved during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher revenue from collateralized financing related activity and higher valuations of legacy structured credit exposures. Changes in the fair value of legacy structured credit products resulted in gains of $22 million and $20 million during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with losses of $11 million and $9 million during the prior year periods. Included in the changes in fair value from structured credit products were increases in fair value of $12 million and $25 million during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to exposures to monoline insurance companies, compared with increases of $12 million and $7 million during the prior year periods. 
  Revenue from Rates improved during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   from higher new deal activity in interest rate swaps and, in the year-to-date period, the non-recurrence of a loss recorded in 2015 related to changes in estimates associated with the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of certain rate linked structured notes. These improvements  
  
   108 

HSBC USA Inc. 

in both periods were partially offset by the impact of fair value adjustments on certain rate linked structured notes related to movements in our own credit spreads. 
  Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to increased Precious Metals client trading activity, especially financing related trading activity. 
  The decrease in Equities during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due primarily to fair value adjustments on certain equity linked structured liabilities, including the impact of movements in our own credit spreads and, in the year-to-date period, the non-recurrence of a gain recorded in 2015 related to changes in estimates associated with the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of these liabilities. 
  Capital Financing revenue decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to losses in the current year periods associated with credit default swap protection which largely reflects the hedging of a single client exposure compared with gains in the prior year periods, partially offset by higher net interest income driven by improved loan spreads. While event financing fees were higher and partially offset the decrease in the three month period, they were lower in the year-to-date period. 
  Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   driven by higher net interest income from the benefit of higher deposit balances, partially offset by decreased fee income due to lower volumes. 
  Balance Sheet Management revenue was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the year-to-date period, Balance Sheet Management revenue declined due to higher losses related to the performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk, partially offset by higher interest income driven by higher yielding investments, higher gains from asset sales and higher income related to bank owned life insurance. 
  Debit valuation adjustments resulted in lower revenue during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior year periods driven by movements of both our own credit spreads and our derivative liability balances. 
  Loan impairment charges were higher during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due largely to higher loss estimates associated with a single mining customer relationship and, in the year-to-date period, higher loss estimates associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures as well as other downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships, including mining and other industry loan exposures. Higher loss estimates associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures were driven primarily by the downgrade of a large customer relationship and the establishment of specific reserves related to two large loans which became impaired. 
  Operating expenses were lower during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due primarily to lower corporate function cost allocations from affiliates. 
  Private Banking    PB serves high net worth individuals and families with complex needs domestically and abroad. 
  Client deposit levels increased $72 million or 1 percent as compared with   September 30, 2015  . Total loans decreased $248 million or 4 percent as compared with   September 30, 2015  , primarily in the commercial portfolio. Overall period end client assets were $1,637 million lower than   September 30, 2015   as increased client deposits levels were more than offset by lower discretionary and fiduciary portfolios which were negatively impacted by client outflows.

     Our PB segment profit before tax increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to higher net interest income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower other operating income. In the year-to-date period, profit before tax was relatively flat as lower other operating income was largely offset by higher net interest income and lower operating expenses. 
  Net interest income increased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   driven by improved spreads due to market rates and the favorable impact of higher deposit balances. 
  Other operating income decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to lower fees and commissions reflecting a decline in managed and investment product balances. 
  Loan impairment charges (recoveries) were relatively flat during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Operating expenses decreased during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflecting lower litigation expense and lower corporate function cost allocations from affiliates. 
  Other    The other segment primarily includes changes in the fair value of certain debt issued for which fair value option accounting was elected and related derivatives, income and expense associated with certain affiliate transactions, certain corporate function costs including costs to achieve, adjustments to the fair value of HSBC shares held for stock plans, interest expense associated with certain tax exposures and income associated with other tax related investments.

     Our Other segment reported loss before tax during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with profit before tax during the prior year periods primarily due to lower operating income from changes in the fair value of our own debt and related derivatives for which fair value option accounting was elected as well as higher operating expenses driven by higher costs to achieve charges. 
  Reconciliation of Segment Results    As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. For segment reporting purposes, inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for transactions between segments as if they were with third parties. See Note 15, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals. 

Credit Quality                 

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the U.S. and, on a limited basis, internationally. 
  Allowance for Credit Losses    Commercial loans are monitored on a continuous basis with a formal assessment completed, at a minimum, annually. As part of this process, a credit grade and loss given default are assigned and an allowance is established for these loans based on a probability of default estimate associated with each credit grade under the allowance for credit losses methodology. Credit Review, a function independent of the business, provides an ongoing assessment of lending activities that includes independently assessing credit grades and loss given default estimates for sampled credits across various portfolios. When it is deemed probable based upon known facts and circumstances that full interest and principal on an individual loan will not be collected in accordance with its contractual terms, the loan is considered impaired. An impairment reserve is then established based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Updated appraisals for collateral dependent loans are generally obtained only when such loans are considered troubled and the frequency of such updates  
  
   111 

HSBC USA Inc. 

are generally based on management judgment under the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis. In addition, loss reserves on commercial loans are maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors which may not be fully reflected in the reserve calculations. 
  Our probability of default estimates for commercial loans are mapped to our credit grade master scale. These probability of default estimates are validated on an annual basis using back-testing of actual default rates and benchmarking of the internal ratings with external rating agency data like Standard and Poor's ("S P") ratings and default rates. Substantially all appraisals in connection with commercial real estate loans are ordered by the independent real estate appraisal review unit at HSBC. The appraisal must be reviewed and accepted by this unit. For loans greater than $250,000, an appraisal is generally ordered when the loan is classified as Substandard as defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). On average, it takes approximately four weeks from the time the appraisal is ordered until it is completed and the values accepted by HSBC's independent appraisal review unit. Subsequent provisions or charge-offs are completed shortly thereafter, generally within the quarter in which the appraisal is received.  
  In situations where an external appraisal is not used to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral of impaired loans, current information such as rent rolls and operating statements of the subject property are reviewed and presented in a standardized format. Operating results such as net operating income and cash flows before and after debt service are established and reported with relevant ratios. Third-party market data is gathered and reviewed for relevance to the subject collateral. Data is also collected from similar properties within the portfolio. Actual sales levels of properties, operating income and expense figures and rental data on a square foot basis are derived from existing loans and, when appropriate, used as comparables for the subject property. Property specific data, augmented by market data research, is used to project a stabilized year of income and expense to create a 10-year cash flow model to be discounted at appropriate rates to present value. These valuations are then used to determine if any impairment on the underlying loans exists and an appropriate allowance is recorded when warranted.  
  For loans identified as troubled debt restructurings ("TDR loans"), an allowance for credit losses is maintained based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans' original effective interest rate or in the case of certain loans which are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The circumstances in which we perform a loan modification involving a TDR Loan at a then current market interest rate for a borrower with similar credit risk would include other changes to the terms of the original loan made as part of the restructuring (e.g. principal reductions, collateral changes, etc.) in order for the loan to be classified as a TDR Loan. 
  For pools of homogeneous consumer receivables and certain small business loans which do not qualify as TDR Loans, we estimate probable losses using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency, or buckets, and ultimately charge-off     based upon recent historical performance experience of other loans in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporates estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. This analysis considers delinquency status, loss experience and severity and takes into account whether borrowers have filed for bankruptcy or have been subject to account management actions, such as the re-age or modification of accounts. We also take into consideration the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the loan in the event of default based on historical and recent trends which are updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months' data using the most recently available information.   
     The roll rate methodology is a migration analysis based on contractual delinquency and rolling average historical loss experience which captures the increased likelihood of an account migrating to charge-off as the past due status of such account increases. The roll rate models used were developed by tracking the movement of delinquencies by age of delinquency by "bucket" over a specified time period. Each bucket represents a period of delinquency in 30-day increments. The roll from the last delinquency bucket results in charge-off. Contractual delinquency is a method for determining aging of past due accounts based on the status of payments under the loan. Average roll rates are developed to avoid temporary aberrations caused by seasonal trends in delinquency experienced by some product types. We have determined that a 12-month average roll rate balances the desire to avoid temporary aberrations, while at the same time analyzing recent historical data. The roll rate calculations are performed monthly and are done consistently from period to period. We regularly monitor our portfolio to evaluate the period of time utilized in our roll rate migration analysis and perform a formal review on an annual basis. In addition, loss reserves on consumer receivables are maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors which may not be fully reflected in the statistical roll rate calculation. 
  Our allowance for credit losses methodology and our accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are presented in further detail under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2015 Form 10-K. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no significant revisions to our policies or methodologies during the first nine months of 2016.

The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated: 

(1)   
    Ratios exclude loans held for sale as these loans are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 
                (3)   
    Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for the year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was 61 months, 48 months and 146 months, respectively. The net charge-off coverage ratio represents the commercial allowance for credit losses at period end divided by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during the period. 
               (4)   
    Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more. 
     See Note 5, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit losses by general loan categories for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The allowance for credit losses at   September 30, 2016   was relatively flat as compared with   June 30, 2016   as higher loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio were offset by lower loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio. As compared with   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for credit losses   increased     $148 million   or   16 percent   due to higher loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by lower loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio.  
  Our commercial allowance for credit losses   increased     $18 million   or   2 percent   as compared with   June 30, 2016   and   increased     $192 million   or   25 percent   as compared with   December 31, 2015   primarily due to higher loss estimates associated with the continued deterioration of a single mining customer relationship and, as compared with December 31, 2016, other downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships, including mining and other industry loan exposures. These increases in both periods were partially offset by charge-offs associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures, including a large impaired oil and gas industry loan that was sold during the second quarter of 2016, as well as lower loss estimates for risk factors associated with expansion market loan exposures. 
  Our consumer allowance for credit losses   decreased     $21 million   or   19 percent   as compared with   June 30, 2016   and   decreased     $44 million   or   33 percent   as compared with   December 31, 2015   primarily due to charge-offs associated with the transfers of certain mortgages to held for sale and, as compared with December 31, 2016, continued improvements in economic and credit conditions  
  
   113 

HSBC USA Inc. 

and the continued origination of higher quality Premier mortgages which are an increasingly larger portion of the portfolio. The year-to-date period also reflects releases of reserves related to certain residential mortgages serviced by others as a result of updated information regarding the underlying loan characteristics being reported by the servicers and improved loss estimates associated with certain home equity mortgages. 
  Our residential mortgage loan allowance for credit losses in all periods reflects consideration of certain risk factors relating to trends such as recent portfolio performance as compared with average roll rates and economic uncertainty, including housing market trends as well as second lien exposure. 
  The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans at   September 30, 2016   increased as compared with both   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   due to an increase in the commercial loan percentage, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer loan percentage for the reasons discussed above. 
  The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs was relatively flat as compared with   June 30, 2016   as higher dollars of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by the transfer of certain mortgages to held for sale were offset by lower dollars of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio. Lower dollars of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio reflects the non-recurrence of a charge-off recorded during the second quarter of 2016 related to the sale of a large impaired oil and gas industry loan, partially offset by higher charge-offs associated with other oil and gas industry loan exposures. As compared with   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net charge-offs decreased due to higher dollars of net charge-offs in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. 
  The following table presents the allowance for credit losses by major loan categories, excluding loans held for sale:   

(1)   
    See Note 5, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for components of the commercial allowance for credit losses. 
     Reserves for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk    We also maintain a separate reserve for credit risk associated with certain commercial off-balance sheet exposures, including letters of credit, unused commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees. The following table summarizes this reserve, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The related provision is recorded as a component of other expense within operating expenses.  

The increase in off-balance sheet reserves at September 30, 2016 as compared with   December 31, 2015   reflects the impact of downgrades during the first nine months of 2016. Off-balance sheet exposures are summarized under the caption "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations" in this MD A.

Delinquency    The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percent of total loans and loans held for sale ("delinquency ratio"): 

(2)   The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans:   

  Compared with   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 10 basis points and   1   basis point, respectively, as higher dollars of delinquency in our commercial loan portfolio was partially offset compared with   June 30, 2016  , and largely offset compared with   December 31, 2015  , by lower dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio and lower outstanding loan balances primarily in our commercial loan portfolio.  
  Compared with   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our commercial two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 14 basis points and   7   basis points, respectively, largely due to a single mining industry exposure which became greater than 60 days delinquent during the third quarter and lower outstanding loan balances, partially offset by the sale of an impaired real estate exposure and, in the year-to-date period, the charge-off of certain business and corporate banking loans and improved collections.  
  Our consumer loan two-month-and-over contractual delinquency ratio decreased 11 basis points and   47   basis points from   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, due to lower levels of residential mortgage loan delinquency driven by continued improvements in economic and credit conditions and the continued origination of higher quality Premier mortgages which are an increasingly larger portion of the portfolio. Home equity mortgage loan delinquency was also lower due to improved collections. Residential mortgage loan delinquency levels however continue to be impacted by an elongated foreclosure process which has  
  
   115 

HSBC USA Inc. 

resulted in loans which would otherwise have been foreclosed and transferred to Real Estate Owned remaining in the loan account and, consequently, in delinquency. 
  Residential mortgage delinquency is higher than home equity mortgage delinquency in all periods largely due to the inventory of loans which are held at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and are in the foreclosure process. Given the extended foreclosure time lines, particularly in those states where HUSI has a large footprint, the residential mortgage portfolio has a substantial inventory of loans which are greater than 180 days past due and have been written down to the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. There is a substantially lower volume of home equity mortgage loans where we pursue foreclosure less frequently given the generally subordinate position of the lien. In addition, our legacy business, originated through broker channels and loan transfers from HSBC Finance, is of a lower credit quality and, therefore, contributes to an overall higher weighted average delinquency rate for our residential mortgages. Both of these factors are expected to continue to diminish in future periods as the foreclosure backlog resulting from extended foreclosure time lines is managed down and the portfolio mix continues to shift to higher quality loans as the legacy broker originated business and prior loan transfers run off or sell.   
  Net Charge-offs of Loans    The following table summarizes net charge-off (recovery) dollars as well as the net charge-off (recovery) of loans for the quarter, annualized, as a percentage of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, ("net charge-off ratio"):  

Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased 14 basis points compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to lower levels of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the non-recurrence of a charge-off recorded during the second quarter of 2016 related to the sale of a large impaired oil and gas industry loan which was partially offset by higher charge-offs associated with other oil and gas industry loan exposures and higher levels of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by the transfer of certain mortgages to held for sale.  
  Compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 25 basis points reflecting higher dollars of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by the transfer of certain mortgages to held for sale and in our commercial loan portfolio due to higher charge-offs associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures.

Nonperforming Assets    Nonperforming assets consisted of the following:    

(2)   
    Nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all receivables which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. 
               (3)   
    Nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans are predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio.  
               (4)   
    The trend in nonaccrual loans reflects the impact of transfers of certain residential mortgage loans to held for sale during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
      Nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016   decreased as compared with   June 30, 2016   driven by lower levels of commercial nonaccrual loans largely due to the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry relationship, the sale of an impaired real estate exposure, the paydown of a business banking loan and the impact of charge-offs of certain oil and gas industry loan exposures. These decreases were partially offset by downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships. As compared with   December 31, 2015  , nonaccrual loans increased due to higher levels of commercial nonaccrual loans due to the downgrade of a single mining customer relationship as well as other downgrades reflecting weaknesses in the financial condition of certain customer relationships, predominantly oil and gas, and mining industry related. Our consumer nonaccrual loans decreased slightly compared with both   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   reflecting the impact of continued improvements in economic and credit conditions. Residential mortgage nonaccrual loan levels continue to be impacted by an elongated foreclosure process as previously discussed. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more remained flat compared with both   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in our 2015 Form 10-K.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Impaired Commercial Loans    See Note 4, "Loans," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding impaired loans, including TDR Loans, as well as certain other commercial credit quality indicators. Commercial impaired loans increased as compared with   December 31, 2015   largely due to higher nonaccrual loans for the reasons discussed above and, to a lesser extent, higher TDR Loans reflecting the restructuring of certain customer relationships. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk    A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and internationally. In general, we manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies. These policies and procedures provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management s credit evaluation. As with any nonconforming and non-prime loan products, we utilize high underwriting standards and price these loans in a manner that is appropriate to compensate for higher risk. We do not offer teaser rate mortgage loans. 
  Our loan portfolio includes the following types of loans: 
             
    Interest-only loans   A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period.  
                
    Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans   A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements.  
     The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios, including certain loans held for sale, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below. 

The following table summarizes the concentrations of first and second liens within the outstanding residential mortgage and home equity mortgage portfolios. Amounts in the table exclude residential mortgage loans held for sale of   $971 million   and   $11 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and home equity mortgage loans held for sale of   $4 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 

(1)   
    A majority of revolving are second lien mortgages.

Geographic Concentrations   The following table reflects regional exposure at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for our real estate secured loan portfolios: 

Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts    Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. 
  The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as: 
             
    volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments; 
                
    current market events or trends; 
                
    country risk; 
                
    maturity and liquidity of contracts; 
                
    credit worthiness of the counterparties in the transaction; 
                
    the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and 
                
    existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures. 
     The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the Basel III Standardized Approach regulatory capital rules published by U.S. banking regulatory agencies which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk weighted assets when netting requirements have been met. As a result, risk weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. 
  
   119 

HSBC USA Inc. 

The total credit risk exposure presented in the table below potentially overstates actual credit exposure because it ignores collateral that may have been received from counterparties to secure exposures; and the regulatory capital rules compute exposures over the life of derivative contracts. However, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. 
  During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , marketplace liquidity continued to remain available for most sources of funding. The prolonged period of low interest rates continues to put pressure on spreads earned on our deposit base. 
  In December 2015, HSBC submitted its full resolution plan to the FRB and the FDIC as required under the Dodd-Frank Act (the Systemically Important Financial Institution Plan or "SIFI Plan") and HSBC Bank USA submitted its full resolution plan as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the Insured Depository Institution Plan or "IDI Plan"). As of the date of this report, HSBC had not received formal feedback on the 2015 plans from the agencies. During the third quarter of 2016, the next annual submission date for both the HSBC SIFI Plan and the HSBC Bank USA IDI Plan were extended to December 31, 2017. 
  As previously reported, as a result of the adoption of the final rules by the U.S. banking regulators implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("Basel Committee"), together with the impact of similar implementation by United Kingdom banking regulators, we continue to review the composition of our capital structure. As discussed below, during the second quarter of 2016, we replaced certain preferred equity instruments that receive less favorable treatment under the rules with new Basel III compliant instruments. 
  Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks   totaled   $17,139 million   and   $7,478 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which $16,514 million and $6,708 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns. 
  Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell   totaled   $30,714 million   and   $19,847 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. 
  Trading Assets   includes securities totaling   $13,243 million   and   $11,155 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 
  Securities   includes securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity totaling   $54,231 million   and   $49,797 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD A for further analysis and discussion on trends. 
  Short-Term Borrowings   totaled   $6,062 million   and   $4,995 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD A for further analysis and discussion on short-term borrowing trends.

Deposits   totaled   $131,082 million   and   $118,579 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which included   $101,452 million   and   $90,463 million  , respectively, of core deposits as calculated in accordance with FFIEC guidelines. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD A for further analysis and discussion on deposit trends. 
  Long-Term Debt     increased   to   $39,500 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $33,509 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The following table presents the maturities of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  :

See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD A for further analysis and discussion on long-term debt trends, including additional information on debt issued and repaid during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. The shelf has no dollar limit, but the amount of debt outstanding is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. At   September 30, 2016  , we were authorized to issue up to   $36,000 million  , of which   $14,033 million   was available. HSBC Bank USA has a   $40,000 million   Global Bank Note Program of which   $15,736 million   was available at   September 30, 2016  . 
  As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At   September 30, 2016  , long-term debt included   $6,700 million   of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we were allowed access to further overnight borrowings of up to   $8,922 million  . 
  Preferred Equity    During the second quarter of 2016, HSBC USA redeemed all of its remaining externally issued preferred stock, including its Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series F Preferred Stock, Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Series G Preferred Stock and 6.50 percent Non-Cumulative Series H Preferred Stock, totaling   $1,265 million  . In connection with these redemptions, HSBC USA issued   $1,265 million   of   6.0 percent   Non-Cumulative Series I Preferred Stock to HSBC North America. See Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," for additional details. 
  Common Equity    During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not receive any cash capital contributions from HSBC North America Inc. and we did not make any capital contributions to our subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. 
  Selected Capital Ratios    Capital amounts and ratios are calculated in accordance with banking regulations in effect at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, total capital to risk weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (this latter ratio, also known as the "Tier 1 leverage ratio"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes selected capital ratios for HSBC USA:

HSBC USA Inc. 

HSBC USA manages capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our initial approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient or unavailable, we will rely on capital support from our parent in accordance with HSBC's capital management policy. HSBC has indicated that they are fully committed and have the capacity to provide capital as needed to run operations and maintain sufficient regulatory capital ratios.  
  Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk weighted assets, also calculated based on regulatory definitions. Economic Capital is a proprietary measure to estimate unexpected loss at the 99.95 percent confidence level over a 1-year time horizon. Economic Capital is compared to a calculation of available capital resources to assess capital adequacy as part of the ICAAP. 
  In 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States which, for banking organizations such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, became effective in 2014 with certain provisions being phased in over time through the beginning of 2019. The Basel III final rule established an integrated regulatory capital framework to improve the quality and quantity of regulatory capital. As a result, the capital ratios in the table above are reported in accordance with the Basel III transition rules within the final rule. The Basel III final rule also introduced a supplementary leverage ratio ("SLR") with full implementation and compliance required by January 1, 2018. For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including fully phased in required minimum risk-based capital ratios and the SLR, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  In 2014, the FRB adopted a final rule requiring enhanced supervision of the U.S. operations of non-U.S. banks such as HSBC. The rule requires certain large non-U.S. banks with significant operations in the United States, such as HSBC, to establish a single IHC to hold all of their U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The HSBC Group currently operates in the United States through such an IHC structure (i.e., HSBC North America), and therefore, the implementation of this requirement did not have a significant impact on our U.S. operations. As previously disclosed, in accordance with the final rule HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA received regulatory approval in 2015 to opt out of the "Advanced Approaches" (which include an advanced internal ratings based approach for credit risk and an advanced measurement approach for operational risk) and are calculating their risk-based and leverage capital requirements solely under the general risk-based capital rules of the Standardized Approach. In March 2016, HSBC Bank USA submitted a request to the OCC to renew the opt out. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, however, remain subject to the other capital requirements applicable to Advanced Approaches banking organizations such as: the SLR, the countercyclical capital buffer, stress testing requirements, enhanced risk management standards, enhanced governance and stress testing requirements for liquidity management, and other applicable prudential standards. Under the final rule, most of these requirements became effective July 1, 2016. 
  In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board issued its final standards for TLAC requirements for G-SIBs. In October 2015, the FRB issued its proposal to impose TLAC requirements on U.S. G-SIBs and the U.S. IHCs owned by non-U.S. G-SIBs ( TLAC Proposal ). The TLAC Proposal represents an extension of the current regulatory capital framework, which is aimed at ensuring that a banking organization can absorb losses without falling into resolution. The TLAC Proposal would require the U.S. IHCs of G-SIBs ( Covered IHCs ), including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of internal TLAC, which would include minimum levels of TLAC and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019. Additionally, the TLAC Proposal would include  clean holding company" requirements that impose stringent limitations on the ability of Covered IHCs to incur common types of non-TLAC-related liabilities. The FRB requested comments on all aspects of the proposal by February 19, 2016. We provided a comment letter to the FRB in February and a supplementary letter in June. 
  Capital Planning and Stress Testing    U.S. bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including HSBC North America, are required to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and the semi-annual company-run stress tests as required under DFAST. Under the rules, the FRB evaluates bank holding companies annually on their capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment process and plans for capital distributions, and will provide a non-objection in relation to capital distributions only for companies that can demonstrate sufficient capital strength after making the capital distributions. HSBC North America participates in the CCAR and DFAST programs of the FRB and submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and annual company-run DFAST results in April 2016. HSBC Bank USA is subject to the OCC's DFAST requirements, which require certain banks to conduct annual company-run stress tests, and submitted its latest annual DFAST results in April 2016, and its latest semi-annual DFAST results in October 2016. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and the OCC for the annual exercise, and internally developed scenarios for both the annual and mid-cycle exercises, on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bank-holding company or bank over a nine quarter planning horizon. 
  HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are required to disclose the results of their annual DFAST under the FRB and OCC s severely adverse stress scenario and HSBC North America is required to disclose the results of its mid-cycle DFAST under its  
  
   122 

HSBC USA Inc. 

internally developed severely adverse stress scenario. In July 2016, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA publicly disclosed their most recent annual DFAST results and the FRB also publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results. In October 2016, HSBC North America publicly disclosed the results of its mid-cycle DFAST results. 
  In June 2016, the FRB informed HSBC North America, our indirect parent company, that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2016 CCAR submission. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity. 
  HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA are required to meet minimum capital requirements by our principal regulators. Risk-based capital amounts and ratios are presented in Note 16, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
  2016 Funding Strategy    Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2016 are summarized in the following table: 

The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. Our prospects for growth continue to be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain deposits and, to a lesser extent, access to the global capital markets. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We will continue to sell a portion of new mortgage loan originations to PHH Mortgage. 
  HSBC Finance relies on its affiliates, including HSBC USA, to satisfy its funding needs which are not met by cash generated from its loan sales and operations. 
  HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other "covered transactions" with HSBC USA and other affiliates. Covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, and certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. A bank's credit exposure to an affiliate as a result of a derivative, securities lending/borrowing or repurchase transaction is also subject to these restrictions. A bank's transactions with its non-bank affiliates are also required to be on arm's length terms. Certain Edge Act subsidiaries of HSBC Bank USA are limited in the amount of funds they can provide to other affiliates including their parent. Amounts above their level of invested capital have to be secured with U.S. government securities. 
  For further discussion relating to our sources of liquidity and contingency funding plan, see the caption "Risk Management" in this MD A.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations 

As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees.  
  As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee.  
  The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements.     

Other Commitments to Extend Credit    Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Consumer commitments are comprised of certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit and certain asset purchase commitments.  
  In connection with our commercial lending activities, prior to the third quarter of 2016, we provided liquidity support to Regency Assets Limited ("Regency"), a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper ("ABCP") conduit consolidated by an HSBC affiliate. The liquidity support we provided to Regency was in the form of lines of credit or asset purchase agreements. Under the terms of these liquidity agreements, Regency could have called upon us to lend money or to purchase certain assets in the event Regency was unable or unwilling to issue or rollover maturing commercial paper. At December 31, 2015, we had issued   $3,362 million   of liquidity facilities to provide liquidity support to Regency. We received fees for providing these liquidity facilities. Credit risk on these obligations was managed by subjecting them to our normal underwriting and risk management processes. During the third quarter of 2016, Regency was restructured and these liquidity facilities were terminated. See Note 17, "Variable Interest Entities, for additional discussion. 
  We also previously provided credit facilities to certain Canadian multi-seller ABCP conduits that had been subject to restructuring agreements as part of the Montreal Accord. As part of the enhanced collateral pool established for the restructuring, we provided a Margin Funding Facility to a Master Asset Vehicle which was undrawn. The undrawn facility totaled CAD $77 million at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In October 2016, this facility was terminated. 
  In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and  
  
   124 

HSBC USA Inc. 

consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets. 

Fair Value 

Fair value measurement accounting principles require a reporting entity to take into consideration its own credit risk in determining the fair value of financial liabilities. The incorporation of our own credit risk accounted for   an increase   of   $60 million   and   a decrease   of   $94 million   in the fair value of financial liabilities during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   a decrease   of   $157 million   and   a decrease   of   $232 million   during the prior year periods.  
  Net income volatility arising from changes in either interest rate or credit components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives affects the comparability of reported results between periods. Accordingly, the gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period.  
  Control Over Valuation Process and Procedures    We have established a control framework which is designed to ensure that fair values are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details on our valuation control framework.  
  Fair Value Hierarchy    Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy: 
             
    whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price; 
                
    the level of bid-ask spreads; 
                
    a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity; 
                
    whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; 
                
    whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; 
                
    whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and 
                
    whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value. 
     Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or by other foreign governments, to-be-announced securities and non-callable securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities. 
  Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, certain derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, corporate debt, foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain commercial loans held for sale, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information met the fair value objective. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair  
  
   125 

HSBC USA Inc. 

value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument. 
  Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain structured derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable benchmark index tranches traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors. In addition, a validation process has been established, which includes participation in peer group consensus pricing surveys, to ensure that valuation inputs incorporate market participants' risk expectations and risk premium.  
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our Level 3 instruments included the following: collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs") for which there is a lack of pricing transparency due to market illiquidity, certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), credit default swaps ("CDS") with certain monoline insurers where the deterioration in the creditworthiness of the counterparty, which is unobservable, has resulted in significant adjustments to fair value, credit derivatives executed against certain insurers where there is uncertainty in determining fair value, certain residential mortgage and subprime mortgage loans held for sale, certain corporate debt securities, impaired commercial loans, derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and, at December 31, 2015, mortgage servicing rights.  
  See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs as well as a discussion of transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Level 3 Measurements    The following table provides information about Level 3 assets/liabilities in relation to total assets/liabilities measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    Presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met. 
       Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    We have entered into credit default swaps with monoline insurers to hedge our credit exposure in certain asset-backed securities and synthetic CDOs. We made $12 million and $25 million positive credit risk adjustments to the fair value of our credit default swap contracts during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with positive adjustments of $12 million and $7 million during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. These adjustments to fair value are recorded in trading revenue (expense) in the consolidated statement of income. We have recorded a cumulative credit adjustment reserve of $25 million and $50 million against our monoline exposure at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of our monoline exposure net of cumulative credit adjustment reserves equaled $200 million and $173 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  See Note 19, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

HSBC USA Inc. 

Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs      The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities.  
  The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $26 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $13 million at   September 30, 2016  . The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers as well as credit default swaps with certain monoline insurers and certain asset-backed securities including CDOs.

Risk Management 

Overview    Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. To do so, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. It fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It is designed to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. We strive to continuously improve our risk management processes through ongoing employee training and development. 
  The principal risks associated with our operations include the following: 
             
    Credit risk   is the potential that a borrower or counterparty will default on a credit obligation, as well as the impact on the value of credit instruments due to changes in the probability of borrower default. Credit risk includes risk associated with cross-border exposures; 
     
   127 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Liquidity risk   is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due or fund its customers because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself; 
                
    Interest rate risk   is the potential impairment of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements; 
                
    Market risk   is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; 
                
    Operational risk   is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems, or from external events (including legal risk); 
                
    Compliance risk   is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation; 
                
    Fiduciary risk   is the risk of breaching fiduciary duties where we act in a fiduciary capacity as trustee, investment manager or as mandated by law or regulation; 
                
    Reputational risk   is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom it is associated, that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences;  
                
    Strategic risk   is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute, and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; 
                
    Security and Fraud risk   is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests; 
                
    Model risk   is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared with the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly; 
                
    Pension risk   is the risk that the cash flows associated with pension assets will not be enough to cover the pension benefit obligations required to be paid and includes the risk that assumptions used by our actuaries may differ from actual experience; and 
                
    Sustainability risk   is the risk that financial services provided to customers indirectly result in unacceptable impacts on people or on the environment. 
     See "Risk Management" in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices. Our risk management process involves the use of various simulation models. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable, but actual events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections. 
  Credit Risk Management    Credit risk is the potential that a borrower or counterparty will default on a credit obligation, as well as the impact on the value of credit instruments due to changes in the probability of borrower default. Credit risk includes risk associated with cross-border exposures. There have been no material changes to our approach towards credit risk management since December 31, 2015. See "Risk Management" in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk. 
  Credit risk is inherent in various on- and off-balance sheet instruments and arrangements, such as: 
             
    loan portfolios;

    derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps which, if more valuable today than when originally contracted, may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract. 
     While credit risk exists widely in our operations, diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure. Day-to-day management of credit and market risk is performed by the Chief Credit Officer/Head of Wholesale Credit and Market Risk North America and the HSBC North America Chief Retail Credit Officer, who report directly to the HSBC North America Chief Risk Officer and maintain independent risk functions. The credit risk associated with commercial portfolios is managed by the Chief Credit Officer, while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios, such as credit cards, installment loans and residential mortgages, is managed by the HSBC North America Chief Retail Credit Officer. Further discussion of credit risk can be found under the "Credit Quality" caption in this MD A.

Liquidity Risk Management    Prior to 2016, we employed two key measures to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. The advances to core funding ratio was used to monitor our structural long-term funding position. In addition, stressed coverage ratios, incorporating HSBC-specific stress scenarios, were used to monitor the resilience to severe liquidity stresses. Beginning in 2016, HSBC replaced these measures with the Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") and Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR") as discussed further below. As a result, we now employ these ratios as part of our approach to liquidity risk management. There have been no other material changes to our approach towards liquidity risk management since December 31, 2015. See  Risk Management  in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to liquidity risk. Although certain measures used in our overall approach to liquidity management have changed, we continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and continue to adapt our liquidity framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. Current regulatory initiatives encourage banks to retain a portfolio of extremely high quality liquid assets. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities. 
  Our liquidity management approach includes increased deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our business growth, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. As previously discussed, HSBC Finance relies on its affiliates, including HSBC USA, to satisfy its funding needs outside of cash generated from its loan sales and operations.  
  In addition, the Asset and Liability Management Committee monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships. 
  The Basel Committee based LCR is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the Basel Committee based LCR became a minimum regulatory standard beginning in 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, HSBC USA's LCR under the EU LCR rule was 135 percent and 121 percent, respectively. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. 
  The European calibration of the Basel Committee based NSFR, which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee final NSFR rule, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the European calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators. At September 30, 2016, HSBC USA's NSFR was 122 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 
  In 2014, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued final regulations to implement the LCR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The LCR final rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but is more stringent in several areas including the range of assets that will qualify as HQLA and the assumed rate of outflows of certain kinds of funding. Under the final rule, U.S. institutions began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100 percent by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. As a result, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, are required to maintain an LCR of 80 percent, starting on January 1, 2015 increasing annually by 10 percent increments and reaching 100 percent on January 1, 2017. The current requirement to report LCR to U.S. regulators on a monthly basis moved to a daily requirement beginning July 1, 2016. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR final rule was 127 percent and 114 percent, respectively. The LCR final rule does not address the NSFR requirement, which is currently in an international observation period. Based on the results of the observation period, the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators may make further changes to the NSFR. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR final rule, is more stringent in several areas including the required stable funding factors applied to certain assets such as mortgage-backed securities. Under the proposal, U.S. institutions would be required to comply with the NSFR rule by January 1, 2018, consistent with the scheduled global implementation of the Basel Committee based NSFR. 
  Enhanced prudential standard rules issued pursuant to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act complement the LCR, capital planning, resolution planning, and stress testing requirements for U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations with total global consolidated assets of $50 billion or more ("Covered Companies"). The rules require Covered Companies, such as HSBC North America, to comply with various liquidity risk management standards and to maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. Covered companies are also required to meet heightened liquidity requirements, which include qualitative liquidity standards, cash flow projections, internal liquidity stress tests, and liquidity buffer requirements. HSBC North America has implemented the standard and it does not have a significant impact to our  
  
   129 

HSBC USA Inc. 

business model. Beginning July 1, 2016, HSBC North America is treated as an IHC owned by a foreign banking organization. This transition did not have a significant impact on our U.S. operations or change our liquidity management policies. 
  HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules. 
  Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at   September 30, 2016  :

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions.  
  In March 2016, Moody's changed the rating outlook for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change for HSBC signifies Moody's concerns about a weakening in its intrinsic financial strength due to deteriorating operating conditions in Hong Kong, one of the HSBC's key markets. In spite of their concerns, Moody's stated that HSBC's willingness to provide support to its U.S. subsidiaries remains very high. While the outlook changed, Moody's affirmed its long- and short-term supported debt and deposit ratings for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA.  
  In July 2016, S P took various rating agency actions on U.K. banks, including HSBC, to reflect rising economic risks for the U.K. domestic banking industry, including potential pressures arising from the U.K. vote to leave the EU. As a result, S P changed the rating outlook for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable. While the outlook changed, S P affirmed its long- and short-term counterparty credit ratings for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA. 
  Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies. 
  Interest Rate Risk Management    Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts. Our approach to managing interest rate risk is summarized in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K under the caption  Risk Management . There have been no material changes to our approach towards interest rate risk management since December 31, 2015.  
  Present value of a basis point ("PVBP")   is the change in value of the balance sheet for a one basis point upward movement in all interest rates. The following table reflects the PVBP position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Net interest income simulation modeling techniques   are utilized to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios, which assume immediate market rate movements by as much as 200 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates rise by as much as 200 basis point or fall by as much as 100 basis points over a twelve month period. The following table reflects the impact on projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques: 

The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts. 
  Capital Risk/Sensitivity of Other Comprehensive Loss    Large movements of interest rates could directly affect some reported capital balances and ratios. The mark-to-market valuation of available-for-sale securities is recorded on a tax effected basis to accumulated other comprehensive loss. This valuation mark is included in two important accounting based capital ratios: common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and total shareholders' equity to total assets. Under the final rule adopting the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, the valuation mark is being phased into common equity Tier 1 capital over five years beginning in 2014. At   September 30, 2016  , we had an available-for-sale securities portfolio of approximately   $40,800 million   with a   positive   mark-to-market adjustment of   $381 million  . An increase of 25 basis points in interest rates of all maturities would lower the mark-to-market by approximately   $353 million   to a net   gain   of   $28 million   with the following results on our capital ratios: 

(1)   
    Proforma percentages reflect a 25 basis point increase in interest rates. 
     Market Risk Management    Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios. Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: 
             
    Trading portfolios   comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of customer-derived positions.  
                
    Non-trading portfolios   comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.  
     There have been no material changes to our approach towards market risk management since December 31, 2015. See  Risk Management  in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk. 
  Value at Risk ("VaR")    VaR is a technique that estimates the potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. VaR is calculated for all trading positions and non-trading positions which are equally sensitive to market moves regardless of how we capitalize those exposures. VAR is calculated at a 99 percent confidence level for a one-day holding period. 
  
   131 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Trading Portfolios    Trading VaR generates from the Global Markets unit of the GB M business segment. Portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products, interest rate swaps, credit derivatives, precious metals (i.e. gold, silver, platinum) in both North America and emerging markets. 
  Daily VaR (trading portfolios), 99 percent 1 day (in millions) : 
  
  The following table summarizes our trading VaR for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  :

    Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures. 
               (2)   
    The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR.  
     Backtesting    In   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced one backtesting exception. The profit exception occurred in March due to a gain from independent price verification on Venezuela single-name CDS positions. Independent price verification is not captured in the single day VaR model. 
  We daily validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect on average to see two to three profits, and two to three losses, in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confident level over a one-year period. The actual number of profits or losses in excess of VaR over this period can therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing. To ensure a conservative approach to calculating our risk exposures, it is important to note that profits in excess of VaR are only considered when backtesting the accuracy of models and are not used to calculate the VaR numbers used for risk management or capital purposes.

  Non-trading Portfolios    Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Balance Sheet Management ("BSM") and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available for sale and held to maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. agency mortgage backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates, mortgage spreads, and asset swap spreads.  
  The following table summarizes our non-trading VaR for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information. 
     Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transferred priced into BSM which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. For a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed, please refer to the  Risk Management - Interest Rate Risk Management  in MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Trading Portfolio MSRs    Trading occurs in mortgage banking operations as a result of an economic hedging program intended to offset changes in the value of mortgage servicing rights. Economic hedging may include, for example, forward contracts to sell residential mortgages and derivative instruments used to protect the value of MSRs. 
  MSRs are assets that represent the present value of net servicing income (servicing fees, ancillary income, escrow and deposit float, net of servicing costs). MSRs are separately recognized upon the sale of the underlying loans or at the time that servicing rights are purchased. MSRs are subject to interest rate risk, in that their value will decline as a result of actual and expected acceleration of prepayment of the underlying loans in a falling interest rate environment. 
  Interest rate risk is mitigated through an active hedging program that uses trading securities and derivative instruments to offset changes in value of MSRs. Since the hedging program involves trading activity, risk is quantified and managed using a number of risk assessment techniques.

The economic value of the net hedged MSRs portfolio is monitored on a daily basis for interest rate sensitivity. If the economic value declines by more than established limits for one day or one month, various levels of management review, intervention and/or corrective actions are required. 
  The following table summarizes the frequency distribution of the weekly economic value of the MSR asset during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This includes the change in the market value of the MSR asset net of changes in the market value of the underlying hedging positions used to hedge the asset. The changes in economic value are adjusted for changes in MSR valuation inputs or assumptions that were made during the course of the year.

CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES 

The following table summarizes the quarter-to-date and year-to-date average daily balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid, presented on a taxable equivalent basis, which resulted in increases to interest income on securities of less than a million and   $1 million   during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and increases to interest income on securities of   $3 million   and   $9 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average interest earning assets from which interest income is earned. Loan interest for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   included fees of $24 million and $57 million, respectively, compared with fees of $18 million and $51 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

  We conducted an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report so as to alert them in a timely fashion to material information required to be disclosed in reports we file under the Exchange Act. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 

See Note 20,  Litigation and Regulatory Matters,  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our legal proceedings disclosure, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 5.    Other Information 

Disclosures pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act    Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act requires each issuer registered with the SEC to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions with persons or entities targeted by U.S. sanctions programs relating to Iran, terrorism, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, even if those activities are not prohibited by U.S. law and are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with local laws and regulations. 
  To comply with this requirement, HSBC has requested relevant information from its affiliates globally. During the period covered by this Form 10-Q, HSBC USA Inc. did not engage in any activities or transactions requiring disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) other than those activities related to frozen accounts and transactions permitted under relevant U.S. sanction programs described under  Frozen Accounts and Transactions  below. The following activities conducted by our affiliates are disclosed in response to Section 13(r): 
  Loans in repayment      Between 2001 and 2005, the Project and Export Finance division of the HSBC Group arranged or participated in a portfolio of loans to Iranian energy companies and banks. All of these loans were guaranteed by European and Asian export credit agencies and have varied maturity dates with final maturity in 2018. For those loans that remain outstanding, the HSBC Group continues to seek repayment in accordance with its obligations to the supporting export credit agencies. Details of these loans follow. 
  At September 30, 2016, the HSBC Group had 5 loans outstanding to an Iranian petrochemical company. These loans are supported by the official export credit agencies of the following countries: the United Kingdom, South Korea and Japan. The HSBC Group continues to seek repayments from the Iranian company under the outstanding loans in accordance with their original maturity profiles. 
  Two loans to the same company which were supported by the German and South Korean Export Credit Agencies matured during the third quarter of 2016 following receipt of the final repayments.  
  
   137 

HSBC USA Inc. 

Estimated gross revenue to the HSBC Group generated by the loans in repayment for the third quarter of 2016, which includes interest and fees, was approximately $112,000, and net estimated profit was approximately $111,000. While the HSBC Group intends to continue to seek repayment under the existing loans, all of which were entered into before the petrochemical sector of Iran became a target of U.S. sanctions, it does not currently intend to extend any new loans. 
  Legacy contractual obligations related to guarantees      Between 1996 and 2007, the HSBC Group provided guarantees to a number of its non-Iranian customers in Europe and the Middle East for various business activities in Iran. In a number of cases, the HSBC Group issued counter indemnities in support of guarantees issued by Iranian banks as the Iranian beneficiaries of the guarantees required that they be backed directly by Iranian banks. The Iranian banks to which the HSBC Group provided counter indemnities included Bank Tejarat, Bank Melli, and the Bank of Industry and Mine. 
  There was no measurable gross revenue in the third quarter of 2016 under those guarantees and counter indemnities. The HSBC Group does not allocate direct costs to fees and commissions and, therefore, has not disclosed a separate net profit measure. The HSBC Group is seeking to cancel all relevant guarantees and counter indemnities and does not currently intend to provide any new guarantees or counter indemnities involving Iran. None were canceled in the third quarter of 2016 and approximately 20 remain outstanding. 
  Other relationships with Iranian banks    Activity related to U.S.-sanctioned Iranian banks not covered elsewhere in this disclosure includes the following: 
             
    The HSBC Group maintains several frozen accounts in the United Kingdom for an Iranian-owned, U.K.-regulated financial institution. Transactions relating to these accounts have been carried out under U.K. government license (or, particularly following Implementation Day under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action relating to the Iranian nuclear program, are generally permissible under applicable law). Estimated gross revenue in the third quarter of 2016 for these transactions, which includes fees and/or commissions, was approximately $32,700. 
                
    The HSBC Group acts as the trustee and administrator for a pension scheme involving five employees of a U.S.-sanctioned Iranian bank in Hong Kong, one of whom joined the scheme during the third quarter of 2016. Under the rules of this scheme, the HSBC Group accepts contributions from the Iranian bank each month and allocates the funds into the pension accounts of the Iranian bank s employees. The HSBC Group runs and operates this pension scheme in accordance with Hong Kong laws and regulations. Estimated gross revenue, which includes fees and/or commissions, generated by this pension scheme in the third quarter of 2016 was approximately $2,340.  
     For the Iranian bank related-activity discussed in this section, the HSBC Group does not allocate direct costs to fees and commissions and, therefore, has not disclosed a separate net profit measure. The HSBC Group currently intends to continue to wind down this activity, to the extent legally permissible, and not enter into any new such activity. 
  Activity related to U.S. Executive Order 13224      The HSBC Group maintained a credit card account for an individual sanctioned under U.S. Executive Order 13224 during the third quarter of 2016. The credit card has now been canceled. During the third quarter of 2016, the credit card was used for one minor debit transaction, and the HSBC Group received a payment relative to the credit card.
