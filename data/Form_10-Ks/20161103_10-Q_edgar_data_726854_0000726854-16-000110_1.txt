Note A    Background and Basis of Presentation 
    
  City Holding Company ("City Holding"), a West Virginia corporation headquartered in Charleston, West Virginia, is a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and conducts its principal activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, City National Bank of West Virginia ("City National").  City National is a retail and consumer-oriented community bank with   85   banking offices in West Virginia (  57  ), Virginia (  14  ), Kentucky (  11  )  and Ohio (  3  ).  City National provides credit, deposit, and trust and investment management services to its customers. In addition to its branch network, City National's delivery channels include ATMs, mobile banking, debit cards, interactive voice response systems, and Internet technology. The Company s business activities are currently limited to one reportable business segment, which is community banking. 
    
  On January 9, 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, to The Hilb Group effective January 1, 2015.  As a result of this sale, the Company recognized a one-time after tax gain of   $5.8 million   from this transaction in the first quarter of 2015. 
       
  On November 6, 2015, the Company consummated the acquisition of   three   branch locations from American Founders Bank, Inc. ( AFB ) located in Lexington, Kentucky. The Company acquired approximately   $119   million in performing loans and and assumed deposit liabilities of approximately   $145   million. The Company paid AFB a deposit premium of   5.5%   on non-time deposits acquired, and a loan premium of   1.0%   on loan balances acquired. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which are unaudited, include all of the accounts of the City Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company ). All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial condition for each of the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The Company s accounting and reporting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Such policies require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. Actual results could differ from management s estimates. 
    
  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from audited financial statements included in the Company s   2015   Annual Report to Shareholders.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the   2015   Annual Report of the Company. 
    
  Certain amounts in the financial statements have been reclassified.  Such reclassifications had no impact on shareholders  equity or net income for any period. 

Note B -   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern."

This ASU will become effective for the Company on December 31, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "  Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis."

   12 

     Table of Contents  

discounts. This ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to clarify the customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, "  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)."   ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The ASU also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   "Business Combinations (Topic 85): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."   The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The effect on earnings of the adjustments as a result of the change to the provisional amounts will be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amount that would've been recorded in the previous reporting periods will be presented separately on the face of the income statement or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.  This ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes."   This standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.  
       
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   "Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."   This standard makes several modifications to Subtopic 825-10 including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods on January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842).    This standard     requires organizations to recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing requirements for leases that were historically classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principals.  This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods on January 1, 2019.  Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share Based Accounting.

The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.    The amendments in this standard clarify identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance under Topic 606.  This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods on January 1, 2018. Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-10. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."   This standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.  The amendments in this update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new current  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

expected credit losses model (CECL) will apply to the allowance for loan losses, available-for-sale and held to maturity debt securities,  purchased financial assets with credit deterioration and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.  This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods on January 1, 2020.  Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU No. 2016-13 on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."   This amendment addresses existing diversity in practice regarding how certain receipts and payments are presented in the statement of cash flows.  Issues addressed in this amendment include debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle and their classifications in the statement of cash flows.  This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods on January 1, 2018.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

Note C    Investments 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair values of the Company's securities are shown in the following table (in thousands): 

Marketable equity securities consist of investments made by the Company in equity positions of various regional community banks. Included within this portfolio are ownership positions in the following community bank holding companies: First National Corporation (FXNC) (  4%  ) and Eagle Financial Services, Inc. (EFSI) (  1.5%  ). Securities with limited marketability,  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

such as stock in the Federal Reserve Bank ("Federal Reserve") and the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"), are carried at cost and are reported as non-marketable equity securities in the table above. 
    
  Certain investment securities owned by the Company were in an unrealized loss position (i.e., amortized cost basis exceeded the estimated fair value of the securities).  The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands): 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $0.4   million in investment impairment losses.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   investment impairment losses.  At   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative amount of credit-related investment impairment losses that have been recognized by the Company on investments that remain in the Company's investment portfolio as of that date was   $10.5 million   (  $8.9 million   related to the Company's debt securities and   $1.6 million   related to the Company's equity securities). 
    
  Declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary would be reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition, capital strength, and near-term (within 12 months) prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment or the discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential; (iii) the historical volatility in the market value of the investment and/or the liquidity or illiquidity of the investment; (iv) adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area; and (v) the intent to sell the investment security and if it s more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. In addition, management also employs a continuous monitoring process in regards to its marketable equity securities, specifically its portfolio of regional community bank holdings. Although the regional community bank stocks that are owned by the Company are publicly traded, the trading activity for these stocks is minimal, with trading volumes of less than   0.2%   of each respective company being traded on a daily basis. As part of management s review process for these securities, management reviews the financial condition of each respective regional community bank for any indications of financial weakness.

     Table of Contents  

Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held-to-maturity until they mature, at which time the Company expects to receive full value for the securities. Furthermore, as of   September 30, 2016  , management generally does not intend to sell an impaired security and it is not more than likely that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses on debt securities are primarily the result of interest rate changes, credit spread fluctuations on agency-issued mortgage related securities, general financial market uncertainty and unprecedented market volatility. These conditions should not prohibit the Company from receiving its contractual principal and interest payments on its debt securities. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date. As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes the unrealized losses detailed in the table above are temporary and no additional impairment loss has been recognized in the Company s consolidated income statement. Should the impairment of any of these securities become other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss will be recognized in net income in the period the other-than-temporary impairment is identified, while any noncredit loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income. 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown in the following table (in thousands).  Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

     Table of Contents  

Construction loans of   $12.3 million   and   $13.1 million   are included within residential real estate loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Construction loans of   $7.3 million   and   $12.6 million   are included within commercial real estate loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company s commercial and residential real estate construction loans are primarily secured by real estate within the Company s principal markets.  These loans were originated under the Company s loan policy, which is focused on the risk characteristics of residential and commercial real estate lending, including specific risks related to construction lending.  Adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the Company s allowance for loan losses.

Changes in the accretable yield of the credit-impaired loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is as follows (in thousands): 

Increases in expected cash flow subsequent to the acquisition are recognized first as a reduction of any previous impairment, then prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loans or pools over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for loan loss and an increase in the allowance for purchased credit-impaired loans. 

Note E     Allowance For Loan Losses 
    
  Management systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis to provide for probable losses inherent in the portfolio.  Management assesses the risk in each loan type based on historical trends, the general economic environment of its local markets, individual loan performance and other relevant factors. 
    
  Individual credits are selected throughout the year for detailed loan reviews, which are utilized by management to assess the risk in the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance.  Due to the nature of commercial lending, evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance as it relates to these loan types is often based more upon specific credit reviews, with consideration given to the potential impairment of certain credits and historical loss rates, adjusted for economic conditions and other inherent risk factors. 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan loss, by portfolio segment, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands).  The allocation of a portion of the allowance in one portfolio segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other portfolio segments.  The following table also presents the balance in the allowance for loan loss disaggregated on the basis of the Company s impairment measurement method and the related recorded investment in loans, by portfolio segment, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands).

During the second quarter of 2016, parts of West Virginia were impacted by tragic flooding. As a result of this flooding, the Company recognized   $0.3   million of loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2016 and its quarterly provision for loan losses reflects the impact of these losses. 
    
  Credit Quality Indicators 
    
  All commercial loans within the portfolio are subject to internal risk grading.  All non-commercial loans are evaluated based on payment history.  The Company s internal risk ratings for commercial loans are:  Pass, Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful.  Each internal risk rating is defined in the loan policy using the following criteria:  balance sheet yields; ratios and leverage; cash flow spread and coverage; prior history; capability of management; market position/industry; potential impact of changing economic, legal, regulatory or environmental conditions; purpose; structure; collateral support; and guarantor support.  Risk grades are generally assigned by the primary lending officer and are periodically evaluated by the Company s internal loan review process.  Based on an individual loan s risk grade, estimated loss percentages are applied to the outstanding balance of the loan to determine the amount of probable loss.

     Table of Contents  

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information regarding the customer s debt service ability, capacity, overall collateral position along with other economic trends, and historical payment performance.  The risk grades for each credit are updated when the Company receives current financial information, the loan is reviewed by the Company s internal loan review/credit administration departments, or the loan becomes delinquent or impaired.  The risk grades are updated a minimum of annually for loans rated exceptional, good, acceptable, or pass/watch.  Loans rated special mention, substandard or doubtful are reviewed at least quarterly.  The Company uses the following definitions for its risk ratings: 
    
                 Risk Rating 
    Description 
      Pass ratings: 
      
         (a) Exceptional 
    Loans classified as exceptional are secured with liquid collateral conforming to the internal loan policy.  Loans rated within this category pose minimal risk of loss to the bank.  
         (b) Good 
    Loans classified as good have similar characteristics that include a strong balance sheet, satisfactory debt service coverage ratios, strong management and/or guarantors, and little exposure to economic cycles. Loans in this category generally have a low chance of loss to the bank. 
         (c) Acceptable 
    Loans classified as acceptable have acceptable liquidity levels, adequate debt service coverage ratios, experienced management, and have average exposure to economic cycles.  Loans within this category generally have a low risk of loss to the bank.  
         (d) Pass/watch 
    Loans classified as pass/watch have erratic levels of leverage and/or liquidity, cash flow is volatile and the borrower is subject to moderate economic risk.  A borrower in this category poses a low to moderate risk of loss to the bank.  
      Special mention 
    Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness(es) that deserves management s close attention.  The potential weakness could result in deterioration of the loan repayment or the bank s credit position at some future date.  A loan rated in this category poses a moderate loss risk to the bank.  
      Substandard 
    Loans classified as substandard reflect a customer with a well defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt.  Loans in this category have the possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and the bank s collateral value is weakened by the financial deterioration of the borrower.  
      Doubtful 
    Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristics that make collection of the full contract amount highly improbable.  Loans rated in this category are most likely to cause the bank to have a loss due to a collateral shortfall or a negative capital position.

Aging Analysis of Accruing and Non-Accruing Loans 
    
  Interest income on loans is accrued and credited to operations based upon the principal amount outstanding, using methods that generally result in level rates of return.  Loan origination fees, and certain direct costs, are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield over the term of the loan.  The accrual of interest generally is discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest for all loan types.  However, any loan may be placed on non-accrual if the Company receives information that indicates a borrower is unable to meet the contractual terms of its respective loan agreement.  Other indicators considered for placing a loan on non-accrual status include the borrower s involvement in bankruptcies, foreclosures, repossessions, litigation and any other situation resulting in doubt as to whether full collection of contractual principal and interest is attainable.  When interest accruals are discontinued, unpaid interest recognized in income in the current year is reversed, and interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for loan losses.  Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the net realizable value of collateral exceeds the principal balance and related accrued interest, and the loan is in the process of collection. 
    
  Generally for all loan classes, interest income during the period the loan is non-performing is recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured.  Cash payments received on nonperforming loans are typically applied directly against the outstanding principal balance until the loan is fully repaid.  Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 

21 

     Table of Contents  

Generally, all loan types are considered past due when the contractual terms of a loan are not met and the borrower is   30   days or more past due on a payment.  Furthermore, residential and home equity loans are generally subject to charge-off when the loan becomes   120   days past due, depending on the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to dispose, versus the outstanding loan balance.  Commercial loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes   120   days past due.  Open-end consumer loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes   180   days past due. 
    
  A loan acquired and accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30 is reported as an accruing loan and a performing asset provided that the loan is performing in accordance with the initial expectations.  The loan would be considered non-performing if the loan's performance deteriorates below the initial expectations.

Approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million   of interest income would have been recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms.  There were no commitments to provide additional funds on non-accrual, impaired or other potential problem loans at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Loan Modifications 
    
  The Company s policy on loan modifications typically does not allow for modifications that would be considered a concession from the Company.  However, when there is a modification, the Company evaluates each modification to determine if the modification constitutes a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) in accordance with ASU 2011-2, whereby a modification of a loan would be considered a TDR when both of the following conditions are met: (1) a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) the modification constitutes a concession.  When determining whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company reviews whether the borrower is currently in payment default on any of its debt or whether it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default in the foreseeable future without the modification.  Other indicators of financial difficulty include whether the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy, the borrower s ability to continue as a going concern, and the borrower s projected cash flow to service its debt (including principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms for the foreseeable future, without a modification. 
    
  Regulatory guidance requires loans to be accounted for as collateral-dependent loans when borrowers have filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debt has been discharged by the bankruptcy court, and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt.  The filing of bankruptcy is deemed to be evidence that the borrower is in financial difficulty and the discharge of the debt by the bankruptcy court is deemed to be a concession granted to the borrower.

Note F     Long-Term Debt 
    
  The components of long-term debt are summarized below (in thousands): 

The Company formed a statutory business trust, City Holding Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ), under the laws of Delaware.  Capital Trust III was created for the exclusive purpose of (i) issuing trust-preferred capital securities ( Capital Securities ), which represent preferred undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust, (ii) using the proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities to acquire junior subordinated debentures ( Debentures ) issued by the Company, and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto.  The trust is considered a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary.  Accordingly, the accounts of the trust are not included in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Distributions on the Debentures are cumulative and will be payable quarterly at an interest rate of   3.50%   over the three month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly.  Interest payments are due in March, June, September and December.  The Debentures are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the Company (i) in whole at any time or in part from time-to-time, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, at any time within   90 days   following the occurrence and during the continuation of certain predefined events. 
    
  Payments of distributions on the Capital Securities and payments on redemption of the Capital Securities are guaranteed by the Company.  The Company also entered into an agreement as to expenses and liabilities with the trust pursuant to which it agreed, on a subordinated basis, to pay any cost, expenses or liabilities of the trust other than those arising under the Capital Securities.  The obligations of the Company under the Debentures, the related indentures, the trust agreement establishing the trust, the guarantees and the agreements as to expenses and liabilities, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the trust s obligations under the Capital Securities.  The Capital Securities issued by the statutory business trust qualify as Tier 1 capital for the Company under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines. 

Note G     Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company enters into derivative transactions principally to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and liabilities on future cash flows.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has derivative financial instruments not included in hedge relationships.  These derivatives consist of interest rate swaps and floors used for interest rate management purposes and derivatives executed with commercial banking customers to facilitate their interest rate management strategies.  For the majority of these instruments the Company acts as an intermediary for its customers.  Changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts for the most part offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company's results of operations.  The Company also has an interest rate swap for the purpose of hedging changes in LIBOR related to commercial real estate loans.  Hedge ineffectiveness is assessed quarterly and any ineffectiveness is recorded as non-interest expense.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , hedge ineffectiveness was less than   $0.1 million   for each respective period.

Certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet and/or subject to master netting arrangements.  The Company's derivative transactions with financial institution counterparties are generally executed under International Swaps and Derivative Association ("ISDA") master agreements which include "right of setoff" provisions.  In such cases there is generally a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and there may be an intention to settle such amounts on a net basis.  Nonetheless, the Company does not generally offset financial instruments for financial reporting purposes.  Information about financial instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   is presented in the following tables (in thousands):

Note H     Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the City Holding Company 2003 Incentive Plan and the City Holding Company 2013 Incentive Plan (the "2003 Plan  and "2013 Plan", respectively), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or its delegate, may, from time to time, grant stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), or restricted stock awards to employees, directors and individuals who provide service to the Company (collectively, "Plan Participants").  The 2003 Plan expired in April of 2013 and the 2013 Plan was approved by the Company's shareholders in April 2013.  A maximum of   750,000   shares of the Company s common stock may be issued upon the exercise of stock options, SARs and stock awards under the 2013 Plan.  These limitations may be adjusted in the event of a change in the number of outstanding shares of common stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split or other similar event.  Specific terms of options and SARs awarded, including vesting periods, exercise prices (stock price at date of grant) and expiration dates are determined at the date of grant and are evidenced by agreements between the Company and the awardee.  The exercise price of the option grants equals the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.  All incentive stock options and SARs will be exercisable up to   10 years    from the date granted and all options and SARs are exercisable for the period specified in the individual agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , under the 2003 Plan and 2013 Plan,   462,863   stock options had been awarded and   271,797   restricted stock awards had been awarded, respectively. 
    
  Each award from the 2003 Plan and 2013 Plan is evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the option price, the duration of the option, the number of shares to which the option pertains, and such other provisions as the Compensation Committee, or its delegate, determines.  The option price for each grant is equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant.  Options granted expire at such time as the Compensation Committee, or its delegate, determines at the date of the grant and in no event does the exercise period exceed a maximum of ten years.  Upon a change-in-control of the Company, as defined in the 2003 Plan and 2013 Plan, all outstanding options and awards shall immediately vest. 
    
  Certain stock options and restricted stock awards granted pursuant to the 2013 Plan have performance-based vesting requirements.  These shares will vest in three separate annual installments of approximately   33.33%   per installment on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date, subject further to performance-based vesting requirements. The performance-based vesting requirements are as follows: 
    
  * First Installment   the mean return on average assets of the Company (excluding merger and acquisition expenses and other nonrecurring items as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the three years immediately prior to the vesting date is equal to or exceeds the median return on average assets over the   20   year period immediately preceding the vesting date of all FDIC insured depository institutions. 
    
  * Second Installment   the mean return on average assets of the Company (excluding merger and acquisition expenses and other nonrecurring items as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the four years immediately prior to the vesting date is equal to or exceeds the median return on average assets over the   20   year period immediately preceding the vesting date of all FDIC insured depository institutions. 
    
  * Third Installment   the mean return on average assets of the Company (excluding merger and acquisition expenses and other nonrecurring items as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the five years immediately prior to the vesting date is equal to or exceeds the median return on average assets over the   20   year period immediately preceding the vesting date of all FDIC insured depository institutions.

The fair value of the options is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.   The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted: 

Restricted Shares 
    
  The Company records compensation expense with respect to restricted shares in an amount equal to the fair value of the common stock covered by each award on the date of grant. The restricted shares awarded become fully vested after various periods of continued employment from the respective dates of grant. The Company is entitled to an income tax deduction in an amount equal to the taxable income reported by the holders of the restricted shares when the restrictions are released and the shares are issued. Compensation is being charged to expense over the respective vesting periods. 
    
  Restricted shares are forfeited if the awardee officer or employee terminates his employment with the Company prior to the lapsing of restrictions. The Company records forfeitures of restricted stock as treasury share repurchases and any compensation cost previously recognized is reversed in the period of forfeiture.  Recipients of restricted shares do not pay any cash consideration to the Company for the shares, have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant and receive all dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not the shares have vested.   
    
  A summary of the Company s restricted shares activity and related information is presented below:

Benefit Plans 
    
  The Company provides retirement benefits to its employees through the City Holding Company 401(k) Plan and Trust (the  401(k) Plan ), which is intended to be compliant with Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) section 404(c).  The Company also maintains two frozen defined benefit pension plans  (the  Defined Benefit Plans ), which were inherited from the Company's acquisition of the plan sponsors (Horizon Bancorp, Inc. and Community Financial Corporation).  
    
  The following table presents details of the Company's activities pursuant to these plans (in thousands): 

Note I     Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  The Company has entered into agreements with certain customers to extend credit or provide a conditional commitment to provide payment on drafts presented in accordance with the terms of the underlying credit documents. The Company also provides overdraft protection to certain demand deposit customers that represent an unfunded commitment.  Overdraft protection commitments, which are included with other commitments below, are uncollateralized and are paid at the Company s discretion.  Conditional commitments generally include standby and commercial letters of credit. Standby letters of credit represent an obligation of the Company to a designated third party contingent upon the failure of a customer of the Company to perform under the terms of the underlying contract between the customer and the third party. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce. Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, drafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated, as intended, between the customer and a third party. The funded portion of these financial instruments is reflected in the Company s balance sheet, while the unfunded portion of these commitments is not reflected in the balance sheet.  The table below presents a summary of the contractual obligations of the Company resulting from significant commitments (in thousands): 

Loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit have credit risks essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company s standard credit policies. Collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer. Management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these commitments. 
    
  The Company is engaged in various legal actions that it deems to be in the ordinary course of business. As these legal actions are resolved, the Company could realize positive and/or negative impact to its financial performance in the period in which these legal actions are ultimately resolved. There can be no assurance that current legal actions will have an immaterial impact on financial results, either positive or negative, or that no material legal actions may be presented in the future.

During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   there were   no   anti-dilutive options outstanding. Options to purchase approximately   3,000   shares and   5,000   shares of common stock were outstanding during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of the options' exercises would have been anti-dilutive. 

Note L     Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 
    
  Level 1:   Quoted prices (unadjusted) or identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2:   Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3:   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
    
  The Company bases fair value of assets and liabilities on quoted market prices, prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  If such information is not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters.  Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value.  These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters.  Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time.  The Company s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  While management believes the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.  Furthermore, the reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance sheet date may differ significantly from the amount presented herein.  A more detailed description of the valuation methodologies used

     Table of Contents  

for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. 
    
  Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. 
    
  Securities Available for Sale  .  Securities available for sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs.  The fair value of securities available for sale is determined by utilizing a market approach by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (other than forced or distressed transactions) that occur in sufficient volume or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.  If such measurements are unavailable, the security is classified as Level 3.  Significant judgment is required to make this determination. 
    
  The Company utilizes a third party pricing service provider to value its Level 1 and Level 2 investment securities.  Annually, the Company obtains an independent auditor s report from its third party pricing service provider regarding its controls over investment securities.  Although no control deficiencies were noted, the report did contain caveats and disclaimers regarding the pricing information, such as the Company should review fair values for reasonableness.  On a quarterly basis, the Company selects a sample of its debt securities and reprices those securities with a third party that is independent of the primary pricing service provider to verify the reasonableness of the fair values.  In addition, the Company selects a sample of securities and reviews the underlying support from the primary pricing service provider. 
    
  The Company has determined that its pooled trust preferred securities should be priced using Level 3 inputs in accordance with ASC Topic 820 and guidance issued by the SEC.  The Company has determined that there are few observable transactions and market quotations available for pooled trust preferred securities and they are not reliable for purposes of determining fair value at   September 30, 2016  .  Due to these circumstances, the Company has elected to utilize an income valuation approach produced by a third party pricing source.  This third party model utilizes deferral and default probabilities for the underlying issuers, estimated prepayment rates and assumes no future recoveries of any defaults or deferrals.  The Company then compares the values provided by the third party model with other external sources.  At such time as there are observable transactions or quoted prices that are associated with an orderly and active market for pooled trust preferred securities, the Company will incorporate such market values in its estimate of fair values for these securities. 
    
  Derivatives  .     Derivatives are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.  The Company utilizes a market approach by obtaining dealer quotations to value its customer interest rate swaps.  The Company s derivatives are included within its Other Assets and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Derivative assets are typically secured through securities with financial counterparties or cross collateralization with a borrowing customer.  Derivative liabilities are typically secured through the Company pledging securities to financial counterparties or, in the case of a borrowing customer, by the right of setoff.  The Company considers factors such as the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties, right of setoff, and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate fair value adjustments.  All derivative counterparties approved by the Company's Asset and Liability Committee ("ALCO") are regularly reviewed, and appropriate business action is taken to adjust the exposure to certain counterparties, if necessary.  Counterparty exposure is evaluated by netting positions that are subject to master netting agreements, as well as considering the amount of marketable collateral securing the position.  This approach used to estimate impacted exposures to counterparties is also used by the Company to estimate its own credit risk in derivative liability positions.  To date, no material losses have been incurred due to a counterparty's inability to pay any undercollateralized position.  There was   no   significant change in the value of derivative assets and liabilities attributed to credit risk that would have resulted in a derivative credit risk valuation adjustment at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include impaired loans reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.  Collateral values are estimated using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data for real estate collateral or Level 3 inputs for non-real estate collateral.  The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value (in thousands):

The table below presents a reconcilement of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consist solely of trust preferred securities (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

The Company utilizes a third party model to compute the present value of expected cash flows which considers the structure and term of each of the five respective pooled trust preferred securities and the financial condition of the underlying issuers.  Specifically, the third party model details interest rates, principal balances of note classes and underlying issuers, the timing and amount of interest and principal payments of the underlying issuers, and the allocation of the payments to the note classes. The current estimate of expected cash flows is based on the most recent trustee reports and any other relevant market information including announcements of interest payment deferrals or defaults of underlying trust preferred securities. For issuing banks that have defaulted, management generally assumes no recovery. For issuing banks that have deferred interest payments, management excludes the collateral balance associated with these banks and assumes no recoveries of such collateral balance in the future. The exclusion of such issuing banks in a current deferral position is based on such bank experiencing a certain level of financial difficulty that raises doubt about its ability to satisfy its contractual debt obligation, and accordingly, the Company excludes the associated collateral balance from its estimate of expected cash flows. Other assumptions used in the estimate of expected cash flows include expected future default rates and prepayments. Specifically, the model assumes annual prepayments of   1.0%   with   100%   at maturity and assumes 150 basis points of additional annual defaults from banks that are currently not in default or deferral.  In addition, the model assumes no recoveries except for one trust preferred security which assumes that one of the banks currently deferring or in default will cure such positions. 
    
  The table below presents a reconcilement of the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which solely relates to impaired loans that were remeasured and reported at fair value through a specific valuation allowance allocation of the allowance for loan losses based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral (in thousands).  The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows.  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent impaired loans primarily relate to discounts applied to the customers  reported amount of collateral.  The amount of collateral discount depends upon the marketability of the underlying collateral.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , collateral discounts ranged from   20%   to   30%  .   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had no Level 2 financial assets and liabilities that were measured on a nonrecurring basis. 

Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities 

36 

     Table of Contents  

The Company has no non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Certain non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include other real estate owned ( OREO ), which is measured at the lower of cost or fair value, and goodwill and other intangible assets, which are measured at fair value for impairment assessments.  The table below presents OREO that was remeasured and reported at fair value based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands): 

ASC Topic 825      Financial Instruments , as amended, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rate and estimate of future cash flows.  In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.  ASC Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value for financial instruments: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents:    Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. 
    
  Securities:    The fair value of securities, both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, are generally based on quoted market prices or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. 
    
  Net loans:    The fair value of the loan portfolio is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers for the same remaining maturities. Loans were first segregated by type such as commercial, real estate and consumer, and were then further segmented into fixed, adjustable and variable rate categories. Expected future cash flows were projected based on contractual cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments. 
    
  Deposits:    The fair values of demand deposits (i.e., interest and noninterest-bearing deposits, regular savings and other money market demand accounts) are, by definition, equal to their carrying values.  The fair values of time deposits were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. The discount rates used were based on rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. The fair values of the time deposit liabilities do not take into consideration the value of the Company s long-term relationships with depositors, which may have significant value. 

37 

     Table of Contents  

Short-term debt:    Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent borrowings with original maturities of less than 90 days.  The carrying amount of borrowings under purchase agreements approximate their fair value. 
    
  Long-term debt:   The fair value of long-term borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and market conditions of similar debt instruments. 
    
  Commitments and letters of credit:   The fair values of commitments are estimated based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into consideration the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  The fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date.  The amounts of fees currently charged on commitments and letters of credit are deemed insignificant, and therefore, the estimated fair values and carrying values have not been reflected in the table below. 
    
  The following table represents the estimates of fair value of financial instruments (in thousands). This table excludes financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value. For short-term financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization. For financial liabilities such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to these products having no stated maturity.

Item 2 -  
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The accounting policies of the Company conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnotes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available to management as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates. As this information changes, management s estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Company s financial statements and related disclosures may also change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note One to the audited financial statements included in the Company s   2015    Annual Report to Shareholders. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the   2015   Annual Report of the Company.  Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, income taxes and purchased credit-impaired loans to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.  
    
  The section   Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses   provides management s analysis of the Company s allowance for loan losses and related provision. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance for loan losses related to loans considered to be impaired is generally evaluated based on the discounted cash flows using the impaired loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. 
    
  The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business.  In computing the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments regarding interpretation of laws in those jurisdictions.  Because the application of tax laws and regulations for many types of transactions is susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing authorities.  On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate for the year and uses that rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next twelve months as a result of various factors.  However, management cannot currently estimate the range of possible change.  The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended December 31, 2013 through 2015.  The Company is open to audit under various state taxing authorities' statutes of limitations for the years ended December 31, 2012 through 2015. 
    
  The Company values purchased credit-impaired loans at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 310-30.  In determining the estimated fair value, management considers several factors, such as estimated future credit losses, estimated prepayments, remaining lives of the acquired loans, estimated value of the underlying collateral and the net present value of the cash flows expected to be received. For these loans, the expected cash flows that exceed the fair value of the loan represent the accretable yield, which is recognized as interest income on a level-yield basis over the expected cash flow periods of the loans.  The non-accretable difference represents the difference between the contractually required principal and interest payments and the cash flows expected to be collected based upon management's estimation.  Subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows will require the Company to evaluate the need for additions to the Company's allowance for loan losses.  Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows will result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges with a corresponding adjustment to the accretable yield, which will result in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. 

Financial Summary 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
    
  The Company's financial performance is summarized in the following table: 
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

*ROA (Return on Average Assets) is a measure of the effectiveness of asset utilization.  ROE (Return on Average Equity) is a measure of the return on shareholders' investment.  ROATCE (Return on Average Tangible Common Equity) is a measure of the return on shareholders' equity, less intangible assets. 
    
  The Company's net interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $2.5 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the AFB branch acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015 (see   Net Interest Income  ), higher average residential and commercial loan balances and higher average investment security balances.  The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of   $3.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $4.2   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   (see   Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses  ).  As further discussed under the caption   Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense  , non-interest income decreased   $8.7 million  , primarily due to the sale of CityInsurance in the first quarter of 2015.  Non-interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $1.9 million   from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the AFB branch acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015    
    
  The Company's financial performance is summarized in the following table: 

The Company s net interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $1.9 million   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the AFB branch acquisition in the fourth quarter of  2015, growth in the average balances of the commercial real estate and residential real estate loans,  and an increase in average investment balances (see   Net Interest Income  ). The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   (see   Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses  ).  As further discussed under the caption   Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense  , non-interest income increased   $3.0 million   as a result of realized investment gains in the third quarter of 2016 and non-interest expense decreased   $0.1 million   from the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 

Balance Sheet Analysis 
    
  Selected balance sheet fluctuations from the year ended   December 31, 2015   are summarized in the following table (in millions): 

40 

     Table of Contents  

Investment securities increased   $54.8 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   primarily due to additional investment purchases made during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Gross loans increased   $95.4 million   (  3.3%  ) from   December 31, 2015   to   $2.96 billion   at   September 30, 2016  .  Residential real estate loans increased   $62.1 million   (  4.5%  ), commercial real estate loans increased   $30.5 million   (  2.7%  ) and commercial and industrial loans increased   $11.0 million   (  6.7%  ).  These increases were partially offset by decreases in home equity loans of   $5.4 million   and consumer loans of   $2.5 million  . 
    
  Other assets and other liabilities increased   $13.7 million  , primarily due to an increase in market values and additional customer interest rate swap contracts entered into during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which are primarily used in the Company's back-to-back program and are reported on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Total deposits increased   $95.3 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   $3.18 billion   at   September 30, 2016   partially due to a large non-interest bearing deposit on the last day of the first quarter of 2016 with a balance of   $45.7   million as of   September 30, 2016  , growth in demand deposit accounts of   $33.9 million   and growth in time deposits of   $13.0 million  .  Total average depository balances increased   $184.6   million or   6.2%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the quarter ended   December 31, 2015   consisting of increases in non-interest bearing deposits (  $91.6 million  ), interest bearing deposits (  $37.0 million  ), savings deposits (  $29.6 million  ) and time deposits (  $26.4 million  ).  The growth is partially attributable to deposits acquired from AFB.  
    
  Customer repurchase agreements increased $  31.5 million   to from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  This is due to an increase in the Company's commercial sweep accounts. 

Net Interest Income 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015    
    
  The Company s tax equivalent net interest income increased   $2.7 million  , or   3.1%  , from   $86.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $89.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company s reported net interest margin decreased from   3.81%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   3.52%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Excluding the favorable impact of accretion, the net interest margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   would have been   3.43%   and   3.58%  , respectively.  
    
       The following schedule presents the estimated future accretion on net interest income as a result of the Company's acquisitions (in thousands).  The amounts in the table below require management to make significant assumptions based on estimated future default, prepayment and discount rates.  Actual performance could be significantly different from that assumed, which could result in actual results being materially different than those estimated below.

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Management of the Company uses measures in its analysis of the Company's performance other than those in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the United States of America ("GAAP").  These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance of the Company's operations.  The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period.  The Company's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial performance without the impact of these items that may obscure trends in the Company's performance.  These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies.

     Table of Contents  

Loan balances increased   $95.4 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  Residential real estate loans increased   $62.1 million  , or   4.5%  , from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a first lien on residential property. Residential real estate loans provide for the purchase or refinance of a residence and first-lien home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans primarily consist of single family 3 and 5 year adjustable rate mortgages with terms that amortize up to 30 years. The Company also offers fixed-rate residential real estate loans that are sold in the secondary market that are not included on the Company's balance sheet; the Company does not retain the servicing rights to these loans. Residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten to comply with Fannie Mae guidelines, while the home equity loans are underwritten with typically less documentation, but with lower loan-to-value ratios and shorter maturities.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $12.3 million   of the residential real estate loans were for properties under construction. 
    
  Home equity loans decreased   $5.4 million   during the   first nine months of 2016  .  The Company's home equity loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a second (or junior) lien on a residential property. Home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against the equity in their home without paying off an existing first lien. These loans consist of home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") and amortized home equity loans that require monthly installment payments. Home equity loans are underwritten with less documentation, lower loan-to-value ratios and for shorter terms. The amount of credit extended is directly related to the value of the real estate at the time the loan is made.  
    
  The commercial and industrial ("C I") loan portfolio consists of loans to corporate borrowers primarily in small to mid-size industrial and commercial companies. Collateral securing these loans includes equipment, machinery, inventory, receivables and vehicles. C I loans are considered to contain a higher level of risk than other loan types, although care is taken to minimize these risks. Numerous risk factors impact this portfolio, including industry specific risks such as the economy, new technology, labor rates and cyclicality, as well as customer specific factors, such as cash flow, financial structure, operating controls and asset quality.  C I loans increased   $11.0 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages, which generally are secured by nonresidential and multi-family residential properties, including hotel/motel and apartment lending. Commercial real estate loans are to many of the same customers and carry similar industry risks as C I loans. Commercial real estate loans increased   $30.5 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , despite the unanticipated repayment of a $16.1 million loan late in the second quarter.  This repayment was significant in that it was one of the Company's largest individual loans.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $7.3 million   of the commercial real estate loans were for commercial properties under construction.   
    
  Consumer loans may be secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and other personal property. The Company monitors the risk associated with these types of loans by monitoring such factors as portfolio growth, lending policies and economic conditions. Underwriting standards are continually evaluated and modified based upon these factors. Consumer loans decreased   $2.5 million   during the   first nine months of 2016  .

Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  Table Seven 
  Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  An analysis of changes in the Company's allowance for loan losses follows (dollars in thousands): 

Management systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses ( ALLL ) on a quarterly basis to provide for probable losses incurred in the portfolio. Management assesses the risk in each loan type based on historical delinquency and loss trends, the general economic environment of its local markets, individual loan performance, and other relevant factors. Individual credits in excess of $1 million are selected at least annually for detailed loan reviews, which are utilized by management to assess the risk in the portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance. Due to the nature of commercial lending, evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance as it relates to these loan types is often based more upon specific credit review, with consideration given to the potential impairment of certain credits and historical loss rates, adjusted for general economic conditions and other inherent risk factors. Conversely, due to the homogeneous nature of the real estate and installment portfolios, the portions of the allowance allocated to those portfolios are primarily based on prior loss history of each portfolio, adjusted for general economic conditions and other inherent risk factors. Risk factors considered by the Company in completing this analysis include: (i) unemployment and economic trends in the Company s markets; (ii) concentrations of credit, if any, among any industries; (iii) trends in loan growth, loan mix, delinquencies, losses or credit impairment; and (iv) adherence to lending policies and others. Each risk factor is designated as low, moderate/increasing, or high based on the Company s assessment of the risk to loss associated with each factor. Each risk factor is then weighted to consider probability of occurrence. 

49 

     Table of Contents  

In evaluating the adequacy of the ALLL, management considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors include actual repayment characteristics and loan performance, cash flow analyses, and estimated fair values of underlying collateral. Qualitative factors generally include overall trends within the portfolio, composition of the portfolio, changes in pricing or underwriting, seasoning of the portfolio, and general economic conditions. 
    
  The allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits is generally determined by analyzing potential exposure and other qualitative factors that could negatively impact the adequacy of the allowance.  Loans not individually evaluated for impairment are grouped by pools with similar risk characteristics and the related historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current inherent risk factors, such as unemployment, overall economic conditions, concentrations of credit, loan growth, classified and impaired loan trends, staffing, adherence to lending policies, and loss trends. 
    
  Determination of the ALLL is subjective in nature and requires management to periodically reassess the validity of its assumptions. Differences between actual losses and estimated losses are assessed such that management can timely modify its evaluation model to ensure that adequate provision has been made for risk in the total loan portfolio. 
    
  As a result of the Company s quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the ALLL, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses of   $3.1 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   as compared to   $4.2 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  The provision for loan losses recorded in the   first nine months of 2016   reflects the growth in the loan portfolio, losses attributable to the West Virginia flooding experienced in June 2016 and changes in the quality of the portfolio.  Changes in the amount of the provision and related allowance are based on the Company s detailed systematic methodology and are directionally consistent with changes in the composition and quality of the Company s loan portfolio. The Company believes its methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALLL adequately provides for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and produces a provision and allowance for loan losses that is directionally consistent with changes in asset quality and loss experience.   
    
  The Company had net charge-offs of   $2.8 million   for the   first nine months of 2016   and   $4.1 million   for the   first nine months of 2015  .  Net charge-offs in the   first nine months of 2016   consisted primarily of net charge-offs on  residential real estate loans (  $1.2 million  ) and commercial real estate loans (  $0.8 million  ).   
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, parts of West Virginia were impacted by tragic flooding. As a result of this flooding, the Company recognized   $0.3   million of loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2016 and our quarterly provision for loan losses has been adjusted to recognize these losses.  The Company does not expect to incur any further significant losses as a result of this flooding. 
    
  Based on the Company s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and in consideration of the known factors utilized in computing the allowance, management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016   is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio. Future provisions for loan losses will be dependent upon trends in loan balances including the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in loan quality and loss experience trends, and recoveries of previously charged-off loans, among other factors. 
    
  Table Eight 
  Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The allocation of the allowance for loan losses is shown in the table below (in thousands).  The allocation of a portion of the allowance in one portfolio segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other portfolio segments.   

The ALLL increased slightly from   $19.3 million   at December 31, 2015 to   $19.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Below is a summary of the changes in the components of the ALLL from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

The allowance related to the commercial and industrial loan portfolio increased   $0.8 million   from   $3.3 million   at December 31, 2015 to   $4.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  This increase is due to an increase in loans classified as substandard as of   September 30, 2016   and growth in the loan portfolio. 
    
  The allowance allocated to the commercial real estate portfolio decreased   $0.7 million   from   $7.0 million   at December 31, 2015 to   $6.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an improvement in the historical loss rate of the portfolio which was partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio. 
    
  The allowance allocated to the residential real estate portfolio increased from   $6.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   to $7.0 million at   September 30, 2016  .  The increase is due to growth in the loan portfolio which was partially offset by decreases in the historical loss rate of the portfolio. 
    
  The allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio decreased slightly from   $1.5 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $1.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The allowance allocated to the consumer loan portfolio remained flat at   $0.1 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The allowance allocated to overdraft deposit accounts remained flat at   $0.7 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Non-Performing Assets 
    
  Table Nine 
  Non-Performing Loans 
    
  The Company's nonperforming assets are shown below (dollars in thousands): 

Non-accrual loans decreased   $2.4 million   from   $16.9 million   at December 31, 2015 to   $14.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The average recorded investment in impaired loans during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $6.5 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively.  There were no commitments to provide additional funds on non-accrual, impaired, or other potential problem loans at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  The Company s ratio of non-performing assets to total loans and other real estate owned improved from   0.61%   at   December 31, 2015   to   0.51%   at   September 30, 2016  .  This improvement was primarily related to a single commercial customer engaged in the mining and energy sectors (per the North American Industry Classification System) which filed for bankruptcy and for which the Company recorded a charge-off.  Excluded from this ratio are purchased credit-impaired loans in which the Company estimated cash flows and estimated a credit mark.  These loans are considered performing loans provided that the loan is performing in accordance with the estimated expectations.  Such loans would be considered non-performing loans if the loan's performance deteriorates below the initial expectations.

     Table of Contents  

The Company recognized less than   $0.1 million   of interest income received in cash on non-accrual and impaired loans for both the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  Approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million   of interest income would have been recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms.  Interest on loans is accrued and credited to operations based upon the principal amount outstanding.  The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection.  When interest accruals are discontinued, interest credited to income in the current year that is unpaid and deemed uncollectible is charged to operations.  Prior-year interest accruals that are unpaid and deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan losses, provided that such amounts were specifically reserved. 
    
  Table Ten 
  Troubled Debt Restructurings ("TDRs") 
    
  The following table sets forth the Company's troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") (in thousands): 

Regulatory guidance requires that loans be accounted for as collateral-dependent loans when borrowers have filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debt has been discharged by the bankruptcy court and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt.  The filing of bankruptcy is deemed to be evidence that the borrower is in financial difficulty and the discharge of debt by the bankruptcy court is deemed to be a concession granted to the borrower.  The Company's troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") related to its borrowers who had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection make up   84%   of the Company's total TDRs as of   September 30, 2016  .  The average age of these TDRs was   11.6   years; the average current balance as a percentage of the original balance was   67.6%  ; and the average loan-to-value ratio was   65.7%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Of the total   493   Chapter 7 related TDRs,   43   had an estimated loss exposure based on the current balance and appraised value at   September 30, 2016  .

Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015    
  (in millions) 

Non-Interest Income:    The Company realized   $3.5 million   of investment gains during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $2.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  These gains represented partial recoveries of impairment charges previously recognized on pools of trust preferred securities.  On January 1, 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of   $11.1 million  .  Exclusive of these gains, non-interest income increased from   $39.9 million   for the first nine months of 2015 to   $40.9 million   for the first nine months of 2016.  This increase was due to service charges increasing   $0.3 million   to   $19.7 million  , bankcard revenues increasing   $0.4 million   to   $12.4 million  , and trust and investment management fee income increasing   $0.4 million   to   $4.0 million  . 
    
  Non-Interest Expense:   Non-interest expenses, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased   $2.2 million  , from   $71.5 million   in the first nine months of 2015 to   $73.7 million   in the first nine months of 2016.  This increase was largely due to the acquisition of three branches from AFB (for an increase of   $1.5 million  ), partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of   $0.7 million  .  The decrease in other expenses is primarily related to the   $1.4 million   recognition of expense associated with the write down of the investment in Mountaineer Capital LP in the third quarter of 2015, which was partially offset by an asset write down of   $0.4 million   in the third quarter of 2016, and the change in the fair value adjustment for a   $5 million   notional interest rate swap to protect against changes in long-term fixed interest rates related to commercial loans of   $0.2 million  . 
    
  Income Tax Expense:   The Company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   33.3%   compared to   34.4%   for the year ended December 31, 2015, and   35.8%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  As noted previously, the Company sold CityInsurance in the first quarter of 2015.  As a result of differences between the book basis and tax basis of the assets that were sold, the Company s income tax expense increased by $1.1 million.  Exclusive of the sale of CityInsurance in the first quarter of 2015, the Company s tax rate from operations was   33.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015    
  (in millions) 

Non-Interest Income:    During the third quarter of 2016, the Company realized investment gains of   $2.7 million   .  These gains represented partial recoveries of impairment charges previously recognized on pools of trust preferred securities.  Exclusive of these gains, non-interest income increased from   $13.7 million   for the third quarter of 2015 to   $14.1 million   for the third quarter of 2016.  This increase was mainly due to an increase in bankcard revenues of   $0.3 million  , or   8.2%  , from the third quarter of 2015 to   $4.2 million   and an increase in trust and investment management fees of   $0.2 million   or   13.0%   to   $1.3 million  . 
    
  Non-Interest Expense:    Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related expenses) increased   $0.1 million  , from   25.2 million   in the third quarter of 2015 to   $25.3 million   in the third quarter of 2016.  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

realized a   $1.4 million   expense associated with the write down of an investment in Mountaineer Capital LP .  Exclusive of these expenses during the third quarter of 2015, non-interest expenses increased   $1.5 million  , from   $23.8 million   in the third quarter of 2015 to   $25.3 million   in the third quarter of 2016.  This increase was due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of   $0.6 million  , the acquisition of the AFB branches (  $0.5 million  ) in November 2015, an increase in legal and professional fees of   $0.4 million   and an increase in bankcard expenses of   $0.3 million  .  The increase in salaries and employee benefits is due to salary adjustments and increased health insurance costs, while the increase in legal and professional fees is related to the settlement of a legal dispute associated with the sales of loans to a third party in the late 1990s.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in realized losses on sales of repossessed assets of   $0.2 million   from the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Income Tax Expense:    The Company's effective income tax rate for the   third quarter   of 2016 was   33.2%   compared to   32.6%   for the   third quarter   of 2015.  The effective income tax rate is based upon the Company's expected tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Risk Management 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in current and future cash flows, fair values, earnings or capital due to adverse movements in interest rates and other factors, including foreign exchange rates, underlying credit risk and commodity prices. Because the Company has no significant foreign exchange activities and holds no commodities, interest rate risk represents the primary risk factor affecting the Company s balance sheet and net interest margin. Significant changes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could result in similar changes in LIBOR interest rates, prime rates, and other benchmark interest rates that could affect the estimated fair value of the Company s investment securities portfolio, interest paid on the Company s short-term and long-term borrowings, interest earned on the Company s loan portfolio and interest paid on its deposit accounts.  
    
  The Company s Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO ) has been delegated the responsibility of managing the Company s interest-sensitive balance sheet accounts to maximize earnings while managing interest rate risk. ALCO, comprised of various members of executive and senior management, is also responsible for establishing policies to monitor and limit the Company s exposure to interest rate risk and to manage the Company s liquidity position. ALCO satisfies its responsibilities through quarterly meetings during which product pricing issues, liquidity measures, and interest sensitivity positions are monitored. 
    
  In order to measure and manage its interest rate risk, the Company uses an asset/liability management and simulation software model to periodically update the interest sensitivity position of the Company s balance sheet. The model is also used to perform analyses that measure the impact on net interest income and capital as a result of various changes in the interest rate environment. Such analyses quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income.  
    
  The Company s policy objective is to avoid negative fluctuations in net income or the economic value of equity of more than 15% within a 12-month period, assuming an immediate parallel increase or decrease of 400 basis points. The Company measures the long-term risk associated with sustained increases and decreases in rates through analysis of the impact to changes in rates on the economic value of equity.  
    
  The following table summarizes the sensitivity of the Company s net income to various interest rate scenarios. The results of the sensitivity analyses presented below differ from the results used internally by ALCO in that, in the analyses below, interest rates are assumed to have an immediate and sustained parallel shock. The Company recognizes that rates are volatile, but rarely move with immediate and parallel effects. Internally, the Company considers a variety of interest rate scenarios that are deemed to be possible while considering the level of risk it is willing to assume in  worst-case  scenarios such as shown by the following: 
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

These estimates are highly dependent upon assumptions made by management, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding the manner in which interest-bearing demand deposit and saving deposit accounts reprice in different interest rate scenarios, changes in the composition of deposit balances, pricing behavior of competitors, prepayments of loans and deposits under alternative rate environments, and new business volumes and pricing. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates above will be achieved in the event that interest rates increase during   2016   and beyond.  The estimates above do not necessarily imply that the Company will experience increases in net income if market interest rates rise.  The table above indicates how the Company s net income behaves relative to an increase or decrease in rates compared to what would otherwise occur if rates remain stable. 
    
  Based upon the estimates above, the Company believes that its net income is positively correlated with increasing rates as compared to the level of net income the Company would expect if interest rates remain flat. 

Liquidity 
    
  The Company evaluates the adequacy of liquidity at both the City Holding Company ("City Holding") level and at the banking subsidiary level. At the City Holding level, the principal source of cash is dividends from its banking subsidiary, City National Bank ("City National"). Dividends paid by City National to City Holding are subject to certain legal and regulatory limitations. Generally, any dividends in amounts that exceed the earnings retained by City National in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years must be approved by regulatory authorities. At   September 30, 2016  , City National could pay dividends up to   $50.8 million   plus net profits for the remainder of   2016  , as defined by statute, up to the dividend declaration date without prior regulatory permission. 
    
  City Holding used cash obtained from the dividends received primarily to: (i) pay common dividends to shareholders, (ii) remit interest payments on the Company s junior subordinated debentures and (iii) fund repurchases of the Company's common shares. 
    
  Over the next 12 months, City Holding has an obligation to remit interest payments approximating   $0.7 million   on the debentures held by City Holding Capital Trust III. Interest payments on the debentures can be deferred for up to five years under certain circumstances and dividends to shareholders can, if necessary, be suspended. City Holding anticipates continuing the payment of dividends on its common stock, which are expected to approximate   $25.8 million   on an annualized basis over the next 12 months based on common shareholders outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  In addition to these anticipated cash needs, City Holding has operating expenses and other contractual obligations, which are estimated to require   $1.4 million   of additional cash over the next 12 months. As of   September 30, 2016  , City Holding reported a cash balance of   $19.3 million   and management believes that City Holding s available cash balance, together with cash dividends from City National, will be adequate to satisfy its funding and cash needs over the next 12 months. 
    
  Excluding the interest and dividend payments discussed above, City Holding has no significant commitments or obligations in years after   2016   other than the repayment of its   $16.5 million   obligation under the debentures held by City Holding Capital Trust III. However, this obligation does not mature until June 2038, or earlier at the option of City Holding. It is expected that City Holding will be able to obtain the necessary cash, either through dividends obtained from City National or the issuance of other debt, to fully repay the debentures at their maturity. 
    
  City National manages its liquidity position in an effort to effectively and economically satisfy the funding needs of its customers and to accommodate the scheduled repayment of borrowings. Funds are available to City National from a number of sources, including depository relationships, sales and maturities within the investment securities portfolio, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") and other financial institutions. As of   September 30, 2016  , City National s assets are significantly funded by deposits and capital. Additionally, City National maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and other financial institutions that are accessed as necessary to fund operations and to provide contingency funding mechanisms. As of   September 30, 2016  , City National has the capacity to borrow an additional   $1.6 billion   from the FHLB and other financial institutions under existing borrowing facilities. City National maintains a contingency funding plan, incorporating these borrowing facilities, to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or systemic financial industry crisis. Also, although it has no current intention to do so, City National could liquidate its unpledged securities, if necessary, to provide an additional funding source.  City National also segregates certain mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment securities in a separate subsidiary so that it can separately monitor the asset quality of these primarily mortgage-related assets, which could be used to raise cash through securitization transactions or obtain additional equity or debt financing if necessary. 
    
  The Company manages its asset and liability mix to balance its desire to maximize net interest income against its desire to minimize risks associated with capitalization, interest rate volatility, and liquidity. With respect to liquidity, the Company has chosen a conservative posture and believes that its liquidity position is strong. The Company s net loan to asset ratio is   76.0%   as of   September 30, 2016   and deposit balances fund   82.2%   of total assets. The Company has obligations to extend credit, but these obligations are primarily associated with existing home equity loans that have predictable borrowing patterns across the portfolio.  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

The Company has investment security balances with carrying values that totaled   $526.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and that greatly exceeded the Company s non-deposit sources of borrowing, which totaled   $195.9 million  .  Further, the Company s deposit mix has a very high proportion of transaction and savings accounts that fund   55.6%   of the Company s total assets. 
    
  As illustrated in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company generated   $47.8 million   of cash from operating activities during the   first nine months of 2016  , primarily from interest income received on loans and investments, net of interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings.  The Company used   $144.8 million   of cash in investing activities during the   first nine months of 2016  , primarily due to an increase in loans and net purchases of investment securities.  The Company generated   $91.7 million   of cash in financing activities during the   first nine months of 2016  , principally as a result of an increase in noninterest-bearing deposts of   $48.8   million, interest-bearing deposits of   $47.0   million, and other short-term borrowings of   $24.5   million, which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of   $19.3 million   to the Company s common stockholders and repurchases of the Company's common shares of   $10.0 million  . 

Capital Resources 
    
  During the   first nine months of 2016  , Shareholders  Equity increased   $15.5 million  , or   3.7%  , from   $419.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $434.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  This increase was primarily due to net income of    $37.5 million   and unrealized investment security gains of   $5.1 million  , that were partially offset by dividends declared of   $19.3 million   and the repurchase of the Company's stock pursuant to its stock repurchase program of   $10.0 million  . 
    
  In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published the final rules that established a new comprehensive capital framework for banking organizations, commonly referred to as Basel III.  These final rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions.  The final rule became effective January 1, 2015 for smaller, non-complex banking organizations with full implementation by January 1, 2019. 
    
  Regulatory guidelines require the Company to maintain a minimum common equity tier I ("CET1") capital ratio of 5.125% and a total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratio of 8.625%, with at least one-half of capital consisting of tangible common stockholders  equity and a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 6.625%. Similarly, City National is also required to maintain minimum capital levels as set forth by various regulatory agencies. Under capital adequacy guidelines, City National is required to maintain minimum CET1, total capital, Tier I capital, and leverage ratios of 5.125%, 8.625%, 6.625%, and 4.0%, respectively. To be classified as  well capitalized,  City National must maintain CET1, total capital, Tier I capital, and leverage ratios of 6.5%, 10.0%, 8.0%, and 5.0%, respectively. 
    
  When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require City Holding and City National to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% "capital conservation buffer" (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority's risk-adjusted measure for market risk). 
    
  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a  countercyclical capital buffer  that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to City Holding Company or City National Bank. 
    
  The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

The Company s regulatory capital ratios for both City Holding and City National are illustrated in the following tables 
  (  dollars in thousands  ): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes that City Holding Company, and its banking subsidiary, City National, were  well capitalized.   City Holding is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve, while City National is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).  Regulatory agencies can initiate certain mandatory actions if either City Holding or City National fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, as shown above.  As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes that City Holding and City National meet all capital adequacy requirements.
