of these unaudited condensed financial statements.

 (Unaudited) 

The accompanying notes are an integral part
of these unaudited condensed financial statements. 

FIRST HARVEST CORP.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1 - CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at September 30, 2016 and
for all periods presented have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's March 31, 2016 audited financial statements. The results of
operations for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 

Basis of Presentation  

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
balance sheets and related interim statements of operations and cash flows, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's
estimates and assumptions. 

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  

These unaudited condensed financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has not recognized any revenue and has accumulated operating losses of approximately $81,600 since inception.
The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements
and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. Management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating
and capital requirements of the Company. Amounts raised will be used for further development of the Company's products, to provide
financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. While
the Company is putting forth its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate
funds that will be available for operations. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might
arise from this uncertainty. 

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Earnings per Share  

The basic earnings (loss) per share is
calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares issued and outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first year for
any potentially dilutive debt or equity. 

FIRST HARVEST CORP.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 (UNAUDITED)  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company's management has evaluated
all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that
any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available,
such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has not formulated
a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

This Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect
Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify these statements by forward-looking
words such as  may,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate 
and  continue,  or similar words. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations
of us and members of our management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are
cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties,
and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  

Readers are urged
to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Important factors currently known to Management could cause actual results to differ materially from those
in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions,
the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time. We believe that our assumptions are
based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations. No assurances are made that actual results
of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions. Factors that could cause
differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for our services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and
competition.  

Business Overview  

We were incorporated on February 27, 2013
as American Riding Tours, Inc., as a Nevada corporation. On July 22, 2016, we changed our name to First Harvest Corp. We consider
ourselves to be an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company
reporting requirements. We are currently evaluating our business plan of providing motorcycle tours in order to determine whether
we need to revise or change our plan of operations. 

Results of Operations  

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we recognized no revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred total operating expenses of
$24,925, as compared to $1,500 for the same period last year. The reason for the increase in operating expenses was for additional
accounting and transfer agent fees associated with moving to a new audit firm and new transfer agent. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we had a loss from operations of $(24,925), or $(0.05) per common share basic and diluted, as compared to a
loss from operations of $(1,500), or $(0.00) per common share basic and diluted, for the same period last year. 

For
the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended September 30, 2015    

For the six months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we recognized no revenue. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred total operating expenses of $33,425,
as compared to $5,875 for the same period last year. The reason for the increase in operating expenses was for additional accounting
and transfer agent fees associated with moving to a new audit firm and new transfer agent. For the six months ended September 30,
2016, we had a loss from operations of $(33,425), or $(0.07) per common share basic and diluted, as compared to a loss from operations
of $(5,875), or $(0.02) per common share basic and diluted, for the same period last year. 

During the six months ended September 30,
2016, we used net cash of $40,468 in operations, and generated $20,725 cash from financing activities. This compares for the six
months ended September 30, 2015, where we used net cash of $5,250 in operations and generated $5,250 cash from financing activities. 

Going Concern  

Our ability to continue as a going concern
is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable
operations. 

Therefore, management plans to raise equity
capital to finance our operating and capital requirements. While we are devoting our best efforts to achieve the above plans,
there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Significant changes in the number of
employees  

As of November 1, 2016, we have one employee
who serves as our sole officer. We are dependent upon our officer for our future business development. As our operations expand
we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable
at this time. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had $0 in
cash and cash equivalents for total current assets of $0. At the same date, we had total current liabilities of $20,725. 

For the six months ended September 30,
2016, we had no revenue. Management intends to raise additional debt or equity financing to fund ongoing operations and necessary
working capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing plans will be successful or be obtained in amounts sufficient
to meet our needs. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we anticipate
generating losses and therefore may be unable to continue operations in the future. We anticipate we will require additional capital
in order to develop our business. We may use a combination of equity and/or debt instruments to fund our growth strategy or enter
into a strategic arrangement with a third party. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenue or expenses, results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Revenue Recognition : We recognize
revenue related to product sales when (i) persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists, (ii) shipment has occurred, (iii) the
fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. For the period from February 27, 2013 (inception)
to September 30, 2016, we had not recognized any revenue. 

Recent Pronouncements  

We have evaluated all the recently issued
accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and do not believe that any of these pronouncements
will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 

JOBS Act  

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act, was enacted.
Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This means
that an  emerging growth company  can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would
apply to private companies. We are electing to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we
may not comply with new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public reporting companies that are not  emerging
growth companies.  

In addition, we intend to rely on other
exemptions from reporting and disclosure requirements that are offered by the JOBS Act, including (i) an exemption from the need
to provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) an exemption from the need to comply with any PCAOB requirement regarding mandatory
audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and our financial
statements (auditor discussion and analysis). These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following our first sale of
common equity securities under an effective registration statement or until we no longer qualify as an  emerging growth company,

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not required under
Regulation S-K for  smaller reporting companies.  

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures.  

Our management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to
their costs. 

Based on our evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are
required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the  material weaknesses  described
below. 

A  material weakness 
is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls. As a result of management's review of the investigation
issues and results, and other internal reviews and evaluations, management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control
environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following: 

1)  
      lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of independent board members, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and   

2)  
      We did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to provide for adequate review of the financial statements. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.    

We do not believe the
material weaknesses described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of
operations for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee
and the lack of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future
periods. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting.  

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
