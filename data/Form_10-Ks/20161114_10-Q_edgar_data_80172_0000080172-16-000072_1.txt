NATIONAL PRESTO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

NOTE A   BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

The consolidated interim financial statements included herein are unaudited and have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )  .     I  n the opinion of management of the Company,   the consolidated interim financial statements   reflect all the adjustments   which were of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair   presentation   of the results   of   the interim periods.  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 201  5   is summarized from   audited   consolidated financial statements, but does not include all the disclosures contained therein and should be rea  d in conjunction with the 201  5    A  nnual   R  eport on Form 10-K.  Interim results for the period are not indicative of those for the year. 

NOTE B   RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods  financial statements to conform to the current period s financial statement presentation.  These reclassifications did not affect net earnings or stockholders  equity as previously reported. 

NOTE   C     EARNINGS PER SHARE    

Basic earnings per share is based on the   weighted average number of common shares   and participating securities   outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share   also   includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable  .    Unvested stock awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends whether paid or unpaid ( participating securities ), are included in the number of shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.   

NOTE D   BUSINESS SEGMENTS    

In the following summary, operating profit represents earnings before other income, principally interest income and income taxes.  The Company's segments operate discretely from each other with no shared manufacturing facilities.  Costs associated with corporate activities (such as cash and marketable securities management) and the assets associated with such activities are included within the Housewares/Small Appliances segment for all periods presented. 

6   

NOTE E - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company utilizes the methods of fair value as described in Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   to value its financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 utilizes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,   note receivable,   accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.   

NOTE F - CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES   

The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents include money market funds.  The Company deposits its cash in high quality financial institutions.  The balances, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.  Money market funds are reported at fair value determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical securities (Level 1, as defined by FASB ASC 820). 

The Company has classified all marketable securities as available-for-sale which requires the securities to be reported at   estimated   fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Highly liquid, tax-exempt variable rate demand notes with put options exercisable in three months or less are classified as marketable securities. 

7   

At   October     2  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  , cost for marketable securities was determined using the specific identification method.  A summary of the amortized costs and fair values of the Company s marketable securities at the end of the periods presented is shown in the following table.  All of the Company s marketable securities are classified as Level 2, as defined by FASB ASC 820, with fair values determined using significant other observable inputs, which include quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices of similar securities, recently executed transactions, broker quotations, and other inputs that are observable.  There were   no   transfers into or out of Level   2   during the   nine   months ended   October     2  , 201  6  . 

Proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $  1  2  ,  329  ,000   and $  3,346  ,000   for the three month periods ended   October     2  , 201  6   and   October     4  , 201  5  ,    respectively  , and totaled   $  15  ,  720  ,000   and   $  7  ,  695  ,000   for the   nine   month periods then ended, respectively  .  There were   no   gross gains or losses related to sales of marketable securities during the same periods.  Net unrealized   losses     included in other comprehensive income were $  44  ,000   and $  10  ,000   before taxes for the three month periods ended   October     2  , 201  6   and   October     4  , 201  5  ,    respectively  , and were   $  16  ,000   and   $1,000   before taxes for the   nine   month periods then ended, respectively  .    No   unrealized gains or losses were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income during the same periods. 

The contractual maturities of the marketable securities held at   October     2  , 201  6   are as follows: $  22  ,  406  ,000   within one year; $  11  ,  721  ,000   beyond one year to five years; $  6  ,  638  ,000   beyond five years to ten years, and $  25  ,  014  ,000   beyond ten years.   All of the instruments in the beyond five year ranges are variable rate demand notes which can be tendered for cash at par plus interest within   seven   days.  Despite the stated contractual maturity date, to the extent a tender is not honored, the notes become immediately due and payable. 

NOTE G   OTHER ASSETS 

Other   Assets includes prepayments that are made from time to time by the Company for certain materials used in the manufacturing process in the Housewares/Small Appliances segment.  The Company expects to utilize the prepayments and related materials over an estimated period of up to   three   years.  As of   October     2  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  ,    $  1  2  ,  505  ,000   and   $1  6  ,  254  ,000   of such prepayments, respectively, remained unused and outstanding.        At   October     2  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  ,     $  6  ,  000  ,000     of these amounts     were   included in Other Current Assets, representing the Company s best estimate of the expected utilization of the prepayments and related materials during the twelve-month periods following those dates. 

NOTE   H     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The Company is involved in largely routine litigation incidental to its business.  Management believes the ultimate outcome of the litigation will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. 

NOTE   I     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT  S 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which addresses   diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and  

8   

classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.   The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  .  ASU 2016-13 provides   guidance for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, by introducing an approach based on expected losses. The expected loss approach will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance requires a modified retrospective transition method and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .    ASU 2016-09 provides   guidance that simplifies some provisions in stock compensation accounting   for tax consequences   related to stock payments   and   amends how excess tax benefits and payments to cover the tax   liabilities of award   recipients should be classified.   ASU 2016-09 also   allow  s an entity to elect   an accounting policy for forfeitures   and revise  s   the withholding requirements for classifying stock awards as equity. Th  e   guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016  , with e  arly adoption permitted. The Company   does not expect   the adoption of   ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact   on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10):   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities.  The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company   does not expect   the adoption of ASU 2016-01   to have a material effect   on its consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  .  ASU 2015-16 requires the acquirer in a business combination to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  .  ASU 2015-11 requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  ASU 2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method, but applies to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including  

9   

interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendment may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Forward-looking statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, in the Company s 201  5   Annual Report to Shareholders, in the Proxy Statement for the annual meeting held May 1  7  , 201  6  , and in the Company s press releases and oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are certain important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made herein.  Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty. In addition to the factors discussed herein and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: consumer spending and debt levels; interest rates; continuity of relationships with and purchases by major customers; product mix; the benefit and risk of business acquisitions; competitive pressure on sales and pricing; development and market acceptance of new products; increases in material, freight/shipping, or production cost which cannot be recouped in product pricing; delays or interruptions in shipping or production; reliance on third-party suppliers in Asia; shipment of defective product which could result in product liability claims or recalls; work or labor disruptions stemming from a unionized work force; changes in government requirements, military spending, and funding of government contracts, which could result in, among other things, the modification or termination of existing contracts; dependence on subcontractors or vendors to perform as required by contract; the efficient start-up and utilization of capital equipment investments; political actions of federal and state governments which could have an impact on everything from the value of the U.S dollar vis- -vis other currencies to the availability of affordable labor and energy; and information technology system failures or security breaches.  Additional information concerning these and other factors is contained in the Company's Securities   and Exchange Commission filings.

On a consolidated basis, sales   in  creased by $  2  ,  177  ,000 (  2  %), gross profit   de  creased by $  657  ,000 (  3  %), selling and general expenses   de  creased by $  398  ,000 (  6  %),   and   intangibles amortization decreased by $  356  ,000 (  100  %).  Earnings before the provision for income taxes   in  creased by $  84  ,000 (  1  %), as did net earnings by $  193  ,000 (  2  %).  Details concerning these changes can be found in the comments by segment below. 

Housewares/Small Appliance net sales   decreased by $  3  ,  988  ,000 from $  27  ,  704  ,000 to $  23  ,  716  ,000, or   1  4  %  ,    largely due   to a decrea  se in shipments.   Defense net sales   in  creased by $  6  ,  196  ,000 from   $  44  ,  6  21  ,000 to $  50  ,  817  ,000, or   14  %, primarily reflecting a  n     in  crease in units shipped.  Absorbent Products net sales   were essentially flat  . 

Housewares/Small Appliance gross profit   de  creased $  2,445  ,000 from $  6  ,  224  ,000 to $  3  ,  779  ,0  00,   p  rimarily   reflecting     the decrease in sales mentioned above   and   higher repairs and maintenance costs.    Defense gross profit   in  creased $  934  ,000 from $  1  2  ,  700  ,000 to $1  3  ,  634  ,000,   primarily   reflecting   the   in  crease in sales mentioned above  .  Absorbent Products gross profit improved by $  854  ,000, from   $197  ,000 to $  1,051  ,000, primarily reflecting     improved operating   costs resulting f  r  om   improved efficiencies     and lower material costs  . 

Selling and general expenses for   the Housewares/Small Appliance   segment   decreased $5  72  ,0  00, primarily reflecting   lower employee benefit cost accruals of $1,319,000, partially offset by higher accruals for product liability of $546,000  .    Selling and general expenses for the Defense segment increased $  199  ,000, primarily reflecting   increased leg  al and professional costs  .        S  elling and general expenses for th  e Absorbe  nt Products segment were essentially flat. 

Intangibles amortization decreased by $  356  ,000  .     The decrease   primarily reflect  s     amortization of the customer contract intangible asset corresponding to the quarter s comparatively lower shipments of a portion of the backlog acquired   in late 2013   from DSE, Inc., one of the Company s   former   competitors in the Defense segment. The   DSE   asset acquisition is described in Note Q to the Company s 201  5   Consolidated Financial Statements on Form 10-K.

The provision for income taxes   de  creased   nominally   from $  4  ,  266  ,000 to $  4  ,  157  ,0  00.

Absorbent Products net sales increased by $  3  ,  2  03  ,000 from $  54  ,  366  ,000 to $  57  ,  569  ,000, or   6  %,   which was primarily attributable to an increase in shipments  . 

Housewares/Small Appliance gross profit decreased $  3  ,  504  ,000 from $  15  ,  477  ,000 to $  11  ,  973  ,000, primarily reflecting the decrease in sales mentioned above   and higher repairs and maintenance costs  .

Absorbent Products gross profit improved by $  3  ,  692  ,000, from   a loss of   $  297  ,000 to   a profit of    $  3  ,  395  ,000, primarily reflecting the sales increase mentioned above, improved operating costs incident to the higher sales  ,    improved efficiencies, and lower material costs  . 

Selling and general expenses for the Housewares/Small Appliance segment decreased $554,000,   primarily reflecting lower employee benefit cost accruals of   $1,363  ,000, partially offset by higher accruals for product liability   of $  404  ,000  .   Selling and general expenses for the Defense segment increased $  902  ,000, primarily reflecting a non-cash write down of the book value of equipment   of $375,000,   increased   employee   compensation   and benefit   costs   of $352,000, and increased legal and professional costs of $197,000.   Sellin  g and general expenses for   the Absorbent Products   segment   increased $1  66  ,000, primarily reflecting   increased costs related to the increase in sales. 

Intangibles amortization decreased by $  3  ,  070  ,000. The decrease primarily reflects amortization of the customer contract intangible asset corresponding to the   period   s comparatively lower shipments of a portion of the backlog acquired in late 2013 from DSE, Inc., one of the Company s former competitors in the Defense segment. The DSE asset acquisition is described in Note Q to the Company s 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements on Form 10-K. For the   nine   months   ended   October     2  , 2016 and   October     4  , 2015, the Company recorded amortization expense of $568,000 and $  3  ,  534  ,000, respectively, associated with the customer contract intangible asset. 

The   above items were responsible for the change in operating profit.  

Earnin  gs before provision for income taxes decreased $  3  ,  037  ,000 from $  38  ,  640  ,000 to $  35  ,  603  ,000.  The provision for income taxes decreased from $  13  ,  300  ,000 to $  11  ,  814  ,  000,   primarily reflecting a decrease in taxable earnings.    Net ear  nings decreased $  1,  551  ,000 from $  25  ,  340  ,000 to $  23  ,  789  ,000, or   6  %. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

N  et cash provided by operating activities was $  26  ,  614  ,000 and $  21  ,  523  ,000 for the   nine     months ended   October     2  , 201  6   and   October 4  , 201  5  , respectively.  The principal factors contributing to the   in  crease can be found in the changes in the components of working capital within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Of particular note during the first   nine   months of 201  6   were   net earnings of $  23  ,  789  ,000, which included total non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $  9  ,  958  ,000,     a decrease in accounts receivable levels stemming from cash collections on customer sales  , a net increase in payable and accrual levels  , and a decrease in deposits made with raw material suppliers included in other assets and curre  n  t assets.    These were  

12   

partially offset by   an increase in inventory lev  els.    Of particular note during the first   nine   months of 201  5   were net earnings of $  25  ,  340  ,000, which included total non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of $  11  ,  3  38  ,000,   and   a decrease in accounts receivable levels stemming from cash collections on customer sales  .    These were partially offset by increases in inventory levels and   deposits made with raw material suppliers included in other   assets and   current assets  ; and a net decrease in payable and accrual levels. 

Net cash   used in   investing activities was $  40  ,  100  ,000 during the first   nine   months of 201  6   as compared to $  7  ,  712  ,000 during the first   nine   months of 201  5  .    Of significance were   a  n increase in purchases of   marketable securities  ,    the issuance of a note receivable during 2016  ,    and the acquisition of intangible assets in the Defense segment.  These were   partially offset by a   decrease in the acquisition of pro  perty, plant, and equipment  . 

Cash flows from financing activities for the first   nine   months of 201  6   and 201  5   primarily differed as a result of the   comparative   $1.00 per share   in  crease in the extra divi  dend paid during the   2016   period.  Cash flows for both   nine  -month periods also reflected the proceeds from the sale of treasury stock to a Company sponsored retirement plan. 

Working capital   in  creased by $  2  ,  427  ,000 during the first   nine   months of 201  6   to $  2  15  ,  889  ,000 at   October     2  , 201  6   for the reasons stated above.  The Company's current ratio was   4.  9   to 1.0 at   October     2  , 201  6   and 5.  4   to 1.0 at December 31, 201  5  . 

The Company expects to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that align with its business segments and will make further acqui  sitions, as well as continue to make capital investments in these segments per existing authorized projects and for additional projects, if the appropriate return on investment is projected. 

The Company has substantial liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities to meet all of its anticipated capital requirements, to make dividend payments, and to fund future growth through acquisitions and other means.  The bulk of its marketable securities are invested in the tax exempt   variable rate demand notes described above and in   fixed rate   municipal   notes and   bonds.   The Company intends to continue its investment strategy of safety and short-term liquidity throughout its investment holdings.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.  The Company reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the Company s reported results.  These critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.   

Inventories       

New Housewares/Small Appliance product introductions are an important part of the Company s sales to offset the morbidity rate of other Housewares/Small Appliance products and/or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions.  New products entail unusual risks and have occasionally in the past resulted in losses related to obsolete or excess inventory as a result of low or diminishing demand for a product.  There were no such obsolescence issues that had a material effect during the current period, and accordingly, the Company did not record a reserve for obsolete product.  In the future should product demand issues arise, the Company may incur losses related to the obsolescence of the related inventory.  Inventory risk for the Company s other segments is not deemed to be significant, as products are largely built pursuant to customers  specific orders.   

Self-Insured Product Liability and Health Insurance 

The Company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business and is self-insured for health care costs, although it does carry stop loss and other insurance to cover claims once a health care claim reaches a specified threshold.  The Company s insurance coverage varies from policy year to policy year, and there are typically limits on all types of insurance coverage, which also vary from policy year to policy year.  Accordingly, the Company records an accrual for known claims and incurred but not reported claims, including an estimate for related legal fees in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company utilizes historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate accrual.  There  

13   

are no known claims that would have a material adverse impact on the Company beyond the reserve levels that have been accrued and recorded on the Company s books and records.  An increase in the number or magnitude of claims could have a material impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.   

Sales and Returns 

Sales are recorded net of discounts and returns.  The latter pertain primarily to warranty returns, returns of seasonal items, and returns of those newly introduced products sold with a return privilege.   The calculation of warranty returns is based in large part on historical data, while seasonal and new product returns are primarily developed using customer provided information. 

Impairment and Valuation of Long-lived Assets 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including the value of a government sales contract. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the amounts of the cash flows and the asset s residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. The Company uses internal discounted cash flows estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. The Company derives the required cash flow estimates from its historical experience and its internal business plans.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company's interest income on cash equivalents and marketable securities is affected by changes in interest rates in the United States.  Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds. Based on the accounting profession s interpretation of cash equivalents under FASB ASC Topic 230, the Company s seven-day variable rate demand notes are classified as marketable securities rather than as cash equivalents.  The demand notes are highly liquid instruments with interest rates set every   seven   days that can be tendered to the trustee or remarketer upon   seven   days notice for payment of principal and accrued interest amounts.  The   seven  -day tender feature of these variable rate demand notes is further supported by an irrevocable letter of credit from highly rated U.S. banks.  To the extent a bond is not remarketed at par plus accrued interest, the difference is drawn from the bank s letter of credit.  The Company has had no issues tendering these notes to the trustees or remarketers.  Other than a failure of a major U.S. bank, there are no risks of which the Company is aware that relate to these notes in the current market. The   balance of the Company s investments is held primarily in fixed and variable rate municipal bonds with a weighted average life of   1.  0     year.  Accordingly,   changes in interest rates have not had a material effect on the Company, and   the Company does not anticipate   that future exposure to interest rate market risk will be material.  The Company uses sensitivity analysis to determine its exposure to changes in interest rates.   

The Company has no history of, and does not anticipate in the future, investing in derivative financial instruments.  Most transactions with international customers are entered into in U.S. dollars, precluding the need for foreign currency cash flow hedges. As the majority of the Housewares/Small Appliance segment s suppliers are located in China, periodic changes in the U.S. dollar and Chinese Renminbi (RMB) exchange rates do have an impact on that segment s product costs. It is anticipated that any potential material impact from fluctuations in the exchange rate will be to the cost of products secured via purchase orders issued subsequent to the revaluation. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15   under   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  1934 Act ) as of   October     2  , 201  6  .    Based on that evaluation, t  he Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 

There were no changes to internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   October     2  , 201  6   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
