EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , combines the filings for FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated, or FelCor, and FelCor Lodging Limited Partnership, or FelCor LP.  Where it is important to distinguish between the two, we either refer specifically to FelCor or FelCor LP.  Otherwise we use the terms  we  or  our  to refer to FelCor and FelCor LP, collectively (including their consolidated subsidiaries), unless the context indicates otherwise. 
    
  FelCor is a Maryland corporation operating as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and is the sole general partner of, and the owner of a greater than 99% partnership interest in, FelCor LP.  Through FelCor LP, FelCor owns hotels and conducts business.  As the sole general partner of FelCor LP, FelCor has exclusive and complete control of FelCor LP s day-to-day management. 
    
  We believe combining periodic reports for FelCor and FelCor LP into single combined reports results in the following benefits: 

presents our business as a whole (the same way management views and operates the business); 
                
    eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation (a substantial portion of our disclosure applies to both FelCor and FelCor LP); and 
                
    saves time and cost by preparing combined reports instead of separate reports. 
       
  We operate the company as one enterprise. The employees of FelCor direct the management and operation of FelCor LP.  With sole control of FelCor LP, FelCor consolidates FelCor LP for financial reporting purposes.  FelCor has no assets other than its investment in FelCor LP and no liabilities separate from FelCor LP.  Therefore, the reported assets and liabilities for FelCor and FelCor LP are substantially identical. 
    
  The substantive difference between FelCor and FelCor LP filings is that FelCor is a REIT with publicly-traded equity, while FelCor LP is a partnership with no publicly-traded equity. This difference is reflected in the financial statements in the equity (or partners  capital) section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity (or partners  capital). Apart from the different equity treatment, the consolidated financial statements for FelCor and FelCor LP are nearly identical, except the net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in FelCor LP is deducted from FelCor s net income (loss) in order to arrive at net income (loss) attributable to FelCor common stockholders. The noncontrolling interest is included in net income (loss) attributable to FelCor LP common unitholders.  The holders of noncontrolling interests in FelCor LP are unaffiliated with FelCor, and in aggregate, hold less than 1% of the operating partnership units. 
    
  We present the sections in this report combined unless separate disclosure is required for clarity.

1. 
     Organization 
     FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated (NYSE:FCH), or FelCor, is a Maryland corporation operating as a real estate investment trust, or REIT.  FelCor is the sole general partner of, and the owner of a greater than   99.5%   partnership interest in, FelCor Lodging Limited Partnership, or FelCor LP, through which we held ownership interests in   39   hotels as of   September 30, 2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate of   138,384,179   shares and units outstanding, consisting of   137,773,996   shares of FelCor common stock and   610,183   FelCor LP units not owned by FelCor. 
  Of our   39   hotels, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   100%   interests in   36   hotels, a   95%   interest in   one   hotel (The Knickerbocker) and   50%   interests in entities owning   two   hotels.  We consolidate our real estate interests in the   37   hotels in which we hold majority interests, and we record the real estate interests of the   two   hotels in which we hold indirect   50%   interests using the equity method.  We lease   38   of the   39   hotels to our taxable REIT subsidiaries, of which we own a controlling interest.  We operate   one     50%   owned hotel without a lease.  Because we own controlling interests in our operating lessees, we consolidate our interests in all   38   leased hotels (which we refer to as our Consolidated Hotels) and reflect their operating revenues and expenses in our statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  We own   50%   of the real estate interest in   one   Consolidated Hotel (we account for our real estate interest in this hotel by the equity method) and majority real estate interests in our remaining   37   Consolidated Hotels (we consolidate our real estate interests in these hotels). 
  The following table illustrates the distribution by brand of our   38   Consolidated Hotels at   September 30, 2016  : 

At   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Hotels were located in   14   states, with concentrations in California (  10   hotels), Florida (  six   hotels) and Massachusetts (  three   hotels).  We generated approximately   56%   of our revenue from hotels in these   three   states during the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , of our Consolidated Hotels: (i) subsidiaries of Hilton Worldwide managed   20   hotels; (ii) subsidiaries of Wyndham Worldwide managed   eight   hotels; (iii) subsidiaries of Marriott International managed   four   hotels; (iv) subsidiaries of InterContinental Hotels Group managed   one   hotel; (v) Fairmont, a subsidiary of AccorHotels Group, managed   one   hotel; (vi) a subsidiary of Highgate Hotels managed   one   hotel; (vii) a subsidiary of Morgans Hotel Group Corporation managed   two   hotels; and (viii) Aimbridge Hospitality managed   one   hotel.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.    Organization   (continued) 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted accounting guidance under Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-2, modifying the analysis performed to determine whether we should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities  VIEs  or voting interest model entities.  The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model.  Under the revised guidance, FelCor LP is a variable interest entity of FelCor. As FelCor LP is already consolidated in the balance sheets of FelCor, the identification of this entity as a variable interest entity has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of FelCor.  There were no other legal entities under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption. 
  The information in our consolidated financial statements for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is unaudited.  Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The accompanying financial statements for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , include adjustments based on management s estimates (consisting of normal and recurring accruals), which we consider necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods. The financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of actual operating results for the entire year. 

2. 
    Investment in Unconsolidated Entities 
     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned   50%   interests in joint ventures that owned   two   hotels.  We also own   50%   interests in entities that own real estate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and provide condominium management services at these locations.  We account for our investments in these unconsolidated entities under the equity method.  We consolidate all of our majority-owned subsidiaries in our financial statements.  We make adjustments to our equity in income from unconsolidated entities related to the difference between our basis in investment in unconsolidated entities compared to the historical basis of the assets recorded by the joint ventures. 
  The following table summarizes combined balance sheet information for our unconsolidated entities (in thousands): 

Our unconsolidated entities  debt at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 consisted entirely of non-recourse mortgage debt.

    Investment in Unconsolidated Entities   (continued) 
     In May 2015,   one   of our joint ventures sold a hotel, resulting in a   $7.1 million   gain that we included in our equity in income from unconsolidated entities.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Consolidated debt consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): 

(a) 
    This debt is comprised of separate non-cross-collateralized loans, each secured by a mortgage encumbering different hotels. 
              (b) 
    Our line of credit can be extended for   one   year, subject to satisfying certain conditions.  We may borrow up to   $400 million   under our line of credit. 
              (c) 
    This loan can be extended   for   one   year, subject to satisfying certain conditions. 
     Since adoption of ASU 2015-03, we classify deferred financing costs of   $16.5 million   and   $18.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, within the debt on our consolidated balance sheets.  We previously classified deferred financing costs of   $18.1 million   at December 31, 2015 as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets.  In accordance with ASU 2015-15, we continue classifying deferred financing costs associated with our line of credit as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets.                   

We reported   $19.4 million   and   $19.6 million   of interest expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which is net of: (i) interest income of   $18,000   and   $6,000   and (ii) capitalized interest of   $293,000   and   $565,000  , respectively.  We reported   $59.1 million   and   $59.4 million   of interest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which is net of: (i) interest income of   $46,000   and   $18,000   and (ii) capitalized interest of   $640,000   and   $5.6 million  , respectively.

    FelCor Capital Stock/FelCor LP Partners  Capital 
       
  FelCor repurchased and retired   4.6 million   shares of common stock for   $30.5 million   (including commissions) for an average price of   $6.58   per share during the first nine months of 2016.  Since FelCor s Board of Directors authorized the current   $100 million   repurchase program, FelCor has repurchased   6.6 million   shares of common stock for   $44.8 million   (including commissions) for an average price of   $6.78   per share.   
    
  In April 2015, FelCor issued   18.4 million   shares of its common stock at   $11.25   per share in a public offering. FelCor contributed the net proceeds from the offering (  $199 million  ) to FelCor LP in exchange for   18.4 million   common units of limited partnership interests. 
    
  In April 2015, FelCor called for redemption of all of its outstanding shares of   8%   Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or the Series C Preferred Stock, and all depositary shares representing the Series C Preferred Stock.  FelCor redeemed those shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the depositary shares, and FelCor LP concurrently redeemed its Series C Preferred Units, on May 14, 2015 using proceeds from the equity offering.  Including dividends of   $491,000  , the total redemption price was   $170.4 million  .  We reduced income available to common stockholders (unitholders) by   $6.1 million     for the     nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily representing the original issuance costs (  $5.5 million  ) and discount (  $538,000  ) of the redeemed Series C Preferred Stock (Units).

Nearly all of our revenue is comprised of hotel operating revenue.  This revenue is recorded net of any sales or occupancy taxes collected from our guests.  We record all rebates or discounts, when allowed, as a reduction in revenue, and there are no material contingent obligations with respect to rebates or discounts offered by us.  All revenues are recorded on an accrual basis, as earned.  We make appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts, which we record as bad debt expense.  We derive the remainder of our revenue from condominium management fee income and other sources.

    Impairment Charges 
     Our hotels are comprised of operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished, operationally, and for financial reporting purposes, from the remainder of our operations.  Accordingly, we consider our hotels to be components for purposes of determining impairment charges. 
  We test for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate a hotel s carrying value may not be recoverable.  We conduct the test using undiscounted cash flows for the shorter of the hotel s estimated hold period or its remaining useful life.  When testing for recoverability of hotels held for investment, we use projected cash flows over its expected hold period.  Those hotels held for investment that fail the impairment test are written down to their then current estimated fair value, before any selling expense, and we continue to depreciate the hotels over their remaining useful lives. 
  In September 2016, we recorded a   $20.1 million   impairment charge for a hotel.  The impairment charge was primarily based on both third-party offers to purchase the hotel and observable market data on a price per room basis from transactions involving hotels in similar locations (a Level 2 input under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements).  
  In June 2016, we recorded a   $6.3 million   impairment charge for a hotel subsequently sold in the third quarter of 2016.  The impairment charge was based on an accepted third-party offer to purchase the hotel (a Level 2 input under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements) at a price below our previously estimated fair market value for the property. In the third quarter of 2015, we determined that this hotel no longer met our investment criteria, and we recorded a   $20.9 million   impairment charge for this hotel at that time.  The 2015 impairment charge was determined using Level 3 input under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements.  For this estimate, we used a discounted cash flow analysis with an estimated stabilized growth rate of   3%  , a discounted cash flow term of   5 years  , a terminal capitalization rate of   8%  , and a discount rate of   11%  . 
  We may record additional impairment charges if operating results of individual hotels are materially different from our forecasts, the economy and lodging industry weakens, or we shorten our contemplated holding period for additional hotels.   

8. 
    Hotel Dispositions  
     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   two   hotels (both of which were sold in the third quarter), and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold   eight   hotels.  We included operations for the sold hotels in income (loss) from continuing operations as shown in the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and    2015  , as disposition of these hotels did not represent a strategic shift in our business. Additionally, we included selling costs, which we expense as they are incurred, in the gain (loss) on the sale of hotels. 
  We designate a hotel as held for sale when the sale is probable within the next twelve months.  Generally, we consider a sale to be probable when a buyer completes its due diligence review, we have an executed contract for sale and we have received a substantial non-refundable deposit.  There were no hotels held for sale at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

  We grant our executive officers restricted stock units each year, which provides them with the potential to earn shares of our common stock in   three   increments over   three   to   four years  .  A portion of the actual number of shares that vest is determined based on total stockholder return relative to a group of   ten   lodging REIT peers, and a portion is related to service.  We amortize the fixed cost of these grants over the vesting periods. We calculate the potential dilutive impact of these awards on our earnings per share using the treasury stock method.

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
       
  We base disclosures about fair value of our financial instruments on pertinent information available to management as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  We exercise considerable judgment when interpreting market data and developing estimated fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize on disposition of the financial instruments.  Different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value amounts. 
    
  We base our estimates of the fair value of: (i) cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses on their carrying values due to their relatively short maturity; (ii) our debt for which trading prices are publicly available on observable market data (a Level 2 input) (that debt had an estimated fair value of   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ); and (iii) our debt for which trading prices are not publicly available on a discounted cash flow model using effective borrowing rates for debt with similar terms, loan to estimated fair value of collateral and remaining maturities (a Level 3 input) (that debt had an estimated fair value of   $354.3 million   and   $438.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively).  The estimated fair value of all our debt was   $1.4 billion   and   $1.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The carrying value of our debt was   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in FelCor LP/Redeemable Units 
     We record redeemable noncontrolling interests in FelCor LP, in the case of FelCor, and redeemable units, in the case of FelCor LP, in the mezzanine section (between liabilities and equity or partners  capital) of our consolidated balance sheets because of the redemption feature of these units.  Additionally, FelCor s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) separately present earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.  We adjust redeemable noncontrolling interests in FelCor LP (or redeemable units) each period to reflect the greater of its carrying value based on the accumulation of historical cost or its redemption value.  We base the historical cost on the proportionate relationship between the carrying value of equity associated with FelCor s common stockholders relative to that of FelCor LP s unitholders.  We base redemption value on the closing price of FelCor s common stock at period end.  FelCor allocates net income (loss) to FelCor LP s noncontrolling partners based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period.

  Our joint venture that redeveloped The Knickerbocker raised   $45 million   through the sale of redeemable preferred equity under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program.  The purchasers receive a   3.25%   current annual return (which increases to   8%   if we do not redeem this equity interest before the fifth anniversary of its issuance), plus a   0.25%   non-compounding annual return payable at redemption.  To date, the venture has received   $44.4 million   in gross proceeds (  $43.8 million   net of issuance costs), including   $600,000   and   $1.8 million   in gross proceeds received in the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The venture will receive the remaining   $600,000   as investors  visas are approved.  
   
  13.    Commercial Dispute 
    
  One   of our consolidated subsidiaries was engaged in a commercial dispute with a third party.  Under generally accepted accounting principles, we recorded   $5.9 million   in other expenses during the third quarter of 2014 to establish a provision for our estimate of our maximum exposure for this contingency.  We paid the disputed amount in January 2015 but continued asserting our contractual rights.  In June 2015, we settled the commercial dispute and recovered   $3.7 million   (net of legal costs), which we have recorded in other revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

14.    Contingency 
  In April 2016, an affiliate of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC, or IHG, which had formerly operated   three   hotels on our behalf (  two   of which we sold in 2006, and   one   of which we converted to Wyndham operation and brand in 2013), notified us that the pension fund in which the employees at those hotels had participated has assessed   $8.3 million   in withdrawal liability in connection with the termination of IHG s operation of those hotels.  Under our hotel management agreements with IHG, we may be obligated to indemnify and hold IHG harmless for some or all of any amount ultimately contributed to the pension fund with respect to these hotels. 
  Because of the rules and regulations governing the pension trust, we have paid   $854,000   to the pension trust for the last three calendar quarters and expect to continue making such payments, on a quarterly basis, while the dispute is ongoing, subject to an overall contribution limit corresponding to the amount sought by the pension trust.  While we aggressively oppose the pension trust s position, we believe that resolution of this matter may take as long as   two   more years.  Accordingly, we have recorded the payments made to date (  $854,000  , in total) and accrued for   eight   more quarterly payments that would be made if the dispute remains unresolved for another   two   years (approximately   $2.3 million  ) as a loss on the sale of hotels included in discontinued operations because it primarily relates to hotels sold prior to 2013. 
  Despite these payments and accruals, we believe that (i) the pension trust was in error in assessing the withdrawal liability in this situation and (ii) even if the pension trust was not in error, we are not responsible for a significant portion (or perhaps any) of the withdrawal liability assessed by the pension trust for other reasons and that we are likely to recover a significant portion (if not all) of what we have paid, and may pay in the future, to the pension trust with respect to its claim. Consequently, we are vigorously disputing the underlying claims and, if appropriate, IHG s demand for indemnification.  The matter involves significant legal, actuarial and factual analysis with respect to each hotel, and we have not determined whether any loss to us is probable or that any such loss is estimable (other than the payments and accrual noted in the previous paragraph, for which we intend to seek recovery). 

15  .    Severance 
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded severance charges of   $6.1 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively.  The charges are included in other expenses and primarily relate to FelCor s former Chief Executive Officer for 2016 and certain other officers for 2015. 

16.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. 
  Additionally, this guidance requires improved disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date (for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016).  We are evaluating what impact (if any) ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position or results of operations.

16.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards        (continued) 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors).  The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.  This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The ASU is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as we have certain operating lease arrangements.  ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases.  The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions.  Under the new standard, companies can withhold shares up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction as participants vest in stock and maintain equity classification of the entire award.   Also under the new standard, forfeitures for stock awards may be recorded when they occur (the prior guidance required estimating forfeitures when recording stock compensation costs).  Finally, the standard requires classifying cash paid when remitting cash to the tax authorities for stock compensation withholding as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.  We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016.  Upon adoption, we revised our policy to account for stock compensation forfeitures as they occur, which resulted in a   $185,000   increase in our accumulated deficit for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.  In addition, in our statement of cash flows, we will reclassify   $2.1 million   and   $3.1 million   of cash paid to taxing authorities for shares withheld from operating activities to financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 
  Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, for our   37   same-store hotels (which excludes The Knickerbocker) decreased   0.7%   in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, driven by a   1.3%   decrease in occupancy, offset by a   0.6%   increase in average daily rate, or ADR. 
  In our continuing effort to increase long-term stockholder value, we look for opportunities to redeploy capital to achieve higher returns and strengthen our balance sheet.  In accordance with our 2015 strategic plan, our Board approved selling five hotels.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold two hotels, the Renaissance Esmeralda Indian Wells Resort and the Holiday Inn Nashville Airport for $76 million and $32 million, respectively.  We used proceeds from the sales to repay our line of credit.  We continue to market our three New York hotels for sale. 
  In 2015, our Board approved a common stock repurchase program, under which we may spend up to $100 million repurchasing shares of our common stock through October 2017.  We may repurchase shares in transactions on the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or by other means, including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions.  During the first nine months of 2016, we repurchased   4.6 million   shares of common stock for   $30.5 million   (including commissions) for an average price of   $6.58   per share.  Since FelCor s Board of Directors authorized the current repurchase program, we have repurchased   6.6 million   shares of common stock for   $44.8 million   (including commissions) at an average price of   $6.78   per share.  

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of the   Three   Months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net loss of   $4.9 million   compared to an   $8.1 million   net loss for the same period last year.  Our 2016 net loss includes a $20.1 million impairment charge for one hotel and a $6.1 million severance charge, primarily related to the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by a $4.9 million net gain on the sale of hotels (including a $3.1 million loss in discontinued operations).  Our 2015 net loss included a   $20.9 million   impairment charge for a hotel subsequently sold in 2016 and $3.6 million in severance charges for certain FelCor officers, partially offset by a $3.6 million net gain on hotel sales (including $491,000 in discontinued operations). 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    Hotel operating revenue   decreased   $2.3 million  , which includes a $4.0 million net reduction in revenue for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, hotel operating revenue increased $1.7 million from last year.  We attribute this increase primarily to improved food and beverage operations, primarily in the banquet and catering department, and an increase in revenue from other sources such as parking and resort fees.  This increase is partially offset by a reduction in room revenue as a result of a   0.7%     decrease   in same-store RevPAR. 
                
    Hotel departmental expenses   decreased   $2.4 million  , which includes a $2.9 million net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, hotel departmental expenses represented 33.4% of hotel operating revenue for both periods. 
                
    Other property-related costs   decreased   $3.0 million  , including a $2.1 million net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, other  
     
    33 

property-related costs decreased slightly to 23.5% of hotel operating revenue from 24.1% last year, primarily attributable to cost containment initiatives implemented in the current period. 
             
    Management and franchise fees   decreased   $1.1 million  , including a $496,000 net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, these costs decreased slightly to 3.8% of hotel operating revenue from 4.1% last year, primarily attributable to a decline in Wyndham management fees resulting from its guaranty. 
                
    Taxes, insurance and lease expense   increased   $2.4 million  , including a $434,000 net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, these expenses increased to 7.2% of hotel operating revenue from 5.8% last year.  We attribute this increase primarily to the successful resolution of property tax appeals last year. 
                
    Corporate expenses   increased   $1.6 million  , resulting primarily from a change in stock compensation expense associated with variable stock awards.  Our stock price increased slightly within the current year period compared to a decline during the same period last year. 
                 
    Impairment   was   $20.1 million   as compared to   $20.9 million   in 2015.  The 2016 charge was based on a reduction in the fair value of one hotel resulting from third-party offers to purchase the hotel and observable market data for hotels in similar locations.  Our 2015 impairment charge resulted from a reduced estimated hold period for a hotel subsequently sold in 2016. 
                
    Other expenses   increased   $1.8 million   from the same period last year.  We attribute this change primarily to a higher severance expense incurred in the current period compared to last year, offset by a decline in pre-opening charges primarily related to The Knickerbocker. 
                
    Net interest expense   decreased   $174,000  .  We completed certain renovation and redevelopment projects, including The Knickerbocker, in 2015, resulting in less capitalized interest in the current year as compared to the same period last year.  Excluding the change in capitalized interest, interest expense declined by $446,000. 
                
    Equity in income from unconsolidated entities   increased   $493,000  , resulting primarily from completing renovations at one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, which experienced a displacement-related reduction in revenue during renovations in 2015. 
                
    Income tax   decreased $1.3 million.  Taxes in the same period last year were higher due to changes in state apportionment factors. 
                
    Discontinued operations   for both periods includes adjustments to gains and losses for hotels sold prior to December 31, 2013. 
     Comparison of the   Nine   Months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net income of   $3.8 million  , compared to net income of   $616,000   for the same period last year.  Our 2016 net income includes  $26.5 million   in impairment charges for two hotels (one of which was sold in 2016) and a $6.1 million severance charge, primarily related to the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by a $3.5 million net gain on hotel sales (including a $3.1 million loss in discontinued operations).  Our 2015 net income included debt extinguishment charges of   $30.9 million   and a   $20.9 million   impairment charge for a hotel subsequently sold in 2016, partially offset by a net gain on hotel sales of  
  
    34 

$19.9 million (including $407,000 in discontinued operations) and $3.7 million in net revenue attributable to a favorable settlement of a commercial dispute.  Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, one of our unconsolidated joint ventures sold a hotel, the gain from which increased our equity in income from unconsolidated entities by $7.1 million. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    Hotel operating revenue   decreased   $5.4 million  , including an $18.3 million net reduction in revenue for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, hotel operating revenue increased 2.2% from last year.  We attribute the increase primarily to the   1.7%     increase   in same-store RevPAR, reflecting a   2.0%     increase   in ADR offset by a   0.2%     decrease   in occupancy. In the current period, certain hotels also experienced improved food and beverage operations, primarily in the banquet and catering department, and an increase in revenue for other hotel departments.   
                
    Other revenue   decreased   $3.5 million  , resulting primarily from a favorable $3.7 million net settlement of a commercial dispute in 2015. 
                
    Hotel departmental expenses   decreased   $1.3 million  , which includes a $5.8 million net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, hotel departmental expenses represented 34.0% of hotel operating revenue for both periods. 
                
    Other property-related costs   decreased   $6.1 million  , including an $8.1 million net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, other property-related costs decreased slightly to 24.3% of hotel operating revenue from 24.5% for the same period last year. 
                
    Management and franchise fees   decreased   $1.7 million  , including a $1.6 million net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, these costs are 3.9% of hotel operating revenue compared to 4.0% for the same period last year. 
                
    Taxes, insurance and lease expense   decreased   $345,000  , including a $3.4 million net reduction in expense for hotels that have been disposed of or recently opened.  Excluding these hotels, these expenses increased to 6.9% of hotel operating revenue from 6.6% last year.  We attribute this increase primarily to the successful resolution of property tax appeals last year. 
                
    Corporate expenses   increased   $916,000  , resulting primarily from professional recruiting fees for directors and a company officer in the current year and a change in stock compensation expense associated with variable stock awards.  Our stock price decreased slightly within the current year period compared to a more significant decline during the same period last year. 
                
    Depreciation and amortization expense   increased   $1.1 million  , resulting primarily from depreciation of The Knickerbocker after the hotel was placed in service during 2015, partially offset by depreciation of hotels sold in 2015 and 2016. 
                
    Impairment   was   $26.5 million   compared to   $20.9 million   in the same period in the prior year.  The 2016 charge is comprised of a reduction in the fair value of one hotel resulting from third-party offers to purchase the hotel and observable market data for hotels in similar locations, in addition to a charge     resulting from an accepted third-party offer to purchase a hotel sold in the current year.  The 2015 charge   resulted from reducing the estimated hold period for a hotel subsequently sold in 2016.  
                
    Other expenses   decreased   $895,000   from the same period last year.  We attribute this change primarily to pre-opening costs incurred in 2015 for The Knickerbocker, partially offset by an increase in expense for a litigation settlement, an increase in abandoned project charges and higher severance expense incurred in the current year compared to the prior year. 
     
    35 

Net interest expense   decreased   $306,000  .  We completed certain renovation and redevelopment projects, including The Knickerbocker, in 2015 resulting in lower capitalized interest in the current year as compared to the same period last year.  Excluding the change in capitalized interest, interest expense declined by $5.3 million. 
                
    Debt extinguishment   charges were zero, compared to   $30.9 million   in 2015 (which included a $10.5 million write-off of deferred loan costs), primarily related to redeeming our 6.75% senior secured notes. 
                
    Equity in income from unconsolidated entities   decreased   $6.6 million  , primarily reflecting the 2015 gain on sale of a hotel owned by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by improved operations at one of our unconsolidated joint ventures resulting from completing renovations which experienced a displacement-related reduction in 2015. 
                
    Income tax   decreased $1.2 million.  Taxes in the same period last year were higher due to changes in state apportionment factors. 
                
    Discontinued operations   for both periods includes adjustments to gains and losses for hotels sold prior to December 31, 2013.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We refer in this report to certain  non-GAAP financial measures.   These measures, including FFO (Funds from Operations), Adjusted FFO, EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), Adjusted EBITDA, Same-store Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA margin, are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.  Immediately following the reconciliations, we include a discussion of why we believe these measures are useful supplemental measures of our performance and the limitations of such measures. 
  Reconciliation of Net Loss to FFO and Adjusted FFO 
  (in thousands, except per share data) 

* FFO and Adjusted FFO are attributable to FelCor common stockholders and FelCor LP common unitholders other than FelCor.

Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin 
  (dollars in thousands) 

40 

Reconciliation of Same-store Operating Revenue and Same-store Operating Expense to Total Revenue, Total Operating Expense and Operating Income 
  (in thousands) 

(a) 
    Under GAAP, we include the operating performance for disposed, held for sale and recently-opened hotels in continuing operations in our statements of operations.  However, for purposes of our Non-GAAP reporting metrics, we have excluded the results of these hotels to provide a meaningful same-store comparison.  
              (b) 
    Consolidated hotel lease expense represents the lease expense of our 51% owned operating lessees.  The offsetting lease revenue is included in equity in income from unconsolidated entities. 
     Substantially all of our non-current assets consist of real estate. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance, which are not measures of operating performance under GAAP, to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations. These supplemental measures are not measures of operating performance under GAAP.  However, we consider these non-GAAP measures to be supplemental measures of a hotel REIT s performance and should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income (loss) attributable to FelCor as a measure of our operating performance. 

41 

FFO and EBITDA 
    
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or  NAREIT,  defines FFO as net income or loss attributable to parent (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.  FFO for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT. This may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 
    
  EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. We define EBITDA as net income or loss attributable to parent (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect EBITDA on the same basis. 
    
  Adjustments to FFO and EBITDA 
  We adjust FFO and EBITDA when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted FFO, and Adjusted EBITDA when combined with GAAP net income (loss) attributable to FelCor, EBITDA and FFO, is beneficial to an investor s better understanding of our operating performance.  
             
    Gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps -   We exclude gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps from Adjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that it is not indicative of ongoing operating performance of our hotel assets.  This also represents an acceleration of interest expense or a reduction of interest expense, and interest expense is excluded from EBITDA. 
                
    Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle   - Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  We exclude these one-time adjustments in computing Adjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period. 
                
    Other expenses and costs -   From time to time, we periodically incur expenses or transaction costs that are not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  Such costs include, but are not limited to, conversion costs, acquisition costs, pre-opening costs, severance costs and certain non-cash adjustments.  We exclude these costs from the calculation of Adjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA. 

Variable stock compensation   - We exclude the cost associated with our variable stock compensation.  This cost is subject to volatility related to the price and dividends of our common stock that does not necessarily correspond to our operating performance. 
     In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses on the sale of depreciable assets and impairment losses because including them in EBITDA is inconsistent with reporting the   ongoing   performance of our remaining assets.  Additionally, the gain or loss on sale of depreciable assets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA.  We also exclude the amortization of our fixed stock and directors  compensation, which is included in corporate expenses and is not separately stated on our statements of operations.  Excluding amortization of our fixed stock and directors  compensation maintains consistency with the EBITDA definition. 
  
    42 

Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin 
  Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and brand/managers have direct control.  We believe that Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures that we use in our financial and operational decision-making.  Additionally, using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners.  We present Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA margin in a manner consistent with Adjusted EBITDA, however, we also eliminate all revenues and expenses from continuing operations not directly associated with hotel operations, including other income and corporate-level expenses.  We eliminate these additional items because we believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information regarding the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management on a property-level basis.  We also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities, which is effectively eliminated by noncontrolling interests and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes, insurance and lease expense, to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our Consolidated Hotels.  Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA margins are presented on a same-store basis. 
  Use and Limitations of Non-GAAP Measures 
  We use FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Same-store Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other hotel REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies.  We use Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA margin in evaluating hotel-level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers. 
  The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations.  As we present them, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures as presented by other real estate companies.  These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures.  We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance.  Our reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. 
  These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.  They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP.  These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure.  We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Operating Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , RevPAR at our same-store hotels increased   1.7%  , as compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a   2.0%   increase in ADR and offset by a   0.2%   decline in occupancy.  We expect our RevPAR will increase 1.25% to 1.5% during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily from higher ADR, and our operations will generate $146 million to $150 million of cash flow this year. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $50.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents, including   $30.6 million   held by third-party management companies.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , our operations (primarily hotel operations) provided   $114.0 million   in cash, which is consistent with the same period last year.  
  Investing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash provided by investing activities was   $38.6 million   as compared to cash provided by investing activities of   $125.0 million   last year.  In 2016, we sold hotels for   $101.7 million   in aggregate net proceeds compared to   $190.0 million   in aggregate net proceeds received during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Additionally, in 2015 we sold a hotel owned by an unconsolidated joint venture resulting in higher distributions last year. 
  During 2016, we plan to invest approximately $60 million in renovations as part of our long-term capital plan.  In addition, we expect to invest approximately $15 million in redevelopment projects this year.  Through September 30, we have spent   $15.3 million   more this year on renovation and redevelopment projects at our hotels than last year.  In 2015, we completed developing The Knickerbocker.  Accordingly, we spent   $31.6 million   on the development of that hotel during the first   nine   months of 2015 as we wound down that project.  After winding down The Knickerbocker and other capital projects, less interest was capitalized in the current period as compared to the same period last year.  In September 2016, we acquired land under one of our hotels for   $8.2 million  , including closing costs.  We had previously leased the land from the prior owners. 
  Financing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash used in financing activities was   $162.1 million  ,   $67.0 million   less than cash used in financing activities for the same period last year.  The following financing transactions took place during the first nine months of 2015: 
             
    We issued our $475 million 6% senior notes (resulting in deferred financing fees of $8.5 million) and used the proceeds, in addition to cash on hand, to repurchase and redeem our $525 million (face value) 6.75% senior notes; 
                
    We amended and restated our line of credit (resulting in deferred financing fees of $5.8 million) and used funds drawn on the line of credit to repay a $140 million secured loan; 
                
    We repaid $62.1 million of secured debt using sale proceeds; 
                
    We issued 18.4 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $199 million; 
                
    We used proceeds from selling our common stock to redeem all of our outstanding shares of 8% Series C preferred stock for an aggregate redemption price of $170.4 million (including $491,000 of accrued dividends); 
     
    48 

We received $1.7 million of additional net proceeds from selling preferred equity interests pursuant to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program by The Knickerbocker consolidated joint venture; and 
                
    We increased our distributions to noncontrolling interest holders to $16.3 million primarily due to selling a hotel in a consolidated joint venture. 
     We implemented a stock repurchase program in December 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, we repurchased   4.6 million   shares of common stock for   $30.5 million   (including commissions) at an average price of   $6.58   per share. 
  In 2016, we expect to make approximately $3 million of scheduled principal payments and pay $25 million of preferred dividends and $33 million in common dividends (assuming no change to our current quarterly dividend), all of which will be funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand.  We also expect to use proceeds from selling hotels to repay debt, repurchase common stock and take advantage of future value-creation opportunities. 
  FelCor LP, which is our operating partnership, distributes funds to FelCor to pay common and preferred dividends.  Our Board determines the amount of common and preferred dividends for each quarter, if any, based upon various factors including operating results, economic conditions, other operating trends, our financial condition and capital requirements, as well as the minimum REIT distribution requirements. 
  Except for our 5.625% senior secured notes due 2023 and our line of credit, our secured debt is generally recourse solely to the specific hotels securing the debt, except in case of fraud, misapplication of funds and certain other customary limited recourse carve-out provisions that could extend recourse to us.  Much of our secured debt allows us to substitute collateral under certain conditions and is freely prepayable, subject in some instances to various prepayment, yield maintenance or defeasance obligations. 
  Most of our secured debt (other than our 5.625% senior secured notes) is subject to lock-box arrangements under certain circumstances.  We are permitted to spend an amount required to cover our hotel operating expenses, taxes, debt service, insurance and capital expenditure reserves, even if revenues are flowing through a lock-box triggered by a specified debt service coverage ratio not being met.  All of our consolidated loans subject to lock-box provisions currently exceed the applicable minimum debt service coverage ratios. 
  Senior Notes.    Our senior notes, which are guaranteed by FelCor, require that we satisfy total leverage, secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to: (i) incur additional indebtedness, except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt, as defined under our indentures; (ii) pay dividends in excess of the minimum distributions required to qualify as a REIT; (iii) repurchase capital stock; or (iv) merge.  We currently exceed all minimum thresholds.  In addition, our 5.625% senior secured notes are secured by a combination of first lien mortgages and related security interests on nine hotels, as well as pledges of equity interests in certain subsidiaries of FelCor LP, and our 6.0% senior unsecured notes require us to maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered assets. 
  Interest Rate Caps.    To fulfill requirements under one of our loans, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $140 million at   December 31, 2015  .  We did not designate the interest rate cap as a hedge, and it had an insignificant fair value at   December 31, 2015  , resulting in no impact on earnings.  We had no outstanding interest rate caps at   September 30, 2016  . 
  
    49 

Inflation and Competition 
  Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation.  Competitive pressures may, however, require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future.  We are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses that are disproportionate to increases in revenues.  If competition requires us to reduce room rates or limits our ability to raise room rates in the future, we may not be able to adjust our room rates to reflect the effects of inflation in full, in which case our operating results and liquidity could be adversely affected. 

Seasonality 
    
  The lodging business is seasonal in nature.  Generally, hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters, although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations.  Revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year. Seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues.  Quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.  To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations.

    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function): 
              a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
