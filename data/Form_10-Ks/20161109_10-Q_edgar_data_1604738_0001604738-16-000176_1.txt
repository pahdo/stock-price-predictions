1. Organization and Description of Business 
  Ashford Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on April 2, 2014, subsequently reincorporated in Maryland (see note 13), that provides asset management and advisory services to Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. ( Ashford Trust ) and Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. ( Ashford Prime ). Ashford Trust commenced operating in August 2003 and is focused on investing in full service hotels in the upscale and upper-upscale segments in the U.S. that have revenue per available room ( RevPAR ) generally less than twice the national average. Ashford Prime invests primarily in luxury, upper-upscale and upscale hotels with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average in gateway and resort locations. Ashford Prime became a publicly traded company in November 2013 upon the completion of its spin-off from Ashford Trust. Each of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, and the common stock of each of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime is traded on the NYSE. The common stock of Ashford Inc. is listed on the NYSE MKT Exchange. 
  Ashford Inc. was formed through a spin-off of Ashford Trust s asset management business in November 2014. The spin-off was completed by means of a distribution of common stock of Ashford Inc. and common units of Ashford Hospitality Advisors LLC ( Ashford LLC ), a Delaware limited liability company formed on April 5, 2013. Following the spin-off, Ashford Trust continues to hold approximately   598,000   shares of Ashford Inc. common stock for the benefit of its common stockholders, which represents an approximate   30%   ownership interest in Ashford Inc. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into an advisory agreement with Ashford Trust. 
  Ashford Investment Management, LLC ( AIM ) is an indirect subsidiary of the Company, established to serve as an investment adviser to any private securities funds sponsored by us or our affiliates (the  Funds ) and is a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). AIM REHE Funds GP, LP ( AIM GP ), or an affiliate of AIM GP, serves as the general partner of any Funds. AIM Management Holdco, LLC ( Management Holdco ) owns   100%   of AIM. We, through Ashford LLC, own   100%   of Management Holdco. AIM Performance Holdco, LP ( Performance Holdco ) owns   99.99%   of AIM GP with the remaining   0.01%   general partner interest owned by our wholly owned subsidiary, AIM General Partner, LLC. We, through Ashford LLC and our   100%   ownership interest in AIM General Partner, LLC, own approximately   60%   of Performance Holdco, and Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, and Mr. J. Robison Hays, III, our chief strategy officer and a member of our board of directors, own, in the aggregate,   40%   of Performance Holdco. AIM, AIM GP, Management Holdco, Performance Holdco and AIM General Partner, LLC are all consolidated by Ashford Inc. as it has control. 
  AIM currently serves as investment adviser to AIM Real Estate Hedged Equity Master Fund, L.P. (the  Master Fund ), an investment partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands and commenced operations on January 15, 2015. The Master Fund was organized for the purpose of purchasing, selling (including short sales), investing and trading in investments and engaging in financial transactions, including borrowing, financing, pledging, hedging and other derivative transactions. The Master Fund had two limited partners: AIM Real Estate Hedged Equity (U.S.) Fund, L.P. (the  U.S. Fund ), a U.S. investment limited partnership, and AIM Real Estate Hedged Equity (Cayman) Fund, Ltd. (the  Offshore Fund ), a Cayman Islands exempted investment company (collectively, the  Feeder Funds ). The Feeder Funds invest substantially all of their assets in the Master Fund. The Master Fund is managed by AIM GP and AIM. On February 23, 2016 the board of directors of the Offshore Fund, in consultation with AIM, resolved to wind down the Offshore Fund due to the administrative cost of running the Offshore Fund relative to invested capital. All investments in the Offshore Fund were redeemed on February 29, 2016. The Master Fund and the U.S. Fund continue to operate, but under new names    Ashford Quantitative Alternatives Master Fund, LP  (the  AQUA Master Fund ) and  Ashford Quantitative Alternatives (U.S.), LP  (the  AQUA U.S. Fund ), respectively, effective March 1, 2016. The AQUA Master Fund and the AQUA U.S. Fund are collectively known as the  AQUA Fund.  
  AIM is entitled to receive an investment management fee equal to   1.5%   to   2.0%   of the beginning quarterly capital account balance of certain limited partners. AIM GP serves as the general partner to the AQUA U.S. Fund and the AQUA Master Fund. As such, it is entitled to receive a performance allocation, which is earned annually and equals   15%   to   20%   of positive changes in the capital account balance of certain of its limited partners. Ashford Prime, Ashford Trust and other limited partners are not obligated to pay any portion of the management fee or the performance allocation to AIM or AIM GP, as applicable, but do share pro rata in all other applicable expenses. 
  On March 8, 2016, our   $3.0 million   note receivable from OpenKey, a consolidated entity in which the noncontrolling interest holder held a   100%   interest, was converted into equity in OpenKey pursuant to a financing arrangement between the Company and OpenKey, upon a   $2.0 million   investment in the entity by Ashford Trust. See notes 2, 8,10 and 13.

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of our asset and investment management, business including the AQUA Fund and entities that we consolidate. Our asset and investment management business provides asset and investment management, accounting and legal services to Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime and the AQUA Fund. In this report, the terms the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  refers to Ashford Inc. and all entities included in its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  2. Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   The accompanying historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ashford Inc., its majority-owned subsidiaries and entities which it controls. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated in these historical condensed consolidated financial statements. The AQUA Funds are investment companies and follow the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Boards ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946. We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. We believe the disclosures made herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. However, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 15, 2016  . 
  A variable interest entity ( VIE ) must be consolidated by a reporting entity if the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary because it has (i) the power to direct the VIE s activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, (ii) an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed, and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. 
  The AQUA Fund is considered to be a VIE, as defined by authoritative accounting guidance. All major decisions related to the AQUA Fund that most significantly impact its economic performance, including but not limited to admittance of limited partners and purchasing, selling (including short sales), investing and trading in investments and engaging in financial transactions, including borrowing, financing, pledging, hedging and other derivative transactions are subject to the approval of our wholly-owned subsidiary, AIM GP. As such, we consolidate the AQUA Fund. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the AQUA Fund held approximately   $56.8 million   and   $107.9 million  , respectively, of total assets consisting primarily of investments in securities, cash and cash equivalents and receivables that can only be used to settle the obligations of the AQUA Fund Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the AQUA Fund had liabilities of   $2.5 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, consisting primarily of liabilities associated with investments in securities for which creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held a variable interest in OpenKey, a consolidated VIE in which the redeemable noncontrolling interest holder held a   49.13%   interest and the noncontrolling interest holders held a   12.50%   interest. As we meet the conditions discussed above, we are considered the primary beneficiary of OpenKey and therefore we consolidate it. As of   September 30, 2016  , OpenKey held approximately   $575,000   of total assets that primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents and other assets that can only be used to settle its obligations. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , OpenKey had accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $105,000   for which creditors do not have recourse to Ashford Inc. As of   December 31, 2015  , the variable interest was held in the form of a note receivable due from OpenKey with an outstanding balance of   $3.0 million   that eliminated in consolidation and the noncontrolling interest holder held a   100%   interest. As of   December 31, 2015  , OpenKey held approximately   $653,000   of total assets that primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents and other assets that could only be used to settle its obligations. Additionally, as of   December 31, 2015  , OpenKey had accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $177,000   for which creditors did not have recourse to Ashford Inc. 
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Noncontrolling Interests   The redeemable noncontrolling interests in Ashford LLC represent the members  proportionate share of equity in earnings/losses of Ashford LLC, which is an allocation of net income/loss attributable to the common unit holders based on the weighted average ownership percentage of these members  common unit holdings throughout the period. The redeemable noncontrolling interests in Ashford LLC is classified in the mezzanine section of the condensed consolidated balance sheets as these redeemable operating units do not meet the requirements for equity classification prescribed by the authoritative accounting guidance because these redeemable operating units may be redeemed by the holder. The carrying value of the noncontrolling interests in Ashford LLC is based on the greater of the accumulated historical cost or the redemption value. 
  The redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiary common stock as of   September 30, 2016   represented the   49.13%   ownership interest in a consolidated VIE, OpenKey, retained by the party that previously held a   100%   interest and was previously included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as of December 31, 2015. The redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary common stock is included in the  mezzanine  section of our condensed consolidated balance sheet as it is redeemable outside of the Company s control. The carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiary common stock is based on the accumulated historical cost adjusted to reflect the excess of redemption value over the accumulated historical cost. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represented noncontrolling ownership interests of   40%   in Performance Holdco,   100%   in the AQUA Fund and   12.50%   in OpenKey. At   December 31, 2015  , the noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represented noncontrolling ownership interests of   40%   in AIM,   100%   in the AQUA Fund and   100%   in OpenKey, an entity in which we held a variable interest in the form of a note receivable. 
  Revenue Recognition   Revenues primarily consist of advisory and investment management fees and expense reimbursements that are recognized when services have been rendered. Advisory fees consist of base management fees and incentive fees. The quarterly base fee ranges from   0.70%   to   0.50%   per annum of the total market capitalization ranges from less than   $6.0 billion   to greater than   $10.0 billion   of Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust, as defined in the amended advisory agreements, subject to certain minimums. Reimbursements for overhead, travel expenses, risk management and internal audit services are recognized when services have been rendered. We also record advisory revenue for equity grants of Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust common stock and Long-Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) units awarded to our officers and employees in connection with providing advisory services equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in  salaries and benefits.  The incentive fee is earned annually in each year that Ashford Prime s and/or Ashford Trust s annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company s respective peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the advisory agreements. Incentive fees are paid over a three-year period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition. Accordingly, incentive fee revenue is recognized only when the amount earned is fixed and determinable and the FCCR Condition has been met. As incentive fees are earned annually, we recognize revenue quarterly based on the amount that would be due pursuant to the applicable advisory agreement as of the interim balance sheet date in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. 
  Equity-Based Compensation   Equity-based compensation included in  salaries and benefits  is accounted for at fair value based on the market price of the shares/options on the date of grant in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. The fair value is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the shares/options. Grants of restricted stock to independent directors are recorded at fair value based on the market price of our shares at grant date, and this amount is fully expensed in  general and administrative  expense as the grants of stock are fully vested on the date of grant. Our officers and employees can be granted common stock and LTIP units from Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime in connection with providing advisory services that result in expense, included in  salaries and benefits,  equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well as offsetting revenue in an equal amount included in  advisory services  revenue.  
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   As there are no transactions requiring presentation in other comprehensive income (loss), but not in net income (loss), the Company s net income (loss) equates to other comprehensive income (loss). 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Entities   As of December 31, 2015, we held a first loss limited liability company interest (the "Interest") in an unconsolidated limited liability company (the "Fund"). The Fund was a private investment fund which generally invested its assets in one or more securities trading accounts that were managed by external investment advisers, including our subsidiary, Ashford Investment Management, LLC. Our initial investment in the Fund was made in May 2015 in the amount of   $5.0 million  , which represented an approximate   2%   ownership interest in the Fund. In accordance with the Fund's limited liability company agreement, a manager not affiliated with us possessed and exercised the full, complete and exclusive right, power and authority to manage and conduct the business and affairs of the Fund, subject only to certain withdrawal and voting rights we had and the requirements of applicable law. Due to our limited rights, we did not exercise significant influence over the Fund and therefore did not account for the Interest under the equity method of accounting. The Fund was in an investment company (as

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

defined by GAAP) for which the Interests do not have a readily determinable value. Instead, the manager of the Fund calculated a net asset value ( NAV ) for the Interests monthly in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Changes in the NAV were recorded in  unrealized gain/loss in investment in unconsolidated entity." We requested redemption of the Interest effective March 29, 2016. The redeemed amount of   $1.4 million   was received during the second quarter of 2016, which reduced our carrying value to   $0  .   No   gain or loss was recognized for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . We recognized an unrealized gain of   $2.1 million   and a realized loss of   $3.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the investment, which approximated fair value, was   $2.8 million  . 
  We also hold an investment in an unconsolidated entity with a carrying value of   $500,000   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which we account for under the cost method of accounting as we do not exercise significant influence over the entity. We review the investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment in each reporting period pursuant to the applicable authoritative accounting guidance. An investment is impaired when its estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of our investment. Any impairment is recorded in equity in earnings/loss in unconsolidated entities.   No   such impairment was recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our investments in certain unconsolidated entities are considered to be variable interests in the underlying entities. Because we do not have the power and financial responsibility to direct the unconsolidated entities  activities and operations, we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these entities on an ongoing basis and therefore such entities should not be consolidated. In evaluating VIEs, our analysis involves considerable management judgment and assumptions. 
  Income Taxes   The Company is subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The AQUA Fund does not record a provision for U.S. federal, state, or local income taxes as it is a partnership, and the AQUA Fund partners report their share of the AQUA Fund s income or loss on their income tax returns. However, certain U.S. dividend income and interest income may be subject to a maximum   30%   withholding tax for those limited partners that are foreign entities or foreign individuals. 
  Our effective tax rates on income (loss) before income taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   (111.2)%   and   (5.5)%  , and   (12.8)%   and   (9.6)%  , respectively. The rates reflect the effects of permanent differences, changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in partnerships and LLC s taxed as partnerships for which taxes are not the responsibility of the company. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the rates also reflect the effect of a   0%   effective tax rate on the net losses of a consolidated VIE due to it being more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized primarily because of the entity's history of losses. The portion of equity-based compensation expense related to LTIP units granted to Ashford Trust employees prior to the spin-off is not deductible for income tax purposes and is accounted for as a permanent difference. 
  We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. We assess whether valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a  more likely than not  standard. The analysis utilized in determining the valuation allowance involves considerable judgment and assumptions. At   September 30, 2016  , we recorded gross deferred tax assets of   $11.2 million   and a partial valuation allowance of   $6.2 million  , resulting in recognition of net deferred tax assets of   $5.0 million  . After consideration of all evidence, including the positive evidence of taxable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the period after the spin-off from November 12, 2014, through December 31, 2014, we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets due to the carryback potential of certain deferred tax assets. If our operating performance improves on a sustained basis, our conclusion regarding the need for a valuation allowance could change, resulting in the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance in the future. The analysis utilized in determining the valuation allowance involves considerable judgment and assumptions. 
  The  Income Taxes  Topic of the FASB ASC addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. The guidance requires us to determine whether tax positions we have taken or expect to take in a tax return are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority based on the technical merits of the positions. Tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold would be recorded as additional tax expense in the current period. We analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations for each jurisdiction, which includes the federal jurisdiction and various states. We classify interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense. We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and cities. Tax years 2013 through 2015 remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards   In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). The ASU amends the consolidation guidance for VIEs and general partners  investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805) Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   ( ASU 2015-16 ), as part of its simplification initiative to provide guidance on management s responsibility to adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and to provide related disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 applies to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU   2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model, which requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The update will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date to fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB has also issued additional updates that further clarify the requirements of Topic 606 and provide implementation guidance. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method.  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ), to provide guidance on management s responsibility to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure requirements. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in OCI the changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes based on an exit price and; (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of AFS debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 provides an election to subsequently measure certain nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. It also requires a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Certain provisions of ASU 2016-01 are eligible for early adoption. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as a financing. If the lessor doesn t convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases as well as for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ). The new standard requires an investor to apply the equity method of accounting only from the date it qualifies for that method, i.e., the date the investor obtains significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an investee. The ASU eliminates the previous requirement to retroactively adjust the investment and record a cumulative catch up for the periods that the investment had been held, but did not qualify for the equity method of accounting. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ) as part of the FASB simplification initiative. The new standard requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. In addition, the ASU increases the tax withholding requirements threshold to qualify for equity classification. The ASU also clarifies that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. The ASU provides an optional accounting policy election to be applied on an entity-wide basis to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). The ASU sets forth an  expected credit loss  impairment model to replace the current  incurred loss  method of recognizing credit losses. The standard requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for most financial assets held.     The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force   ( ASU 2016-15 ). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include - Debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
  3. Derivative Contracts 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the volume of the AQUA Fund s option derivative activities based on their notional amounts, which are the fair values of the underlying shares as if the options were exercised at   September 30, 2016  , was   17,000   long exposure contracts with a notional amount of   $0   and   no   short exposure contracts. As of   December 31, 2015  , the volume of the AQUA Fund s option derivative activities based on their notional amounts, which are the fair values of the underlying shares as if the options

were exercised at December 31,   2015  , was   41,000   long exposure contracts with a notional amount of   $6.0 million   and   27,000   short exposure contracts with a notional amount of   $114,000  . 
  Options on Futures Contracts   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we purchased options on Eurodollar futures for total costs of   $94,000  , and a maturity date of June 2017. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we purchased options on Eurodollar futures for total costs of   $326,000  , and maturity dates ranging from   September 2016 to March 2017  . These options were not designated as cash flow hedges. The carrying value of these options on futures contract is included in  investments in securities  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  4. Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair Value Hierarchy   Our financial instruments measured at fair value either on a recurring or a non-recurring basis are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs in the market place as discussed below: 
     Level 1: Fair value measurements that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that we have the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. Market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. 
     Level 2: Fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 
     Level 3: Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following tables present our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis aggregated by the level within which measurements fall in the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

5. Summary of Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Certain of our financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts at which these instruments could be purchased, sold or settled. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows (in thousands): 

Investments in securities and liabilities associated with investments in securities  . Investment securities consist of U.S. treasury securities, publicly traded equity securities, equity put and call options on certain publicly traded equity securities and futures contracts. Liabilities associated with investments in securities consist of a margin account balance and short equity put and call options. The fair value of these investments is based on quoted market closing prices at the balance sheet dates in active and inactive markets. This is considered either a Level 1 or Level 2 valuation technique. See notes 2, 3 and 4 for a complete description of the methodology and assumptions utilized in determining fair values. 
  Deferred compensation plan.   The liability resulting from the deferred compensation plan is carried at fair value based on the closing prices of the underlying investments. This is considered a Level 1 valuation technique. 
  Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.   These financial assets bear interest at market rates and have maturities of less than   90   days. The carrying values approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. This is considered a Level 1 valuation technique.    
  Receivables, due from Ashford Trust OP, net, due from Ashford Prime OP, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses, due to affiliates and other liabilities  . The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due primarily to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. This is considered a Level 1 valuation technique. 
   
  6. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Litigation   On December 11, 2015, a purported stockholder class action and derivative complaint challenging the Remington acquisition, described in note 7, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and styled Campbell v. Bennett et al., Case No. 11796. The complaint names as defendants each of the members of the Company's board of directors, Archie Bennett, Jr., Mark A. Sharkey, MJB Investments GP, LLC and Remington Holdings GP, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that the members of the Company s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company s stockholders in connection with the Transactions and that Monty Bennett, Archie Bennett, Jr., Mark A. Sharkey, MJB Investments GP, LLC and Remington Holdings GP aided and abetted the purported breaches of fiduciary duty. In support of these claims, the complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company s board of directors engaged in an unfair process with Remington Lodging and the Bennetts and as a result the Company overpaid for the 80% limited partnership and 100% general partnership interests in Remington Lodging. The complaint also alleges that the proxy statement filed with the SEC contains certain materially false and/ 
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  
  ASHFORD INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

or misleading statements. The action seeks injunctive relief, including enjoining the special meeting of stockholders and any vote on the contribution or the stock issuances or rescinding the Transactions if they are consummated, or in the alternative an award of damages, as well as unspecified attorneys' and other fees and costs, in addition to any other relief the court may deem proper. Since the filing of the complaint, the special meeting of stockholders and related vote occurred with the stockholders approving the acquisition. 
  The outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with any certainty. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the consummation of the Transactions, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely prohibit consummation of the Transactions. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint but intend to defend the claims raised in this lawsuit. 
  On March 14, 2016, Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ( Sessa ) filed third party claims against the Company and Ashford LLC in connection with a suit filed by Ashford Prime against Sessa, related parties, and Sessa s proposed Ashford Prime director nominees John E. Petry, Philip B. Livingston, Lawrence A. Cunningham, Daniel B. Silvers and Chris D. Wheeler. The case is captioned Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. v. Sessa Capital (Master), L.P., et al., No. 16-cv-00527 and is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Sessa generally alleges that the Company and Ashford LLC aided and abetted the Ashford Prime directors  breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the June 2015 amendments to Ashford Prime s advisory agreement with Ashford LLC. Among other relief, Sessa seeks an injunction preventing the Company from attempting to solicit proxies on behalf of Ashford Prime until Ashford Prime s directors approve Sessa s proposed director nominees under the terms of the advisory agreement. On May 20, 2016, the court denied Sessa s request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Sessa from, among other things, soliciting proxies or otherwise seeking election of its proposed candidates to the Ashford Prime board. Sessa appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on May 23, 2016. Sessa s appeal is fully briefed and the court heard oral argument on August 2, 2016. Sessa currently has no claims for monetary damages, but it seeks reimbursement of its attorneys  fees and costs. The outcome of the litigation is pending but the Company intends to vigorously defend the claims filed by Sessa. 
  In the federal court litigation with Sessa, Ashford Prime has requested through discovery the names and identities of Sessa s limited partners, communication between those limited partners and Sessa, and information about cooperation between Sessa and its limited partners in support of its claims that Sessa violated Ashford Prime s bylaws and federal securities laws. Sessa has refused to provide the information and Ashford Prime has asked the district court to order Sessa to comply with the discovery requests. The Company understands that additional discovery will be pursued against the limited partners themselves as their identities are revealed regarding all communication between the limited partners and Sessa related to the Company, Ashford Prime and its affiliates. 
  On March 22, 2016, the Company and Ashford LLC filed a lawsuit in Texas state district court in Dallas against Sessa, related entities, and John E. Petry, Philip B. Livingston, Lawrence A. Cunningham, Daniel B. Silvers and Chris D. Wheeler. The case is captioned Ashford Inc., et al v. Sessa Capital (Master), L.P., et al., Cause No. 16-DC-03340. The Company generally alleges that the defendants have engaged in wrongful acts, including engaging in an unlawful proxy contest for control of the Ashford Prime board, and are tortiously interfering with the Company and Ashford LLC s advisory agreement with Ashford Prime. Among other relief, the Company seeks actual and exemplary damages, as well as an injunction prohibiting defendants from further interference with the advisory agreement or the Company s managerial and operational control of Ashford Prime and its assets. The outcome of the litigation is pending. 
  The Company is engaged in other various legal proceedings which have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of loss for these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible and to probable. Based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and if the Company failed to prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the Company s current estimates of the range of potential losses, the Company s financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods. 
  Securities Sold Short   The AQUA Fund is subject to certain inherent risks arising from selling securities short. The ultimate cost to the AQUA Fund to acquire these securities may exceed the liability reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

7. Related Party Transactions 
  We are a party to an amended and restated advisory agreement with Ashford Trust OP. The quarterly base fee is based on a declining sliding scale percentage of Ashford Trust s total market capitalization plus the Key Money Asset Management Fee (defined in our advisory agreement as the aggregate gross asset value of all key money assets multiplied by   0.7%  ), subject to a minimum quarterly base fee, as payment for managing its day-to-day operations in accordance with its investment guidelines. Total market capitalization includes the aggregate principal amount of its consolidated indebtedness (including its proportionate share of debt of any entity that is not consolidated but excluding its joint venture partners  proportionate share of consolidated debt). The range of base fees on the scale are between   0.70%   and   0.50%   per annum for total market capitalization that ranges from less than   $6.0 billion   to greater than   $10.0 billion  . At   September 30, 2016  , the quarterly base fee was   0.70%   per annum. Reimbursement for overhead and internal audit, insurance claims advisory and asset management services, including compensation, benefits and travel expense reimbursements, are billed quarterly to Ashford Trust based on a pro rata allocation as determined by the ratio of Ashford Trust s net investment in hotel properties in relation to the total net investment in hotel properties for both Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime. We also record advisory revenue for equity grants of Ashford Trust common stock and LTIP units awarded to our officers and employees in connection with providing advisory services equal to the fair value of the award in proportion to the requisite service period satisfied during the period, as well as an offsetting expense in an equal amount included in  salaries and benefits.  We are also entitled to an incentive fee that is earned annually in each year that Ashford Trust s annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for Ashford Trust s peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the advisory agreement.

               (4)    
    In connection with our key money transaction with Ashford Prime, we lease furniture, fixtures and equipment to Ashford Prime at no cost. A portion of the base advisory fee is allocated to lease revenue each period equal to the estimated fair value of the lease payments that would have been made. 
     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had receivables of   $1.6 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively, from Ashford Prime OP associated with the advisory service fee discussed above. As of September 30, 2016, receivables from Ashford Prime OP also included an offsetting   $2.3 million   payable related to the hold back from Ashford Prime s liquidation of the AQUA Fund. 
  Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime have management agreements with Remington Holdings L.P. and its subsidiaries ( Remington Lodging ), which is beneficially owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ashford Trust s Chairman Emeritus. Transactions related to these agreements are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Certain employees of Remington Lodging who perform work on behalf of Ashford Trust were granted shares of restricted stock under the Ashford Trust Stock Plan prior to our spin-off. These share grants were accounted for under the applicable accounting guidance related to share-based payments granted to non-employees and are recorded in  general and administrative  expense. Expense was recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the amount of   $2,000   and   $7,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $2,000   and   $7,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  On June 11, 2015, we announced that we are providing a total of   $6.0 million   in key money consideration to our managed REITs for   two   acquisitions.   In connection with our engagement to provide hotel advisory services to Ashford Trust, w  e are providing up to   $4.0 million   of key money   consideration to purchase furniture, fixtures and equipment related to Ashford Trust s   $62.5 million   acquisition of the   226  -room Le Pavillon Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana, which closed in June 2015. The   $4.0 million   obligation is included in non-current  other assets  and  Due from Ashford Trust, net  on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  .   Separately, in connection with our engagement to provide hotel advisory services to Ashford Prime, w  e have also provided   $2.0 million   of key money consideration comprised of   $206,000   in cash and the issuance of   19,897   shares of our common stock   to purchase furniture, fixtures and equipment related to   Ashford Prime s   $85.0 million   acquisition of the   62  -room Bardessono Hotel and Spa in Yountville, California, which closed in July 2015. The initial value assigned to the common stock was based on the previous   10  -day closing prices as of July 1, 2015, which was approximately   $1.8 million  . The key money consideration was paid on September 14, 2015. In return for the key money consideration, Ashford Prime transferred furniture, fixtures and equipment to Ashford Inc., which was subsequently leased back at no cost for a term of five years. The fair value of the key money consideration transferred on September 14, 2015, was approximately   $1.6 million  , which decreased in value from July 1, 2015 solely due to the change in the price of Ashford Inc. common stock.  
  The hotel advisory services and the lease are considered a multiple element arrangement, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. As such, a portion of the base advisory fee should be allocated to lease revenue equal to the estimated fair value of the lease payments that would have been made. As a result, advisory revenue of   $84,000   and   $252,000   was allocated to lease revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Advisory revenue of   $15,000   was allocated to lease revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Lease revenue is included in  other  revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
  On September 17, 2015, we entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the  Remington Acquisition Agreement ) to acquire   80%   of Remington Lodging for total consideration of   $331.7 million  , with an estimated fair value of   $330.7 million  . Under the agreement, Ashford Inc. s existing business along with   80%   of Remington Lodging will be contributed to a new subsidiary of Ashford Inc., Ashford Advisors, Inc. ( Ashford Advisors ).The total consideration will be in the form of   916,500   shares of Ashford Advisors, Inc. Class B non-voting common stock, representing a   29.4%   initial ownership in Ashford Advisors, Inc., with an estimated fair value of approximately   $91.7 million  ; (ii)   9,200,000   shares of Ashford Advisors, Inc.   6.625%   non-voting convertible preferred stock with an estimated fair value of approximately   $230.0 million  ; and (iii)   $10.0 million   zero coupon note payable issued by Remington Hospitality Management, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashford Advisors, with an estimated fair value of approximately   $9.0 million  . 
  The Ashford Advisors preferred and common stock and the   20%   interest retained by the principals of Remington Lodging will be subject to certain put, call and/or conversion rights which could result in the previous owners of Remington Lodging receiving subsidiary voting shares and/or preferred or common shares of Ashford Inc. On April 12, 2016, Ashford Inc. s stockholders approved the acquisition. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain tax related conditions. 
  The incremental EBITDA that Ashford receives from Remington Lodging for managing properties for Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime will not be included in the calculation of any termination fees due under the advisory agreements. The Board of Ashford has entered into side letter agreements with the boards of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime that address the exclusion of this income from the termination fee calculation.

  Overview 
  We were formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2014 and became a public company on November 12, 2014, when Ashford Trust, a NYSE-listed REIT, completed the spin-off of our company through the distribution of our outstanding common stock to the Ashford Trust stockholders. Effective as of October 31, 2016, Ashford Inc. changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland. As of   November 7, 2016  , Ashford Trust beneficially owned approximately   598,000   shares of our common stock, representing approximately   30%   of our company. 
  Our principal business objective is to provide asset management and other advisory services to other entities. Currently, we, through our operating subsidiary Ashford LLC, act as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime. In our capacity as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime, in each case subject to the supervision and oversight of the respective board of directors of such entity. We provide the personnel and services necessary to allow each of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime to conduct its respective business. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. We are not responsible, but may in the future be responsible, for managing the day-to-day operations of the individual hotel properties owned by either Ashford Trust or Ashford Prime, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the property management companies that operate the hotel properties owned by Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime. 
  Recent Developments 
  On March 8, 2016, our   $3.0 million   note receivable from OpenKey, a consolidated entity in which the noncontrolling interest holder held a   100%   interest, was converted into equity in OpenKey pursuant to a financing arrangement between the Company and OpenKey, upon the investment of   $2.0 million   in the entity by Ashford Trust. For further discussion see notes 1, 2, 8 and 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  On September 17, 2015, we entered into the Remington Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which Ashford Inc. will acquire all of the general partner interest and 80% of the limited partner interests in Remington Lodging. On April 12, 2016, our stockholders approved the acquisition. On September 22, 2016, we amended the first amendment, dated May 24, 2016, and extended the date with respect to which Ashford Inc. and Remington Lodging have the right to terminate the agreement if the acquisition is not consummated by to April 7, 2017. For further discussion see note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Effective as of October 31, 2016, Ashford Inc. changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland. The reincorporation was effected by merging Ashford Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Ashford Delaware ), with and into a wholly owned Maryland subsidiary established for this purpose (the  Reincorporation Merger ) pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 28, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ), following approval by the requisite vote of the Company s  
  
   26 

stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on October 27, 2016. As a result of the Reincorporation Merger, Ashford Inc., a Maryland corporation ( Ashford Maryland ), is the successor issuer of Ashford Delaware under Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
  Other than the change of corporate domicile, the reincorporation did not result in any change in the name, business, physical locations, management, assets, liabilities, net worth or number of authorized shares of the Company, nor will it result in any change in location of our current employees, including management. In addition, the Company s common stock will continue to be listed under the symbol  AINC  on the NYSE MKT. Each outstanding certificate representing shares of Ashford Delaware s common stock automatically represents, without any action of Ashford Delaware s stockholders, the same number of shares of Ashford Maryland s common stock. Ashford Delaware s shareholders did not need to exchange their stock certificates as a result of the Reincorporation Merger. As of October 31, 2016, the rights of the Company s stockholders commenced to be governed by the Maryland General Corporation Law, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Ashford Inc. and the Bylaws of Ashford Inc. 
  On November 2, 2016, Ashford Inc., Ashford LLC, the operating company of Ashford Inc., and Richard J. Stockton entered into an employment agreement pursuant to which, effective November 14, 2016, Mr. Stockton will be employed by Ashford LLC to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Ashford Prime, pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated June 10, 2015, as amended from time to time, between Ashford Inc., Ashford LLC, Ashford Prime and their respective affiliates, which provides that Ashford LLC is responsible for managing Ashford Prime s affairs.

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we may form or invest in partnerships or joint ventures. We evaluate each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE ). If the entity is determined to be a VIE, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary and need to consolidate the entity. For further discussion see notes 1 and 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  There have been no material changes since   December 31, 2015  , outside the ordinary course of business, to contractual obligations specified in the table of contractual obligations included in the section  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our accounting policies that are critical or most important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in the section  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our   2015   Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies. 
   
           ITEM     3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     We hold options on Eurodollar futures as a hedge against our cash flows. Eurodollar futures prices reflect market expectations for interest rates on three month Eurodollar deposits for specific dates in the future, and the final settlement price is determined by three-month LIBOR on the last trading day. Options on Eurodollar futures provide the ability to limit losses while maintaining the possibility of profiting from favorable changes in the futures prices. As the purchaser, our maximum potential loss is limited to the initial premium paid for the Eurodollar option contracts, while our potential gain has no limit. These exchange-traded options are centrally cleared, and a clearinghouse stands in between all trades to ensure that the obligations involved in the trades are satisfied. 
  We together with our wholly-owned subsidiaries do not hold any other financial instruments that subject us to market risk.

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     On December 11, 2015, a purported stockholder class action and derivative complaint challenging the Remington acquisition, described in note 11, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and styled Campbell v. Bennett et al., Case No. 11796. The complaint names as defendants each of the members of the Company's board of directors, Archie Bennett, Jr., Mark A. Sharkey, MJB Investments GP, LLC and Remington Holdings GP, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that the members of the Company s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company s stockholders in connection with the Transactions and that Monty Bennett, Archie Bennett, Jr., Mark A. Sharkey, MJB Investments GP, LLC and Remington Holdings GP aided and abetted the purported breaches of fiduciary duty. In support of these claims, the complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company s board of directors engaged in an unfair process with Remington Lodging and the Bennetts and as a result the Company overpaid for the 80% limited partnership and 100% general partnership interests in Remington Lodging. The complaint also alleges that the proxy statement filed with the SEC contains certain materially false and/or misleading statements. The action seeks injunctive relief, including enjoining the special meeting of stockholders and any vote on the contribution or the stock issuances or rescinding the Transactions if they are consummated, or in the alternative an award of damages, as well as unspecified attorneys' and other fees and costs, in addition to any other relief the court may deem proper. Since the filing of the complaint, the special meeting of stockholders and related vote occurred with the stockholders approving the acquisition. 
  The outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with any certainty. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the consummation of the Transactions, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely prohibit consummation of the Transactions. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint but intend to defend the claims raised in this lawsuit. 
  On March 14, 2016, Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ( Sessa ) filed third party claims against the Company and Ashford LLC in connection with a suit filed by Ashford Prime against Sessa, related parties, and Sessa s proposed Ashford Prime director nominees John E. Petry, Philip B. Livingston, Lawrence A. Cunningham, Daniel B. Silvers and Chris D. Wheeler. The case is captioned Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. v. Sessa Capital (Master), L.P., et al., No. 16-cv-00527 and is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Sessa generally alleges that the Company and Ashford LLC aided and abetted the Ashford Prime directors  breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the June 2015 amendments to the Ashford Prime s advisory agreement with Ashford LLC. Among other relief, Sessa seeks an injunction preventing the Company from attempting to solicit proxies on behalf of Ashford Prime until Ashford Prime s directors approve Sessa s proposed director nominees under the terms of the advisory agreement. On May 20, 2016, the court denied Sessa s request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Sessa from, among other things, soliciting proxies or otherwise seeking election of its proposed candidates to the Ashford Prime board. Sessa appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on May 23, 2016. Sessa s appeal is fully briefed and the court heard oral argument on August 2, 2016. Sessa currently has no claims for monetary damages, but it seeks reimbursement of its attorneys  fees and costs. The outcome of the litigation is pending but the Company intends to vigorously defend the claims filed by Sessa. 
  In the federal court litigation with Sessa, Ashford Prime has requested through discovery the names and identities of Sessa s limited partners, communication between those limited partners and Sessa, and information about cooperation between Sessa and its limited partners in support of its claims that Sessa violated Ashford Prime s bylaws and federal securities laws. Sessa has refused to provide the information and Ashford Prime has asked the district court to order Sessa to comply with the discovery requests. The Company understands that additional discovery will be pursued against the limited partners themselves as their identities are revealed regarding all communication between the limited partners and Sessa related to the Company, Ashford Prime and its affiliates. 
  
   35 

On March 22, 2016, the Company and Ashford LLC filed a lawsuit in Texas state district court in Dallas against Sessa, related entities, and John E. Petry, Philip B. Livingston, Lawrence A. Cunningham, Daniel B. Silvers and Chris D. Wheeler. The case is captioned Ashford Inc., et al v. Sessa Capital (Master), L.P., et al., Cause No. 16-DC-03340. The Company generally alleges that the defendants have engaged in wrongful acts, including engaging in an unlawful proxy contest for control of the Ashford Prime board, and are tortiously interfering with the Company and Ashford LLC s advisory agreement with Ashford Prime. Among other relief, the Company seeks actual and exemplary damages, as well as an injunction prohibiting defendants from further interference with the advisory agreement or the Company s managerial and operational control of Ashford Prime and its assets. The outcome of the litigation is pending. 
  The Company is engaged in other various legal proceedings which have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of loss for these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible and to probable. Based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and if the Company failed to prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the Company s current estimates of the range of potential losses, the Company s financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods. 
   
           ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our   2015   Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on   March 15, 2016  , which describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject.
