Note 1   Organization and Basis of Presentation  

Rennova Health, Inc. ( Rennova ),
together with its subsidiaries (the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ), is a vertically
integrated provider of healthcare related products and services. The Company s principal lines of business are (i) clinical
laboratory operations, (ii) supportive software solutions, which includes Electronic Health Records ( EHR ), Medical
Billing Services and Laboratory Information Services ( LIS ) and (iii) decision support and informatics operations. 

Merger between the Company and
Medytox Solutions, Inc.   

 On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among the Company, CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. ( Merger
Sub ), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox Solutions, Inc.
( Medytox ), Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (the  Merger ). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to
effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and to change its name from CollabRx, Inc. to Rennova Health, Inc. In connection with the
Merger, (i) each share of common stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive approximately 0.4096 shares of common
stock of the Company, (ii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive one share
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, and (iii) each share of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of Medytox
was converted into the right to receive one share of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company. 

Holders of Company equity prior to the closing
of the Merger (including all outstanding Company common stock and all restricted stock units, options and warrants exercisable
for shares of Company common stock) held approximately 10% of the Company's common stock immediately following the closing of the
Merger, and holders of Medytox equity prior to the closing of the Merger (including all outstanding Medytox common stock and all
outstanding options exercisable for shares of Medytox common stock, but less certain options that were cancelled upon the closing
pursuant to agreements between Medytox and such optionees) held approximately 90% of the Company's common stock immediately following
the closing of the Merger, in each case on a fully diluted basis, provided, however, outstanding shares of the newly designated
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, certain outstanding convertible promissory notes
exercisable for Company common stock after the closing and certain option grants expected to be made following the closing of the
Merger are excluded from such ownership percentages. The Merger resulted in a change in control of the Company, and as a result
this transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and, as such, the financial statements presented prior to November
2, 2015 are those of Medytox and the financial statements presented after November 2, 2015 reflect the operations of the combined
company. All common share amounts prior to November 2, 2015 have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock
split and the conversion ratio of Medytox common stock to common stock of the Company as a result of the Merger. 

On November 3, 2015, the common stock of Rennova
Health, Inc. commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol  RNVA.  Prior to that date, the Company s
common stock was listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol  CLRX.  Immediately after the consummation of
the Merger, the Company had 13,750,010 shares of common stock, 5,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 45,000
shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. 

Basis of Presentation   

 The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 audited annual financial statements
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ) on May 17, 2016. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the  instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC, and therefore omit or condense
certain footnotes and other information normally included in consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of
the Company s management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and
results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported herein. The results of operations presented are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. 

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, comprehensive loss was equal to the net loss amounts presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations. In addition, certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Going Concern   

 The
Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern that
contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
recently accumulated significant losses and has negative cash flows from operations, and at September 30, 2016 had a working
capital deficit and stockholders  deficit of $13.8 million and $10.0 million, respectively, which raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s cash position is critically
deficient, critical payments are not being made in the ordinary course and the Company has not made the required payments
under a secured debenture with an outstanding principal amount of $3.0 million, for which the Company currently does not have
the financial resources to satisfy (see notes 4 and 13). Management's plans with respect to alleviating the adverse
financial conditions which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include
increasing the volume of samples processed by its laboratories and the number of customers for its supportive software
solutions, as well as raising additional funds in the capital markets. In addition, the Company has undertaken additional
cost saving measures, including personnel reductions and a reorganization of the Company s sales force under the
direction of the new Chief Executive Officer of the Company s Medytox Medical Marketing   Sales, Inc. subsidiary.
No conclusion can be drawn at this time about the ultimate efficacy of these plans of action. 

On March 31, 2016,
the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from pledging certain of its accounts receivable as collateral to a prepaid forward
purchase contract (see note 4). On July 19, 2016, the Company closed a public offering of its equity securities and received net
proceeds of approximately $7.5 million (see note 7). In addition, in September of 2016 the Company received an income tax refund
in the amount of $1.8 million and received net proceeds from the sale of convertible notes in the amount of $0.4 million. 

There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to achieve its business plans, raise any additional capital or secure additional financing, if necessary,
to achieve its current operating plan.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability
to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraphs and eventually regain profitability. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as
a going concern. 

Note 2   Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 consisted of the following: 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company identified additional accounts receivable related to its Clinical Laboratory Operations business
segment that were deemed uncollectible. The primary factors in rendering these receivables uncollectible were the Company s
failure to obtain preauthorization from the third party payer prior to rendering services and the lack of an existing preferred
provider contract with the third party payer. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $3.5 million related to the Company s
inability to collect on these receivables, which is reflected in bad debt expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

Note 3   Property
and Equipment  

Property and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
consisted of the following: 

Depreciation expense on property and equipment
was $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $2.1 million and $2.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management periodically reviews the valuation of long-lived assets, including
property and equipment, for potential impairment. Management did not recognize any impairment of these assets during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note 4   Notes Payable  

The Company and its subsidiaries are party
to a number of loans with affiliates and unrelated parties. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notes payable consisted
of the following:

On September 15, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement with two investors whereby the Company sold to the investors convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount
of $0.4 million (the  September 2016 Notes ). The September 2016 Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s
common stock at a conversion price of $0.25 per share. In conjunction with the sale of the September 2016 Notes, the Company issued
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2 million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share.
Based on the allocation of the net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes to the fair value of the warrants, and the resulting
beneficial conversion features, the Company recognized a discount for the entire face value of the September 2016 Notes, which
is being accreted through the notes  maturity date of March 15, 2017. The Company has determined that the warrants issued
in this transaction do not qualify for equity treatment in the Company s consolidated balance sheet. As a result, the Company
recognized a derivative liability associated with these warrants in the amount of $0.3 million as of September 30, 2016. 

On March 31, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement to pledge certain of its accounts receivable as collateral against a prepaid forward purchase contract whereby the
Company received consideration in the amount of $5.0 million. The receivables had an estimated collectable value of $8.7 million
which had been adjusted down to approximately $4.3 million on the Company s balance sheet as of March 31, 2016. As of September
30, 2016, the carrying value of these receivables was $0.2 million. In exchange for the consideration received, the counterparty
received the right to: (i) a 20% per annum investment return from the Company on the consideration, with a minimum repayment term
of six months and minimum return of $0.5 million, (ii) all payments recovered from the accounts receivable up to $5.25 million,
if paid in full within six months, or $5.5 million, if not paid in full within six months, and (iii) 20% of all payments of the
accounts receivable in excess of amounts received in (i) and (ii). On March 31, 2017, to the extent that the counterparty
has not been paid $6.0 million, the Company is required to pay the difference. Christopher Diamantis, a director of the Company,
guaranteed the Company's payment obligation of up to $6.0 million. For providing the guarantee, and to the extent that the counterparty
receives amounts payable under clause (ii) above exceeding $5.0 million, Mr. Diamantis will be paid a fee by the counterparty
equal to the amount by which the amount received under clause (ii) above exceeds $5.0 million ($250,000 or $500,000, depending
on the timing of payment). In addition, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Diamantis $0.5 million in connection with his providing the
guarantee. This amount was settled in August of 2016 with the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock and warrants
to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (see note 5). 

The Company did not make the
monthly principal and interest payments due under the TCA Debenture for October, 2016 and November, 2016, and currently does
not have the financial resources to satisfy this obligation. The Company is currently negotiating a forbearance agreement
with the lender.  

The Company had been negotiating with the holders
of the Tegal Notes to exchange their notes for equity securities of the Company. In connection with such negotiations, the Company
did not make the principal payments that were due on July 12, 2016. As a result, the entire amounts outstanding as of September
30, 2016 are reflected in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company and the holders
of the Tegal Notes have not reached an agreement on an exchange and on October 14, 2016 the Company received a letter from the
holders demanding payment of the amounts that were due on July 12, 2016, and that the holders reserved the right to declare an
event of default under the terms of the notes in the event the amounts due were not paid. To date, the Company has not received
further communication from the holders of the Tegal Notes and the entire amount due remains outstanding.

On December 31, 2014, the Company borrowed
$3.0 million from D D Funding II, LLC ( D D ) and issued the D D Debenture. Christopher Diamantis, a director
of the Company, is the manager and 50% owner of D D. In January 2016, the Company temporarily repaid the $3.0 million due under
the D D Debenture. In addition to the principal amount, the Company paid $0.3 million in cash for interest for 2015. In March
2016, the Company re-borrowed 100% of the principal amount repaid in January 2016, repaid $2.25 million in April 2016 using the
proceeds from the accounts receivable pledge agreement described above, and repaid the remaining $750,000 in July 2016. The D D
Debenture was convertible into the Company s Common Stock at a 25% discount to the trailing ten-day average closing price
at any time prior to the repayment. In the event of conversion, the holder of the D D Debenture was also entitled to receive
a number of warrants to purchase the Company s Common Stock equal to the number of shares issued upon conversion with exercise
prices equal to the trailing ten-day average closing price of our Common Stock. These two features are derivative instruments that
are re-valued quarterly and are reflected in the table above. As a result of the repayment of the D D Debenture in 2016, the
associated derivative liability has been reclassified into stockholders  equity. 

On February 3, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.0
million from Alcimede LLC ( Alcimede ). Seamus Lagan, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, is
the sole manager of Alcimede. The note has an interest rate of 6% and was originally due on February 2, 2016. On June 29, 2015,
Alcimede exercised options granted in October 2012 to purchase one million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise
price of $2.50 per share, and the loan outstanding was reduced in satisfaction of the aggregate exercise price of $2.5 million.
In February 2016, Alcimede agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan to February 2, 2017. In August of 2016, $0.3 million
was repaid by the Company through the issuance of shares of common stock (see note 5), and the remaining balance due on this loan
as of September 30, 2016 was $0.2 million. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company
borrowed $1.6 million from Mr. Diamantis, which was due January 7, 2016. In January 2016, the Company repaid the $1.6 million due
Mr. Diamantis, along with $0.1 million in cash for interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received
additional short-term advances from Mr. Diamantis aggregating to $4.2 million, $3.7 million of which was repaid during the period.
In connection with these advances, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Diamantis interest in the amount of $0.4 million, which is reflected
in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. Also during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company received short-term advances from two principal stockholders aggregating to approximately $1.0
million, of which approximately $0.4 million was repaid during the period. These advances are payable on demand. 

Note 5   Related Party Transactions  

In addition to the transactions discussed in
note 4 and note 7, the Company had the following related party transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

Alcimede billed the Company $0.3 million for
consulting fees pursuant to a consulting agreement for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

During the second quarter of 2016, the
Company received a short-term advance from Jason Adams, the Company s then Chief Financial Officer, in the amount of $50,000,
all of which was repaid during the second quarter. 

On August 1, 2015, Medytox entered into
a non-exclusive consulting agreement with Monarch Capital, LLC ( Monarch ). Michael Goldberg, at the time a director
of Medytox and currently a director of the Company, is the Managing Director of Monarch. Under this agreement, Monarch provides
business and financial advice. The original term of the agreement was through August 31, 2016, and is subject to automatic renewal
for an additional one year unless Medytox provides the consultant with 180 days  prior written notice of its intent not
to renew. The agreement has been renewed for an additional year. Monarch billed the Company $0.2 million and $15,000 for consulting
fees pursuant to this agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In August 2016, the Company
exchanged an aggregate of $2.1 million of indebtedness and other obligations to various related parties for an aggregate of 5,544,441
shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 3,123,313 shares of the Company s common stock. The warrants issued have
an exercise price of $0.45 per share, are immediately exercisable and have a five-year term. The issuance of the shares of common
stock and warrants was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in accordance with
Section 4(a)(2) thereof, as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. 

On June 30, 2015, the Company issued

Preferred Stock   

 During the nine months ended September 30,
2015, the former Medytox Series B preferred shareholders earned dividends totaling $1.6 million. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, accrued dividends of $0.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, were included in accrued expenses. In conjunction with
the Merger, all outstanding Medytox Series B preferred shares were cancelled in exchange for shares of Rennova Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock (the  Series B Preferred Stock ), which were not entitled to receive dividends unless dividends are
declared on the Company s common stock. On September 6, 2016, all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were
converted into an aggregate of 5,733,945 shares of the Company s common stock, in accordance with the terms of the Series
B Preferred Stock. 

On August 26, 2016, in accordance with the
terms of a stock purchase agreement between the Company and Epinex Diagnostics, Inc. ( Epinex Diagnostics ), the Company
cancelled the 45,000 shares of its Series E Preferred Stock that had previously been issued to Epinex Diagnostics. 

Between January 1, 2016 and July 10, 2016,
holders of the Company s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series C Preferred Stock ) converted a total
of 260 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 167,743 shares of common stock. On July 11, 2016, the Company entered into Exchange
Agreements with the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of the Company s 6,451,613 warrants to purchase
shares of common stock issued December 30, 2015 (the  December 2015 Warrants ), to exchange such securities for shares
of newly-authorized Series G Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share (the  Series G Preferred
Stock ) and new warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the  Exchange ). The Exchange closed on July 19,
2016 in conjunction with the public offering discussed below, and the outstanding 8,740 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and
the December 2015 Warrants were exchanged for 13,793 shares of Series G Preferred Stock and new warrants to purchase 10,249,517
shares of the Company s common stock (the  Exchange Warrants ). On July 6, 2016, stockholders representing approximately
74% of the voting power of the Company approved the Exchange. The Exchange was made in reliance upon the exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof based on the representations of the
holders. No commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting the Exchange. 

The Series G Preferred
Stock is convertible into common stock at the stated value divided by $0.45. The exercise price of the Exchange Warrants is $0.45
per share. No gain or loss was recognized by the Company as result of the Exchange, however the Company did record a gain on the
change in fair value of the December 2015 Warrants of $1.7 million in July 2016. Subsequent to the closing of the Exchange through
September 30, 2016, 4,182 shares of Series G Preferred Stock were converted into 9,292,905 shares of the Company s common
stock. 

Common Stock

Stock Options    

 The Company currently
maintains and sponsors the Tegal Corporation 2007 Incentive Award Plan (the  2007 Equity Plan ). Tegal Corporation
is the predecessor entity to CollabRx. The 2007 Equity Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of stock options and other equity
awards to the Company s officers, directors, employees and consultants. On May 2, 2016, the Company granted options to employees,
directors and consultants to purchase an aggregate of 15,643,000 shares of the Company s common stock under the 2007 Equity
Plan. On July 17, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase an additional 5,155,500 shares of common stock. The Company recorded
compensation expense in the amount of $0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with these grants.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded approximately $0.5 million of compensation expense related
to outstanding options to purchase Medytox common stock. These amounts are reflected in General and administrative expenses in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The Company s stock options are measured
at fair value on the date of grant, and compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period. The options granted
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were valued using a binomial option-pricing model using the following assumptions: 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately
$0.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Company s 2007 Equity Plan, which
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.59 years. 

Warrants   

 The Company, as part of various debt and equity
financing transactions, has issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. The following summarizes the
information related to warrants issued and the activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Basic and Diluted Loss per Share   

 Basic loss per share excludes dilution and
is computed by dividing loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income
of the Company. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, basic loss per share is the same as diluted loss
per share.

Diluted loss per share excludes all dilutive
potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the following potential common stock equivalents
were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect was anti-dilutive: 

Note 8   Income Taxes  

The Company recognized no income tax expense
or benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of $2.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The Company applies a  more likely than not  threshold to the recognition and nonrecognition
of tax positions. A change in judgment related to prior years  tax positions is recognized in the quarter of such change.
The Company had no reserve for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

In September of 2016 the Company received a
refund of federal income taxes in the amount of $1.8 million related to the carry back of net operating losses generated in fiscal
2015 to the 2014 and 2013 tax years. The amount of the refund reflects penalties and interest in the amount of $1.2 million, of
which $0.7 million is reflected in general and administrative expenses.

with the Bid Price Rule. 

Pending Acquisition   

 On July 19, 2016,
the Company purchased all of the debt and equity interests in Genomas, Inc. ( Genomas ) held by Hartford Healthcare
Corporation, consisting of 500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Genomas, 345,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of
Genomas, an aggregate of approximately $1.5 million of Genomas notes payable to Hartford Healthcare Corporation and certain rights
to and license participation in technology that is used by Genomas (the  Genomas Assets ). Genomas is a biomedical
company that develops PhyzioType Systems for DNA-guided management and prescription of drugs used to treat mental illness, pain,
heart disease, and diabetes. The purchase price for the Genomas Assets was $250,000 in cash. The Genomas preferred stock acquired
in this transaction represents approximately 15% of the outstanding equity of Genomas. 

The Company has entered
into a definitive agreement, dated as of September 29, 2016, to acquire the remaining equity interests in Genomas for 1,750,000
shares of the Company s newly created Series F Convertible Preferred Stock and the assumption of approximately $0.8 million
of liabilities. Closing of the acquisition remains subject to, among other things, receipt of regulatory and licensure approvals
as well as other customary closing conditions. The Company expects the acquisition to close prior to December 31, 2016. 

Note 11   Segment Information  

Operating segments are defined under U.S. GAAP
as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and are evaluated regularly by the enterprise s
chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company operates in three reportable
business segments: 

Clinical Laboratory Operations , which specializes in providing urine and blood toxicology
and pain medication testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States.   

Supportive Software Solutions , including EHR and medical billing and laboratory information
management systems.

Note 12   Recently Issued Accounting
Standards  

The following table provides a brief description
of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted: 

Standard   
       Description   
       Effective Date   
       Effect on the Financial Statements    
 
      In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued amended guidance related to disclosure about the ability of an entity to continue as a going concern.  
      While current practice regarding such disclosures is often guided by U.S. auditing standards, the new standard explicitly requires management of all entities to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and, if necessary, to provide related footnote disclosures.  
      December 31, 2016, with earlier application permitted.  
      The Company does not expect this new standard
    to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. See note 1 regarding management s current
    disclosures regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.   
 
      In July 2015, the FASB issued an update related to inventory.  
      The new update requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  
      January 1, 2017, with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  
      The Company does not expect the provisions of this update to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.   
 
      In May 2014 the FASB issued amended guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance deferring the effective date of the revenue recognition standard.  
      The new standard introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue recognition and disclosure  
      January 1, 2018, with earlier application permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  
      The Company has not yet determined the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.   
 
      In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that amends the accounting for leases.  
      Under the new standard, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities on its balance sheet for most leases but will recognize expense in its statement of operations similar to current lease accounting.  
      January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  
      The Company has not yet determined the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.   

Note 13   Subsequent Events  

On October 10, 2016, the Company granted 83,333
shares of common stock under the 2007 Equity Plan to its former chief financial officer in connection with a transition and separation
agreement. On October 17, 2016, 273 shares of the Company s Series G Preferred Stock were converted into 606,668 shares of
the Company s common stock. 

On October 14, 2016, the Company received a
letter from the holders of the Tegal Notes (see note 4) demanding payment of the amounts that were due on July 12, 2016 of approximately
$0.2 million, and that the holders reserved the right to declare an event of default under the terms of the notes in the event
the amounts due were not paid. To date, the Company has not received further communication from the holders of the Tegal Notes
and the entire amount due remains outstanding. 

On October 26, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement to purchase certain assets related to a rural critical access hospital, the owners of which have filed a petition
under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Closing of the purchase is subject to open bid procedures in connection
with the bankruptcy proceedings. The purchase price for the assets is $0.6 million, and the Company has placed a deposit into escrow
in the amount of $60,000. The Company has the ability to terminate the agreement without penalty, other than forfeiture of the
deposit. 

The Company has not made the last two required
payments under a senior secured convertible debenture with an outstanding principal amount of $3.0 million, and currently does
not have the financial resources to satisfy this obligation. The Company is currently negotiating a forbearance agreement with
the lender and is exploring several alternatives to refinance the debenture.

and Exchange Commission.  The following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  

COMPANY OVERVIEW   

On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. ( CollabRx ), CollabRx
Merger Sub, Inc. ( Merger Sub ), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger,
and Medytox Solutions, Inc. ( Medytox ), Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company
and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the  Merger ). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate
of incorporation to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. In connection with the
Merger, each share of common stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive 0.4096 shares of common stock of the Company
and each share of Series B Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive one
share of newly-authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, of the Company.
The Merger resulted in a change in control of the Company, and as a result this transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger
and recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
and, as such, the financial statements presented prior to November 2, 2015 are those of Medytox and the financial statements presented
after November 2, 2015 reflect the operations of the combined company. 

We are a provider of diagnostics and supportive
software solutions to healthcare providers. Through continued research and development of our diagnostics testing services and
an ever-expanding group of strategic and interoperable software solutions that work in unison to empower customers, we aspire to
create an efficient, effective single source solution and service for healthcare providers, their patients and individuals. We
believe that our approach will benefit from a more sustainable relationship with and the capture of multiple revenue streams from
our customers. 

Our Services  

 Our principal line of business to date
is clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug
toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. Testing services to
rehabilitation facilities represented approximately  80% and 98% of the Company s revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe that we are responding to the challenges faced by today s
healthcare providers to adopt paper free and interoperable systems and to market demand for solutions by strategically
expanding our product offering to include a full suite of clinical laboratory services. The drug and alcohol rehabilitation
and pain management sectors provide an existing and sizable target market, where the need for our services already exists and
opportunity is being created by a continued secular growth and need for compliance. 

We have
recently added genetic testing, specifically pharmacogenetic testing, to our array of services. Genetic testing represents a rapidly
expanding segment of the global diagnostics market. Growing incidence of genetic diseases presents new opportunities for genetic
testing. According to a report issued by Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the global market for genetic testing is forecast to reach
$2.2 billion by 2017. Increasing knowledge about the potential benefits of genetic testing is one of the primary reasons for the
growth of this market. Other factors propelling growth in the genetic testing market include advancements in the genetic testing
space, an aging population and corresponding rise in the number of chronic diseases and increasing incidence of cancer cases.   

Primary
revenue generating activity in this market revolves around DNA profiling aimed at better understanding the predisposition for
diseases and possible adverse reactions that may occur with drugs that are currently available and/or under clinical
development. Rising importance of early infection detection and prevention, together with growing demand for DNA tests in
pharmacogenomics or cancer genetic testing, are significant factors responsible for this anticipated growth. In order to
further capitalize on this opportunity, we have entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining outstanding equity
interests of Genomas, Inc. ( Genomas ),  a biomedical company that develops PhyzioType Systems for
DNA-guided management and prescription of drugs used to treat mental illness, pain, heart disease, and diabetes. 

We currently
own and operate the following products and services to support our  business objectives:  

Medytox Diagnostics   

 Through our coast to coast CLIA certified clinical
laboratories, we offer toxicology, clinical pharmacogenetics and esoteric testing. We seek to provide these testing services with
superior logistics and specimen integrity, competitive turn-around times and unparalleled customer service. 

Advantage software   

 Advantage is a proprietary HIPAA compliant
software developed to eliminate the need for paper requisitions by providing an easy to use and efficient web-based system that
lets customers securely place lab orders, track samples and view test reports in real time from any web-enabled laptop, notepad
or smart phone. 

Clinlab   

 A customized web-enabled laboratory information
management solution that scales from small physician-operated labs to large clinical reference laboratories. 

Medical Mime   

 Medical Mime offers an optimized Electronic
Health Record ( EHR ) for substance abuse and behavioral health providers, a dictation-based ambulatory EHR for physician
practices and advanced transcription services. 

CollabRx   

 CollabRx comprises our Decision Support and
Informatics business segment and offers interpretation and decision support solutions that enhance cancer diagnoses and treatment
through actionable data analytics and reporting for oncologists and their patients. 

Medical Billing Choices ( MBC )   

 MBC enhances revenue cycle management by utilizing
tools designed to improve documentation and collect information, driving faster reimbursement with fewer denied claims. 

Recent Events   

 On July 19, 2016, we purchased all of the debt
and equity interests in Genomas, Inc. ( Genomas ) held by Hartford Healthcare Corporation, consisting of 500,000 shares
of Series A Preferred Stock of Genomas, 345,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of Genomas, an aggregate of approximately $1.5
million of Genomas notes payable to Hartford Healthcare Corporation and certain rights to and license participation in technology
that is used by Genomas (the  Genomas Assets ). Genomas is a biomedical company that develops PhyzioType Systems for
DNA-guided management and prescription of drugs used to treat mental illness, pain, heart disease, and diabetes. PhyzioType Systems
are designed to provide physicians with enhanced capability to select for each patient the safest and most effective drug to achieve
treatment goals and enhance patient compliance. The purchase price for the Genomas Assets was $250,000 in cash. The Genomas preferred
stock acquired in this transaction represents approximately 15% of the outstanding equity of Genomas. 

We have entered into
a definitive agreement, dated as of September 29, 2016, to acquire the remaining equity interests in Genomas for 1,750,000 shares
of the Company s newly created Series F Convertible Preferred Stock and the assumption of approximately $0.8 million of liabilities.
Closing of the acquisition remains subject to, among other things, receipt of regulatory and licensure approvals as well as other
customary closing conditions. We expect this acquisition to close prior to December 31, 2016. 

On October 26, 2016, we entered into an agreement
to purchase certain assets related to a rural critical access hospital, the owners of which have filed a petition under Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Closing of the purchase is subject to open bid procedures in connection with the bankruptcy
proceedings. The purchase price for the assets is $0.6 million, and we have placed a deposit into escrow in the amount of $60,000.
The Company has the ability to terminate the agreement without penalty, other than forfeiture of the deposit. 

We recently completed the consolidation
of our three Florida-based laboratories into one facility in Riviera Beach, FL. 

Outlook  

 While our Clinical Laboratory Operations continue to account
for more than 90% of our consolidated revenues, these revenues have decreased significantly over the past twelve months. This decline
in revenues has had a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, and is the result
of increased scrutiny of all service providers, lower third-party reimbursement and our status as an  out of network 
service provider. These trends have impacted our entire industry, and have been accompanied by allegations of irregularities in
the practices of a number our competitors and substance abuse facilities. In response, we have put in place a robust compliance
program that we are implementing in all facets of our business. As a result, some clients have returned to us and new ones are
taking note of the compliance efforts we have been undertaking. 

 We believe that our ability to grow our clinical laboratory
revenues and return to the profitability we experienced in fiscal 2014 and years prior are dependent on our ability to secure  in-network 
contracts with insurance companies and other third party payers which will then ensure adequate and timely payment for the toxicology,
clinical pharmacogenetics and other testing services we perform. These third party payers are now generally unwilling to reimburse
service providers who are not part of their network, a departure from prior industry practices and a trend that has developed during
the past 12 to 18 months. While we have made progress in securing  in network  contracts with payers during the second
half of 2016, it has not been reflected in our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. However, we do anticipate
that these efforts will manifest themselves in our fourth quarter 2016 revenues and beyond, and that significant new opportunities
to become credentialed with certain large third party payers will arise in the coming months. This would have a significant positive
impact on our future revenues. In addition, we have made a number of changes to our onboarding policies and procedures to ensure
that, on a going forward basis, substantially all services that we performed will be reimbursable. 

 We have also increased the customer base for our EHR software
and billing products and therefore expect increased revenues in our Supportive Software Solutions segment in the fourth quarter
and into fiscal 2017. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates
on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates
made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon
historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the
circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions. 

We have identified the policies and significant
estimation processes discussed below as critical to our business and to the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed
application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ) on May 17, 2016. 

Revenue Recognition   

 Service revenues are principally generated from laboratory testing
services, including chemical diagnostic tests such as blood analysis and urine analysis. Net service revenues are recognized at
the time the testing services are performed and billed and are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts. 

Net service revenues are determined utilizing gross service revenues
net of allowances. Even though it is the responsibility of the patient to pay for laboratory service bills, most individuals in
the United States have an agreement with a third party payer such as Medicare, Medicaid or a commercial insurance provider to pay
all or a portion of their healthcare expenses; the majority of services provided by us are to patients covered under a third party
payer contract. Despite follow up billing efforts, the Company does not currently anticipate collection of a significant portion
of self-pay billings including the patient responsibility portion of the billing for patients covered by third party payers. The
Company currently does not have any capitated agreements. In the remainder of the cases, the Company is provided the third party
billing information and seeks payment from the third party under the terms and conditions of the third party payer for health service
providers like us. Each of these third party payers may differ not only in terms of rates, but also with respect to terms and conditions
of payment and providing coverage (reimbursement) for specific tests. Estimated revenues are established based on a series of procedures
and judgments that require industry specific healthcare experience and an understanding of payer methods and trends. 

We review our calculations on a monthly basis in order to make certain
that we are properly allowing for the uncollectable portion of our gross billings and that our estimates remain sensitive to variances
and changes within our payer groups. The contractual allowance calculation is made on the basis of historical allowance rates for
the various specific payer groups on a monthly basis with a greater weight being given to the most recent trends; this process
is adjusted based on recent changes in underlying contract provisions and shifts in the testing being performed. The provision
for bad debts represents our estimate of net revenues that will ultimately be uncollectable and is based upon our analysis of historical
payment rates by specific payer groups on a monthly basis with primary weight being given to the most recent trends; this approach
allows bad debt to more accurately adjust to short-term changes in the business environment. These two calculations are routinely
analyzed by us on the basis of actual allowances issued by payers and the actual payments made to determine what adjustments, if
any, are needed. Based on the calculations at December 31, 2014, we determined that the collectible portion of our gross billings
that should be reflected in net revenues was 25% of the outgoing billings. At December 31, 2015, we determined that the collectible
portion of our gross billings that should be reflected in net revenues was 20% of the outgoing billings, and we recorded revenues
at that rate in the first six months of 2016. At September 30, 2016, we determined that the portion of gross billings that should
be reflected in net revenues was 15% of the outgoing billings. These changes were impacted, in part, by certain third party payers
that had, at various times during 2015, unilaterally stopped payments to our laboratories. Those amounts are currently in dispute
with those third party payers. 

Contractual Allowances and Doubtful Accounts   

 Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances
for credits and doubtful accounts, which are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company
has a standardized approach to estimating and reviewing the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including
the period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation
process related to allowances for contractual credits and doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state
of its billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
Receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are
written-off. Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically,
revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to provision for bad debts within selling,
general and administrative expenses. 

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets   

 The Company accounts for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets according to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment  ( ASC 360 ). ASC 360 clarifies the accounting for the impairment of
long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, including the disposal of business segments and major lines of business.
Long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
When necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair
value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management
judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such
estimates. 

 As of December 31, 2015, management determined that its goodwill
and intangible assets were impaired. As such, it recorded an impairment charge totaling $20.1 million. We did not record any impairment
charges for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value   

 We account for warrants issued in conjunction with the issuance
of common stock and certain convertible debt instruments in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives
and Hedging  ( ASC 815 ) and ASC Topic 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  ( ASC 480 ).
For warrant instruments and conversion options embedded in promissory notes that are not deemed to be indexed to the Company s
own stock, we classify such instruments as liabilities at their fair values at the time of issuance and adjust the instruments
to fair value at each reporting period. These liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until extinguished
either through conversion or exercise, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The fair values
of these derivative and other financial instruments have been estimated using a Black-Scholes model and other valuation techniques. 

Stock Based Compensation   

 The Company accounts for Stock-Based Compensation under ASC
718   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Incremental compensation costs arising from
subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. 

 Pursuant to the terms of the Tegal
Corporation 2007 Incentive Award Plan (the  2007 Equity Plan ), which became available upon the acquisition of CollabRx,
an aggregate of 50 million shares of common stock is available for grant pursuant to the 2007 Equity Plan. The 2007 Equity Plan
provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance
shares, performance stock units, dividend equivalents, stock payments, deferred stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based
awards, and performance-based awards.  The option exercise price of all stock options granted pursuant to the 2007 Equity
Plan will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options may be exercised
as determined by the Board, but in no event after the tenth anniversary date of grant, provided that a vested nonqualified stock
option may be exercised up to 12 months after the optionee's death. Awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan are generally subject
to vesting at the discretion of the Committee. As of September 30, 2016, 29,060,206 shares were available for issuance under the
2007 Equity Plan.   

 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to
non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Under ASC 505-50, the Company determines the
fair value of the options, warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Any stock options or warrants issued
to non-employees are recorded in expense and additional paid-in capital in stockholders' equity/(deficit) over the applicable service
periods using variable accounting through the vesting dates based on the fair value of the options or warrants at the end of each
period. 

  Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three
months ended September 30, 2015  

The following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net Revenues  

 Consolidated net revenues were $0.3
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 95%. The decrease is mainly the result of a 78.5% decrease in insured test volumes at
our laboratory operations, mainly due to our status as an out of network service provider as previously discussed, as well as
our determination at September 30, 2016 that the collectible portion of our gross billings that should be reflected in net
revenues was 15% of the outgoing billings, as compared to 20% from earlier in the year. This change in estimate resulted in a
reduction in net revenues in the amount of $1.7 million. 

Direct Cost of Revenue  

 Direct costs of revenue decreased by 82%, from
$1.9 million in the three months ending September 30, 2015 to $0.3 million in the three months ending September 30, 2016. The decrease
is a result of (a) a 54.5% decline in total samples processed and (b) the transition of a significant portion of our testing from
external reference labs to internal processing, resulting in a 60.4% decrease in direct costs per sample. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

 General and administrative expenses increased
by $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of a year ago, as cost reductions implemented in the
first half of 2016, consisting primarily of personnel related expenses, were offset by interest and penalties that were recognized
during the period in connection with unpaid taxes and the write down of our investment in Epinex Diagnostics, Inc. in the amount
of $0.8 million. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses  

 The decline in sales and marketing expenses
of $0.2 million, or 27.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015
was primarily due to the decline in commissionable collections related to the decline in net revenues. 

Bad Debt Expense  

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we identified certain accounts receivable related to our Clinical Laboratory Operations business segment that
were deemed uncollectible. The primary factors in rendering these receivables uncollectible were our failure to obtain preauthorization
from the third party payer prior to rendering services and the lack of an existing preferred provider contract with the third
party payer. As a result, we recorded a charge of $3.5 million related to our inability to collect on these receivables, which
is reflected in bad debt expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, which we do not expect to be a recurring
item. We also increased the allowance for doubtful accounts for our Supportive Software Solutions segment by $0.2 million, with
no comparable amounts for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Engineering Expenses  

 Engineering expenses of $0.5 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 represent development expenses at our Decision Support and Informatics business segment,
which was acquired on November 2, 2015. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  

 Depreciation and amortization expense was essentially
unchanged during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the prior year period, as we had minimal capital expenditures
in 2016. 

Loss from Operations  

 Our operating loss increased by $9.0 million
to $12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
is mainly due to the $5.6 million decrease in net revenue for the quarter and $3.7 million of bad debt expense. 

Other income (expense)  

 Other income of $0.6 million for three months
ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of $2.1 million in non-cash gains on the change in fair value of derivative financial
instruments related to convertible notes and warrants, largely offset by $1.6 million of interest expense, which includes an interest
charge of $0.5 million related to the $5 million prepaid forward purchase contract (see   Liquidity and Capital Resources  )
and $0.4 million of non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of debt discounts. Other expense of $0.4 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 includes interest expense of $0.5 million and a gain on the change in fair value of derivative
instruments of $0.2 million. 

Income tax benefit  

 During the three months ended September 30,
2015, we recorded an income tax benefit in the amount of $2.7 million, as we determined that our net deferred tax assets would
be realized. We recognized no income tax benefit in 2016, as we have recorded a full valuation allowance for all of our deferred
tax assets in 2016, including our net operating losses. 

Net loss   

 Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016
was $12.0 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the same period of a year ago, an increase of $10.1 million. The change is primarily
due to the $9.0 million increase in operating loss in 2016 and the $2.7 million income tax benefit in 2015 not present in 2016,
partially offset by the increase in other income of $0.9 million in 2016. 

 The following table presents key financial and operating metrics
for our Clinical Laboratory Operations segment: 

The following table presents key financial
metrics for our Supportive Software Solutions segment: 

The decrease in net revenues from 2015 is
mainly due to a reduction in the amounts charged by our Supportive Software Solutions group to our Clinical Laboratory Operations
group for services provided. The decrease in general and administrative expenses relates primarily to movement of a significant
portion of our development activities from contracted labor to internal personnel.

metrics for our Decision Support and Informatics Operations segment, which was acquired through the Merger with CollabRx in the
fourth quarter of 2015: 

The following table presents key financial
metrics for our Corporate group: 

The increase in general and administrative
expenses is mainly due to interest and penalties that were recognized during the period in connection with unpaid taxes in the
amount of $0.8 million, and an increase in stock-based compensation of $0.3 million. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine
months ended September 30, 2015  

The following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net Revenues  

Consolidated net revenues were $5.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of $23.7 million, or 82%. Clinical Laboratory Operations revenues decreased from $28.4 million in the nine months ended September
30, 2015 to $4.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decline in Clinical Laboratory Operations revenue is
mainly the result of an 81.5% decrease in insured test volumes resulting in a $25.7 million decrease in revenue, partially offset
by an 11% increase in revenue per insured test, resulting in a $3.1 million increase in revenue. The decrease in the estimated
collectible portion of our gross billings from 20% to 15% resulted in a reduction in net revenues in the amount of $1.7 million. 

Supportive Software Solutions revenue increased
by $0.1 million, or 15.5%, to $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as we continued to expand our base of
software customers. Decision Support and Informatics Revenue was $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due
to the merger with CollabRx on November 2, 2015. 

Direct Cost of Revenue  

Direct costs of revenue decreased by 85%,
from $8.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
decrease is a result of (a) a 63.9% decline in total samples processed and (b) the transition of a significant portion of our
testing from external reference labs to internal processing, resulting in a 58.3% decrease in direct costs per sample. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

 General and administrative expenses decreased
by $2.2 million, or 10.5%, in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of a year ago, mainly due to cost savings
realized with respect to personnel and laboratory equipment during the first half of 2016. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses  

 The decline in sales and marketing expenses
of $1.1 million, or 34.5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015
was primarily due to the decline in commissionable collections related to the decline in net revenues. 

Bad Debt Expense  

 Bad debt expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $3.7 million, as compared to $0.1 million for the same period of a year ago, mainly due to the $3.5 million
bad debt charge related to receivables in our Clinical Laboratory Operations segment. 

Engineering Expenses  

 Engineering expenses of $1.6 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 represent development expenses at our Decision Support and Informatics business segment, which
was acquired on November 2, 2015. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased
by $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the prior year period, mainly due to the acquisition
of CollabRx. 

Loss from Operations  

 Our operating loss increased by $18.5 million
to $24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
is mainly due to the $23.7 million decrease in net revenues for the period and increases in bad debt and engineering expenses,
partially offset by the decreases in direct costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses. 

Other income (expense)  

 Other income of $2.3 million for nine months
ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of $6.8 million in non-cash gains on the change in fair value of derivative financial
instruments related to convertible notes and warrants, largely offset by $4.7 million of interest expense, which includes interest
charges of $1.0 million related to the $5 million prepaid forward purchase contract (see   Liquidity and Capital Resources  )
and $2.5 million of non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of debt discounts. Other expense of $1.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes interest expense of $1.6 million, a gain on the change in fair value of derivative
instruments of $0.2 million and a gain on a legal settlement in the amount of $0.3 million. 

Income tax benefit  

 During the nine months ended September 30,
2015, we recorded an income tax benefit in the amount of $2.6 million, with no comparable amount in 2016. 

Net loss   

 Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $22.1 million, as compared to $4.5 million for the same period of a year ago, an increase of $17.6 million. The change is primarily
due to the $18.5 million increase in operating loss in 2016 and the $2.6 million income tax benefit in 2015 not present in 2016,
partially offset by the increase in other income of $3.4 million.

in professional fees. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

The Company historically had utilized cash
generated from operations and various credit facilities to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and capital expenditures. Since
the consummation of the Merger on November 2, 2015, we have financed our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities,
short-term advances from related parties and the proceeds we received from pledging certain of our accounts receivable as discussed
below. Future cash needs for working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures will require management to seek additional
equity or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to the Company's
stockholders. A portion of the Company's cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain
the right to use complementary technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates potential
acquisitions of such businesses, products or technologies. 

At September 30, 2016, we had cash on
hand of approximately $0.5 million, a working capital deficit of $13.8 million and a stockholders  deficit of $10.0 million.
In addition, we incurred a net loss of $22.1 million during the first nine months of 2016. As of the date of this report, our
cash position is critically deficient and payments critical to our ability to operate are not being made in the ordinary course.
Our fixed operating expenses, including payroll, rent, capital lease payments and other fixed expenses, are approximately $1.4
million per month. Our failure to raise additional capital in the coming weeks will have a material adverse effect on our ability
to operate our business. In addition, we will be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations for the
next twelve months. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the necessary capital on terms that are acceptable
to us, or at all. If we are unable to secure the necessary funding as and when required, it will have a material adverse effect
on our business and we may be required to downsize, further reduce our workforce, sell some of our assets or possibly curtail
or even cease operations, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

On March 31, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement to pledge certain of its accounts receivable as collateral against a prepaid forward purchase contract. The receivables
had an estimated collectable value of $8.7 million which had been adjusted down to approximately $4.3 million on our balance sheet
as of March 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 the carrying value of these receivables was approximately $0.2 million. The consideration
received was $5,000,000. In exchange for the consideration received, the counterparty received the right to: (i) a 20% per annum
investment return from the Company on the consideration, with a minimum repayment term of six months and minimum return of $500,000,
(ii) all payments recovered from the accounts receivable up to $5,250,000, if paid in full within six months, or $5,500,000, if
not paid in full within six months, and (iii) 20% of all payments of the accounts receivable in excess of amounts received in (i)
and (ii). On March 31, 2017, to the extent that the counterparty has not been paid $6,000,000, the Company is required
to pay the difference. Christopher Diamantis, a director of the Company, guaranteed the Company's payment obligation of up to $6,000,000.
For providing the guarantee, and to the extent that the counterparty receives amounts payable under clause (ii) above exceeding
$5,000,000, Mr. Diamantis will be paid a fee by the counterparty equal to the amount by which the amount received under clause
(ii) above exceeds $5,000,000 ($250,000 or $500,000, depending on the timing of payment). 

During the nine months ending September 30,
2016, we repaid a $3.0 million related party note in its entirety, made payments on capital lease obligations in the amount $0.8
million and repaid short-term advances from related parties, net of repayments, in the amount of $0.4 million. 

On July 19, 2016,
we closed a public offering of our equity securities whereby we issued 19,115,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase
an additional 19,115,000 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $7.5 million. In conjunction with
this offering, we also issued an additional 303,633 warrants to cover over-allotments. The proceeds were used for working capital
and general corporate purposes, continued development of new diagnostics processes and methodologies, continued development, roll
out and implementation of EHR and Revenue Cycle Management services, acquisitions and expansion of our business and for the repayment
of certain related party notes and advances, including the outstanding balance on a related party note in the amount of $750,000,
and $2.7 million that was owed to a member of our Board of Directors. 

In September of 2016,
we received $0.4 million from the sale of convertible notes and warrants, and an income tax refund in the amount of $1.8 million.
Also in September of 2016, we were issued warrants from the Florida Department of Revenue for unpaid taxes related to the Company s
2014 state income tax return in the amount of $0.9 million, including interest and penalties. We do not have the financial resources
to satisfy this obligation, and are working with the Florida Department of Revenue to resolve this matter over a period of time
that will be satisfactory to all parties. 

On October 14, 2016, we received a letter from
the holders of the Tegal Notes (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) demanding payment of the amounts that were
due on July 12, 2016 of approximately $0.2 million, and that the holders reserved the right to declare an event of default under
the terms of the notes in the event the amounts due were not paid. To date, the Company has not received further communication
from the holders of the Tegal Notes and the entire amount due remains outstanding. 

The Company has not made the last two required
payments under a senior secured convertible debenture with an outstanding principal amount of $3.0 million, and currently does
not have the financial resources to satisfy this obligation. The Company is currently negotiating a forbearance agreement with
the lender and is exploring several alternatives to refinance the debenture.

The increase in cash used in operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented in the following table: 

The decrease in cash used in investing activities
is primarily due to the completion of the build out of our Riviera Beach, Florida laboratory in 2015. 

The increase in cash provided
by financing activities is mainly due to the $5.0 million received in connection with the prepaid forward purchase contract discussed
above and the $7.5 million in proceeds from the public offering, partially offset by the repayment of a related party note of
$3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $6.5 million received from the proceeds of notes
issued in 2015 and payment of preferred stock dividends of $1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

OTHER MATTERS  

Inflation  

 We do not believe inflation has a significant effect on the Company s
operations at this time. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Under SEC regulations, we are required to disclose the Company s
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Off-balance
sheet arrangements consist of transactions, agreements or contractual arrangements to which any entity that is not consolidated
with us is a party, under which we have: 

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts.   

Any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets.   

Any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to the Company s stock and classified in stockholder s equity in the Company s statement of financial position.   

Any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Potential De-Listing of the Company s
Stock  

On March 16, 2016, we were notified
by Nasdaq that the bid price of the Company's common stock closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued
inclusion under Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2) (the  Bid Price Rule ). In accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we
had until September 12, 2016, to regain compliance. On September 13, 2016, Nasdaq granted us an additional 180-day extension,
or until March 13, 2017, to regain compliance. If at any time before March 13, 2017, the bid price of our common stock closes
at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.
Our stockholders  deficit at September 30, 2016 was $10.0 million. Excluding the valuation allowances of $8.6 million
on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and $8.2 million on our net operating losses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, our stockholders  equity, as adjusted, at September 30, 2016 would be $6.7 million. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

(a)    
        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     

In connection with the preparation of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company's management, with the participation of the chief executive
officer, who also functions as our interim chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )) as
of September 30, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective. In connection with such evaluation, management concluded that
the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting identified in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31,
2015 continued to exist, and as such our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. Insufficient
staffing and accounting processes and procedures led to a lack of contemporaneous documentation supporting the accounting for
certain transactions. The Company is in the process of taking the following steps to remediate the material weakness: (i) increasing
the staffing of its internal accounting department, (ii) beginning the process of converting to a new integrated accounting system
to enhance controls and procedures for recording accounting transactions; and (iii) implementing enhanced documentation procedures
to be followed by the internal accounting department. 

Notwithstanding such material weakness, management
believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects
the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods and dates presented. 

(b)    
        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

Except for the resignation of the Company s
Chief Financial Officer effective September 30, 2016 as previously reported, and as otherwise set forth above, there were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

From time to time, the Company may be
involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings related to contractual disputes, employment matters,
regulatory and compliance matters, intellectual property rights and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Company operates in a highly regulated industry which may inherently lend itself to legal matters. Management is aware that
litigation has associated costs and that results of adverse litigation verdicts could have a material effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations. Management, in consultation with legal counsel, has addressed known assertions and predicted
unasserted claims below. 

 The Company s Epinex Diagnostics Laboratories,
Inc. subsidiary had been sued in a California state court by two former employees who alleged that they were wrongfully terminated,
as well as a variety of unpaid wage claims. The parties entered into a settlement agreement of this matter on July 29, 2016 for
approximately $0.2 million, and the settlement was consummated on August 25, 2016. 

In February 2016, the Company received notice
that the Internal Revenue Service had placed a lien against Medytox Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries relating to unpaid 2014
taxes due, plus penalties and interest, totaling $4,964,020. The Company paid $100,000 toward its 2014 tax liability in March 2016.
The Company filed its 2015 Federal tax return on March 15, 2016 and the accompanying election to carryback the reported net operating
losses was filed in April 2016. On August 24, 2016, the lien was released. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

In addition to the other information set forth
in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
for the year ended December 31, 2015 which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. There
have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K/A. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds.  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
issued 4,974 shares of common stock for the cashless exercise of outstanding warrants. The issuance of shares of common stock
was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in accordance with Section 4(a)(2) thereof,
as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. 

In August 2016, the Company exchanged an
aggregate of $2.1 million of indebtedness and other obligations to various related parties for an aggregate of 5,544,441 shares
of common stock and warrants to purchase 3,123,313 shares of the Company s common stock. The warrants issued have an exercise
price of $0.45 per share, are immediately exercisable and have a five-year term. The issuance of the shares of common stock and
warrants was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in accordance with Section 4(a)(2)
thereof, as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. 

On July 11, 2016, the Company entered
into Exchange Agreements with the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of the Company s 6,451,613 warrants
to purchase shares of common stock issued December 30, 2015 (the  December 2015 Warrants ), to exchange such securities
for shares of newly-authorized Series G Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share (the  Series
G Preferred Stock ) and new warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the  Exchange ). The Exchange closed
on July 19, 2016 in conjunction with the public offering, and the outstanding 8,740 shares of Series C Preferred
Stock and the December 2015 Warrants were exchanged for 13,793 shares of Series G Preferred Stock and new warrants to purchase
10,249,517 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Exchange Warrants ). On July 6, 2016, stockholders representing
approximately 74% of the voting power of the Company approved the Exchange. The Exchange was made in reliance upon the exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof based on the
representations of the holders. No commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting the
Exchange. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.  

The Company has not made the last two
required payments under a senior secured convertible debenture with an outstanding principal amount of $3.0 million, and currently
does not have the financial resources to satisfy this obligation. The Company is currently negotiating a forbearance agreement
with the lender and is exploring several alternatives to refinance the debenture
