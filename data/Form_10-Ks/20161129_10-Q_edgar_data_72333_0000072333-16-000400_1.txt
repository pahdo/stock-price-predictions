NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the balances of Nordstrom, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ). All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a basis consistent in all material respects with the accounting policies described and applied in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report ), and reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are, in management s opinion, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   are unaudited. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   January 30, 2016   has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our   2015   Annual Report. The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnote disclosures contained in our   2015   Annual Report. 
  The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
  Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Due to our Anniversary Sale in July and the holidays in the fourth quarter, our sales are typically higher in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year. In 2016, the Anniversary Sale event started one week later in July relative to last year, shifting one week of the event into the third quarter. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
  Loyalty Program 
  Prior to the second quarter of 2016, customers who used Nordstrom Visa or Nordstrom credit or debit cards were able to participate in the Nordstrom Rewards program. During the second quarter of 2016, the Nordstrom Rewards program was expanded to enable all customers to earn benefits regardless of how they choose to pay. Customers accumulate points based on their level of spending. Upon reaching a certain points threshold, customers receive Nordstrom Notes, which can be redeemed for any goods or services offered at Nordstrom full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. Customers who use Nordstrom private label credit or debit cards or Nordstrom Visa credit cards receive additional benefits, including reimbursements for alterations, shopping and fashion events and early access to the Anniversary Sale.  
  We estimate the net cost of Nordstrom Notes that will be issued and redeemed and record this cost as rewards points are accumulated. These costs, as well as reimbursed alterations, are recorded in cost of sales as we provide customers with products and services for these rewards. Other benefits of the loyalty program, including shopping and fashion events, are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Reclassification 
  Reclassifications were made to our fiscal 2015 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to conform with current period presentation.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which was subsequently modified in August 2015 by ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date  . The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that companies should recognize revenue when the transfer of promised goods or services to customers occurs in an amount that reflects what the company expects to receive. It requires additional disclosures to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. In 2016, the FASB issued additional ASUs which clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, on identifying performance obligations and licensing and on the revenue recognition criteria. This guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact these provisions will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . This ASU increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessee s rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification dictates whether lease expense is to be recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Though we are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions, we expect they will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU impacts several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017. We have evaluated this ASU and believe the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption will be nominal, however, actual results will be dependent on unpredictable events, including the future price of our common stock, option exercise activity and forfeitures.  
   
  NOTE 2: CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLE TRANSACTION 
  On   October 1, 2015  , we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD Bank, N.A. ( TD ) and we entered into a long-term program agreement under which TD is the exclusive issuer of our U.S. consumer credit cards.  
  In connection with the close of the credit card receivable transaction, we completed the defeasance of our   $325   Series 2011-1 Class A Notes in order to provide the credit card receivables to TD free and clear.     At close, we received   $2.2 billion   in cash consideration reflecting the par value of the receivables sold and incurred   $32   in transaction-related expenses during the third quarter of 2015.     Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to offer and administer our loyalty program and perform other account servicing functions. In return, we receive a portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, from both the sold and newly generated credit card receivables.  
  We recorded certain assets and liabilities associated with the arrangement. The beneficial interest asset is carried at fair value (see Note 4: Fair Value Measurements) and is amortized over approximately   four years   based primarily on the payment rate of the associated receivables. The deferred revenue and investment in contract asset are recognized/amortized over   seven years   on a straight line basis, following the delivery of the contract obligations and expected life of the agreement. We record each of these items in credit card revenue, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
   
  NOTE 3: DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES 
  Debt 
  A summary of our long-term debt, including capital leases, is as follows:

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (Unaudited) 

Credit Facilities 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had total short-term borrowing capacity of   $800   under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( revolver ) that expires in   April 2020  , with an option to extend for an additional year. Under the terms of our revolver, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. The revolver is available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We have the option to increase the revolving commitment by up to   $200  , to a total of   $1,000  , provided that we obtain written consent from the lenders. As of   October 29, 2016  , we had   no   issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program and   no   borrowings outstanding under our revolver. 
  The revolver requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ( EBITDAR ) leverage ratio of less than   four   times. As of   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with this covenant.  
   
  NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  We disclose our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets by level within the fair value hierarchy as defined by applicable accounting standards: 
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  Level 2: Other observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
  Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  We recorded a beneficial interest asset when we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction). We determined the fair value of the beneficial interest asset based on a discounted cash flow model using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. Inputs and assumptions include the discount rate, payment rate, credit loss rate and revenues and expenses associated with the program agreement. Given our review of market participant capital structures in the banking and credit card industries and our historical and expected portfolio performance, we used the following ranges of input assumptions to determine the fair value as of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  :   

  We recognized   $5   and   $22   of amortization expense for the quarter and   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   on the beneficial interest asset, which had a fair value of   $15   and   $37   as of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  . Amortization primarily reflects payments received on the receivables sold and is recorded in credit card revenues, net. 
  Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value  
  Financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certificates of deposit, which approximate fair value due to their short-term nature, and long-term debt.  
  We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt using quoted market prices of the same or similar issues and, as such, this is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. The following table summarizes the carrying value and fair value estimate of our long-term debt, including current maturities:

  (Unaudited) 

Non-financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  We also measure certain non-financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill, investment in contract asset and long-lived tangible and intangible assets, in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment. We estimate the fair value of these assets using primarily unobservable inputs and, as such, these are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. 
  During the quarter, the long-term operating plan for Trunk Club was updated to reflect current expectations for future growth and profitability which were lower than previous expectations. Due to lowered expectations, we tested Trunk Club goodwill for impairment in the third quarter, one quarter prior to the annual evaluation. Step 1 test results indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value.  
  In our Step 2 analysis, we used a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows (income approach) and comparable public companies (market approach) to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. These approaches use primarily unobservable inputs, including discount, sales growth and profit margin rates, which are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value analysis took into account recent and expected operating performance as well as the overall decline in the retail industry. Within our Retail Segment, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of   $197  , reducing Trunk Club goodwill to $  64   as of October 29, 2016 from $  261   as of January 30, 2016.  
  There were   no   material impairment charges for the nine months ended   October 31, 2015  .  
   
  NOTE 5: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Plans for our Manhattan full-line store, which we currently expect to open in 2019, ultimately include owning a condominium interest in a mixed-use tower and leasing certain nearby properties. As of   October 29, 2016  , we had approximately   $201   of fee interest in land, which is expected to convert to a condominium interest once the store is constructed. We have committed to make future installment payments based on the developer meeting pre-established construction and development milestones. In the event that this project is not completed, the opening may be delayed and we may be subject to future losses or capital commitments in order to complete construction or to monetize our investment in the land.  
   
  NOTE 6: SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  On   October 1, 2015  , our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to   $1,000   of our outstanding common stock through March 1, 2017. During the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , we repurchased   1.9   shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $93   and had   $718   remaining in share repurchase capacity as of   October 29, 2016  .   The actual number, price, manner and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules.    
  In   November 2016  , subsequent to quarter end, we declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.37   per share, which will be paid on   December 13, 2016  .

  The computation of (loss) earnings per share is as follows: 

1    Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss for the quarter ended October 29, 2016, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the weighted-average shares outstanding has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of loss per diluted share. The impact of these potentially dilutive securities has been included in the calculation of weighted-average shares for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  .

OVERVIEW 
  Our third quarter results reflected our team s substantial progress to align to current business trends and make longer-term changes to our business model. The changes we ve made in the way we operate to enhance the customer experience and increase our productivity contributed to our strong operating performance. In addition, continued focus on inventory led to a positive spread between sales and inventory growth for the quarter. 
  Our third quarter net loss of $10 included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club, which we acquired in August 2014. While this business continues to deliver outsized top-line growth, current expectations for future growth and profitability are lower than initial estimates. To better position Trunk Club s business, we are making a number of operational changes to improve the customer experience and improve operating results. 
  Total net sales in the quarter grew 7.2% and we had positive comparable sales for both full-price and off-price. Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 2.4%, which included one week of our Anniversary Sale shifting into the quarter. The combined second and third quarter comparable sales, which removes the impact of the event shift, increased 0.4%, which was generally consistent with our trends over the past year. 
  Our strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms with the high-quality product and service they expect from us. We continue to make progress in the areas of supply chain, marketing and technology that enhance the customer experience and improve our operating performance. This quarter, we have executed on a number of initiatives to better serve customers and drive top-line growth. 
             
    In our Nordstrom brand, we achieved another milestone related to our Canada expansion with two successful store openings in Toronto, at Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Centre. With Toronto being the fourth largest market in North America, we believe these stores will be among our top volume stores. In the U.S., we had a successful opening of our second store in Austin, Texas, at The Domain. 
                
    Our Rack business serves as a great way of attracting new customers to Nordstrom. We expanded our reach with 15 new store openings this fall for a total of 215 Racks. These stores are complemented by our online offering at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, which is expected to reach over $700 in sales this year. 
                
    A curated product assortment is an integral element of our customer strategy and led to the launch of new collaborations with J. Crew and denim brand Good American. Through these and other partnerships, we are able to give our customers compelling product that has limited distribution. 
                
    Our website platform has been upgraded enabling us to accelerate the continuous delivery of new customer-facing features. From a productivity standpoint, we ve prioritized our investments toward modernizing our infrastructure and implementing the highest value customer experiences. 
                
    In May, we expanded the Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program to enable all customers to earn benefits regardless of how they choose to pay. This represents a meaningful opportunity to directly engage with customers and drives incremental trips and sales. We now have more than 7 million customers in our overall program, up over 40% from a year ago. 
     As customer expectations continue to evolve, it s even more important for us to focus on how best to serve our customers. This guides us on how we set priorities, allocate resources and accelerate the speed of our execution to ensure that we provide a relevant, best-in-class experience for our customers. We have strong momentum in place and remain committed to continuing our progress to ensure we re best positioned to achieve profitable growth.

Retail Business Net Sales    
  In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing customers with a seamless experience across our channels. While our customers may engage with us through multiple channels, we know they value the overall Nordstrom brand experience and view us simply as Nordstrom, which is ultimately how we view our business. To provide additional transparency into our net sales by channel, we present the following summary of our Retail Business:   

   1    Other retail includes Nordstrom Canada full-line stores, Trunk Club and Jeffrey boutiques. 
  Total Company net sales   increased     7.2%   for the quarter and   3.0%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in   2015  , while comparable sales   increased     2.4%   for the quarter and   decreased     0.2%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  . Current period results include a favorable comparison resulting from one week of the Anniversary Sale, historically the Company's largest event of the year, shifting into the third quarter. Combined second and third quarter comparable sales, which removes the impact of the event shift, increased 0.4% compared with the same period last year.  
  Total sales per square foot improved for the   quarter ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  , due to an increase in sales from our online channels as well as the shift in the Anniversary Sale. Total sales per square foot decreased for the nine months ended October 29, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, due to store expansion. To date in fiscal   2016  , we   opened 26 stores, relocated three stores and closed one store  .

Full-price net sales, which consists of U.S. full-line and Nordstrom.com channels,   increased     0.8%   for the quarter and   decreased     2.1%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in   2015  , while on a comparable basis, sales   increased     0.5%   in the   third quarter   and   decreased     2.6%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  . Also on a comparable basis for the quarter, full-price experienced an increase in the number of items sold, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per item sold. For the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , there was a decrease in the number of items sold, partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per item sold.  
  Full-price top-performing merchandise categories for the third quarter were Women's Apparel and Men's Apparel. The top-performing merchandise category for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   was Beauty. The West was the top-performing geographic region for the quarter and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  . 
  Off-price net sales, which consists of Nordstrom Rack and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook channels,   increased     10.1%   for the quarter and   11.0%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in   2015  , while on a comparable basis, sales   increased     3.9%   in the   third quarter   and   4.6%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  . Nordstrom Rack net sales   increased     8.2%   and   7.9%   for the quarter and   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in   2015  , attributable to 21 new store openings since the end of the   third quarter   of   2015  . On a comparable basis for the quarter and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , the number of items sold increased at Nordstrom Rack, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per item sold. Kids was the top-performing merchandise category for the quarter and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  . The East was the top-performing geographic region for both the quarter and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  .  
  Retail Business Gross Profit 
  The following table summarizes the Retail Business gross profit ( Retail GP ):   

  Our Retail GP rate   increased     93   basis points for the quarter ended   October 29, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  , reflecting strong inventory execution in addition to leverage of buying and occupancy costs. Our strong inventory execution also led to improvements in ending inventory per square foot as of   October 29, 2016  . Our Retail GP   decreased     57   basis points for the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   primarily due to higher markdowns in the first half of 2016.  
  Retail Business Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    
  Retail Business selling, general and administrative expenses ( Retail SG A ) are summarized in the following table:   

  For the quarter ended   October 29, 2016  , our Retail SG A rate   decreased     82   basis points primarily due to a shift in sales volume from the Anniversary Sale resulting in expense leverage, while Retail SG A expenses   increased     $39   primarily due to increased fulfillment expenses. For the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , our Retail SG A   increased     55   basis points and   $143   primarily due to increased fulfillment expenses and technology investments. 
  Retail Business Goodwill Impairment 
  We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of   $197   for the quarter and nine months ended October 29, 2016 related to Trunk Club (see Note 4: Fair Value Measurements in Item 1).

Credit Segment 
  As we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD on   October 1, 2015  , and entered into a long-term program agreement under which TD is the exclusive issuer of our U.S. consumer credit cards, our Credit Segment business has changed. With these changes, although we receive a smaller share of available profits under the program agreement, we no longer fund this portfolio alleviating significant working capital requirements (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 1).  
  Summary 
  The table below provides a detailed view of the operational results of our Credit segment, consistent with Note 9: Segment Reporting in Item 1:    

   1    Prior to the credit card receivable transaction, interest expense was allocated to the Credit segment as if it carried debt of up to 80% of the credit card receivables. 
   2    Volume represents sales on the total portfolio plus applicable taxes. 
  Credit Card Revenues, net 
  The following is a summary of our credit card revenues, net  :   

  Prior to the close of the credit card receivable transaction on October 1, 2015, credit card revenues included finance charges, interchange fees, late fees and other revenue, recorded net of estimated uncollectible finance charges and fees. Finance charges represent interest earned on unpaid balances while interchange fees are earned from the use of Nordstrom Visa credit cards at merchants outside of Nordstrom. Late fees are assessed when a credit card account becomes past due. We continue to recognize revenue in this manner for the credit card receivables retained subsequent to the close of the credit card receivable transaction. 
  Following the close of the transaction and pursuant to the program agreement with TD, we receive our portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, from both the sold and newly generated credit card receivables, which is recorded in credit program revenues, net. Revenue earned under the program agreement is impacted by the credit quality of receivables and factors such as deteriorating economic conditions, declining creditworthiness of cardholders and the execution of account management and collection activities may heighten the risk of credit losses. Asset amortization and deferred revenue recognition associated with the assets and liabilities recorded as part of the transaction are also recognized in credit program revenues, net. 
  Credit card revenues, net decreased   $19   and   $105   for the quarter and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in 2015, primarily due to the impact of the program agreement with TD and the amortization of our beneficial interest asset.

Credit Expenses 
  Total credit expenses decreased   $12   and   $31   for the   quarter   and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in 2015 due to a decrease in bad debt expense since the sale of our credit card receivables in the third quarter of 2015.  
  Credit Transaction, net 
  Credit transaction, net of $(32) for the   quarter ended     October 31, 2015   represents transaction costs associated with the sale. Credit transaction, net of   $29   for the   nine months ended     October 31, 2015   was primarily due to the reversal of the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable that were reclassified to  held for sale  during the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by transaction costs related to the sale. 
   
  Total Company Results 
  Interest Expense, net 
  Interest expense, net of   $30   for the   third quarter   and   $90   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   was relatively flat compared with the same periods in 2015. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense is summarized in the following table:   

  The effective tax rate increased for the   quarter   and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club (see Note 4: Fair Value Measurements in Item 1). Excluding the impact of the Trunk Club impairment, our effective tax rate for the quarter and nine months ended October 29, 2016 would have decreased approximately 2% compared with prior year primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax issues. 
  (Loss) Earnings Per Share 
  (Loss) Earnings per share (EPS) is as follows:   
  1    A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, to the closest GAAP measure is included below. 
  (Loss) earnings per diluted share decreased for the   quarter   and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club.  
  Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased for the   quarter ended October 29, 2016   compared with diluted EPS for the quarter ended October 31,   2015  , primarily due to increased sales and margin and a reduction of credit expenses from 2015 related to the credit transaction. Adjusted earnings per diluted share decreased for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared with diluted EPS for the nine months ended October 31,   2015  , primarily due to higher fulfillment expenses and planned technology investments supporting our growth initiatives.

Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP financial measures) 
  We believe that Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share provide useful information to investors in evaluating our business performance for the quarter and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  . The effect of excluding certain items from net (loss) earnings provides management and shareholders an alternative measure to use in evaluating our business performance period over period.      
  Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net (loss) earnings, (loss) earnings per share and diluted earnings per share or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies  financial measures and therefore may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. The financial measures calculated under GAAP which are most directly comparable to Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are net (loss) earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are reconciled below:   

   1    Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted EPS for the   quarter ended October 29, 2016  . The impact of these potentially dilutive securities has been included in the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted EPS for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  . 
    2    The effect of taxes on the adjustments used to arrive at Adjusted Earnings is calculated based on applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to Adjusted Earnings plus other tax items for each interim period. The impact of this tax effect will reverse in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
   
  2016   Outlook 
  Excluding the impairment charge, we raised our annual earnings per diluted share expectations to incorporate our third quarter results, which exceeded expectations primarily due to our efforts to realign inventory and improve operational efficiencies. Our expectations for fiscal   2016   are as follows:

Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ) and Adjusted ROIC (Non-GAAP financial measures) 
  We believe ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and believe ROIC is an important component of shareholders' return over the long term. In addition, we incorporate ROIC in our executive incentive compensation measures. The effect of excluding certain items from ROIC to arrive at an Adjusted ROIC provides management and shareholders an alternative measure to use in evaluating our results period over period. For the 12 fiscal months ended   October 29, 2016  , our ROIC and Adjusted ROIC   decreased   compared with the 12 fiscal months ended   October 31, 2015  , primarily due to reduced earnings. 
  We define ROIC as our net operating profit after tax divided by our average invested capital using the trailing 12-month average. ROIC and Adjusted ROIC are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to ROIC and Adjusted ROIC is return on assets. The following is a reconciliation of the components and adjustments to ROIC and return on assets: 

1    The adjustment for the 12 fiscal months ended   October 29, 2016   includes the goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club (see Note 4: Fair Value Measurements in Item 1).  
   2    Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. Asset base is calculated as described in footnote 3 below. 
   3    Based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases described in footnote 2.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  We strive to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to maintain appropriate levels of short-term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, available credit facilities and potential future borrowings are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.  
  Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position, manage refinancing risk and allow flexibility for strategic initiatives. We regularly assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and other future investments. We believe that as of   October 29, 2016  , our existing cash and cash equivalents on-hand of   $531  , available credit facilities of   $800   and potential future operating cash flows and borrowings will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long-term initiatives.  
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities     decreased     $873   for the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  , primarily due to   $1,297   of proceeds received in 2015 related to the sale of credit card receivables originated at Nordstrom, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital, which includes our efforts to align inventory levels with sales trends. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $578   for the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , compared with net cash provided by investing activities of   $69   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to proceeds of   $890   received in 2015 related to the sale of the credit card receivables originated at third parties. This was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to lower spend on full-line store openings and relocations and our East Coast Fulfillment Center, which was completed in the third quarter of 2015. 
  At the beginning of our second quarter, we completed a review of our five-year capital plan, resulting in reduced spend of approximately $400, or 10%, primarily related to new stores and remodels over the next few years. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities   was   $358   for the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , compared with   $1,820   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was largely attributed to the $1.8 billion we returned to shareholders in 2015 through a special cash dividend and repurchases of common stock as a result of the sale of our credit card receivables.  
   
  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP financial measure) 
  Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. For the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , we had Free Cash Flow of   ($72)   compared with   $702   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  . 
  Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies  methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:

Credit Capacity and Commitments 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had total short-term borrowing capacity of   $800   under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( revolver ) that expires in   April 2020  , with an option to extend for an additional year. Under the terms of our revolver, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. The revolver is available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We have the option to increase the revolving commitment by up to $200, to a total of $1,000, provided that we obtain written consent from the lenders. From time to time we utilize our commercial paper program to fund working capital needs, which has the effect of reducing our available liquidity under the revolver until repaid. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had   no   issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program and   no   borrowings outstanding under our revolver. 
  Impact of Credit Ratings 
  Under the terms of our revolver, any borrowings we may enter into will accrue interest for Euro-Dollar Rate Loans at a floating base rate tied to LIBOR, for Canadian Dealer Offer Rate Loans at a floating rate tied to CDOR, and for Base Rate Loans at the highest of: (i) the Euro-Dollar rate plus 100 basis points, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the prime rate.  
  The rate depends upon the type of borrowing incurred, plus in each case an applicable margin. This applicable margin varies depending upon the credit ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt. At the time of this report, our long-term unsecured debt ratings, outlook and resulting applicable margin were as follows: 
                       
    Credit 
  Ratings 
      
    Outlook

Should the ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt improve, the applicable margin associated with any such borrowings may decrease, resulting in a lower borrowing cost under this facility. Should the ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt worsen, the applicable margin associated with our borrowings may increase, resulting in a higher borrowing cost under this facility. 
  Debt Covenants 
  The revolver requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ( EBITDAR ) leverage ratio of less than four times (see the following additional discussion of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR). As of   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with this covenant.

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (Non-GAAP financial measure) 
  Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of less than four times. As of   October 29, 2016  , our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR was   2.5  , compared with   2.1   as of   October 31, 2015  .   This increase was primarily driven by reduced earnings  . 
  Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies  methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings: 

1    The components of Adjusted Debt are as of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , while the components of EBITDAR are for the 12 months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . 
   2    Based upon the estimated lease liability as of the end of the period, calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. 
   3    Non-cash acquisition-related charges for the 12 months ended   October 29, 2016   include the goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club (see Note 4: Fair Value Measurements in Item 1).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  We discussed our interest rate risk and our foreign currency exchange risk in Part II,  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 14, 2016  . There have been no material changes to these risks since that time. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in the timely and accurate recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of material financial and non-financial information within the time periods specified within the SEC s rules and forms. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  We are subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits alleging violations of state and/or federal wage and hour and other employment laws, privacy and other consumer-based claims. Some of these lawsuits include certified classes of litigants, or purport or may be determined to be class or collective actions and seek substantial damages or injunctive relief, or both, and some may remain unresolved for several years. We believe the recorded reserves in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. As of the date of this report, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Since these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, our view of them may change in the future. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  (c) Repurchases 
  (Dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share amounts) 
  The following is a summary of our   third quarter   share repurchases: 

1    On   October 1, 2015  , our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to   $1,000   of our outstanding common stock through March 1, 2017. The actual number, price, manner and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable SEC rules. 
   2    In August 2016, the total number of shares repurchased was less than 0.1 shares.
