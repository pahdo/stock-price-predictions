REVERSE ACQUISITION

2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis of presentation   

 The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information article 10 of Regulation S-X. 

This basis of accounting involves
the application of accrual accounting and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses
are recognized when incurred. The Company s financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars. 

Fiscal year end is December 31. 

Use of estimates   

 The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Foreign currency translation
and transactions   

 The functional currency of the
Company is the Malaysian Ringgit ( MYR ) and reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollar  USD ).
The financial statements of the Company are translated into USD using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date for assets
and liabilities and average exchange rate for the year for income and expense items. Translation gains and losses are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a component of shareholders' equity. 

Cash and cash equivalents   

 Cash and cash equivalents consist
of cash on hand and highly liquid investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, and which have original maturities
of three months or less when purchased. 

Accounts receivable   

 Accounts receivable are recognized
and carried at original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts
is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as incurred. The Company generally
does not require collateral from its customers. For the period ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company did not write off any accounts receivable as bad debts. 

Fair value of financial
instruments   

 FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value
Measurement,  specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect
assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). In
accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: 

Level 1 Inputs   Unadjusted
quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. 

Level 2 Inputs   Inputs other
than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Inputs   Inputs based
on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements. 

ASC 820 requires the use of observable
market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels
of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of the Company s assets and liabilities was required
to be reported at fair value on a recurring basis. Carrying values of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash, accounts
receivables, payables and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair values due to the short term nature of these financial instruments.
There were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented. 

Inventories   

 Inventories are stated at lower
of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted-average method, and not to exceed net realizable value. The Company writes
down its inventory balances for obsolete amounts estimated on an individual basis for the finished goods and the raw material items
with large amounts, and by a category basis for low value raw material items. 

Long-term investment   

 On October 5, 2016, the Company
invested 958,000 Thai Baht or $27,539 to Vitaxel Corporation Thailand Co., Ltd., a company registered in Thailand, and hold 47.99%
shares of it. The long-term investment is accounted using in equity method. 

Property, plant and equipment,
net   

 Property, plant and equipment
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated
useful lives: 

Office equipment  
       
      10 years   
 
      Furniture and fixtures  
       
      10 years   
 
      Leasehold improvement  
       
      10 years   

Revenue recognition   

 Product sales   The Company
generally recognizes revenue upon delivery and when both the title and risk and rewards pass to the independent members or purchasers
of the products. Product sales are recognized net of product returns, discounts and taxes. A reserve for product returns is accrued
based on historical experience. There was no deferred revenue accrued as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Membership fee   The Company
recognizes the membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is 12 months. The revenue will not be recognized until
the 10 days cooling-off period is expired. For the period ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, all
membership fees were waived by the Company for promotion purpose. 

Loyalty program   

 The Company operates loyalty
program which allows customer to accumulate redemption points when they purchase products from the Company. The redemption points
can be used to purchase a selection of products at discounted price or redeem products. 

The Company allocates consideration
received from the sale of goods to the goods sold and the redemption points issued that are expected to be redeemed. 

The consideration allocated to
the redemptions points issued is measured at fair value of the redemption points. It is recognized as a liability (deferred revenue)
in the statement of financial position and recognized as revenue when the points are redeemed, have expired or are no longer expected
to be redeemed. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the number of points that have been redeemed, relative to the number
expected to redeem. 

As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, there was no such deferred revenue recorded. 

Income taxes   

 Current income taxes are provided
for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences
exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the combined financial statements.Net operating
loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified
as current and non-current based on their characteristics. 

The impact of an uncertain income
tax position on the income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit
by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of
being sustained. Interest and penalties on income taxes are classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes. The Company
did not recognize any income tax due to uncertain tax positions or incur any interest and penalties related to potential underpaid
income tax expense as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Forward Stock split     

 On January 27, 2016, our Board
of Directors declared a 1333-for-1 forward stock split of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.000001 per share in the form
of a dividend (the  Stock Split ) with a record date of February 8, 2016 (the  Record Date ). On February
22, 2016, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ( FINRA ) notified us of its announcement of the payment date
of the Stock Split as February 23, 2016 (the  Payment Date ). On the Payment Date, as a result of the Stock split,
each holder of our common stock as of the Record Date received 1332 additional shares of our common stock for each one share owned,
rounded up to the nearest whole share. All common stock share amounts referenced in this Quarterly Report give retroactive effect
to the Stock Split. 

Comprehensive loss   

 Comprehensive loss includes net
loss and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and is reported in the Combined Statement of Comprehensive Loss. 

Loss per share   

 The loss per share is computed
using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the fiscal years. For the period ended September 30, 2016 and for
the year ended December 31, 2015, there was no dilutive effect due to net loss. 

Recently issued accounting
pronouncements   

Financial instrument: In January
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective
for us on September 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Leases: In February 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-2 ), which provides guidance on lease amendments to the
FASB Accounting Standard Codification. This ASU will be effective for us beginning in May 1, 2019. We are currently in the process
of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-2on our consolidated financial statements. 

The Company believes that there
were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations. 

3.      GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses
since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $2,457,285 as of September 30, 2016. The ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to
meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These combined financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company expects to finance
operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and capital contributions from principal shareholders. In the event that we
require additional funding to finance the growth of the Company s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve
our strategic objectives, our principal shareholders have indicated the intent and ability to provide additional equity financing. 

These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is
dependent on our ability to meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required
to fund operations until sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in its plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at
all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

4.      OTHER RECEIVABLES AND
OTHER ASSETS   

Other receivables and other assets
consist of the following: 

(1)         Deposits
represented payments for rental, utilities, and construction funds to government department. 

 (2)         Others
mainly consists other miscellaneous payments. 

5.      LONG-TERM INVESTMENT   

On October 5, 2016, the Company

shares of it. The long-term investment is accounted using the equity method.

Company Background   

On January 18, 2016, we completed and closed

of the same date among us, Vitaxel SDN BHD, a Malaysian corporation ( Vitaxel ), the shareholders of Vitaxel, Vitaxel

Vionmall became wholly owned subsidiaries of ours. 

Pursuant to the Share Exchange, we acquired
the business of Vitaxel to engage in the direct selling of products and services utilizing a multi-level marketing model with an
emphasis on travel, entertainment and lifestyle products and services and the business of Vionmall to develop online shopping platforms
geared to Vitaxel and its members and the third party suppliers of products and services. 

On January 6, 2016, the holder (the  Majority
Stockholder ) of approximately 78.43% of the voting power of outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, approved by written consent, in accordance with Nevada law, Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the  Restated
Articles ) which, among other things (i) changed of our name from  Albero, Corp.  to  Vitaxel Group Limited 
(the  Name Change ) and (ii) increased our number of authorized shares of capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share to 7,100,000,000 shares, consisting of (a) 7,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.000001
per share and (b) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.000001 per share (the  Share Increase ). The
Restated Articles, including the Name Change and the Share Increase, and their execution and filing were authorized by the sole
member of our Board of Directors on December 21, 2015. 

On January 8, 2015, we filed the Restated Articles
with the Nevada Secretary of State to effectuate, among other things, the Name Change and the Share Increase. 

On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors
declared a 1333-for-1 forward stock split of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.000001 per share in the form of a dividend
(the  Stock Split ) with a record date of February 8, 2016 (the  Record Date ). On February 22, 2016, Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ( FINRA ) notified us of its announcement of the payment date of the Stock Split
as February 23, 2016 (the  Payment Date ). On the Payment Date, as a result of the Stock split, each holder of our
common stock as of the Record Date received 1332 additional shares of our common stock for each one share owned, rounded up to
the nearest whole share. All common stock share amounts referenced in this Quarterly Report give retroactive effect to the Stock
Split. 

On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors
approved a change of our fiscal year end from October 31 of each year to December 31 of each year. December 31 is also the fiscal
year end for each of Vitaxel and Vionmall. 

We are a global direct selling, multi-level
marketing ( MLM ) company offering travel, entertainment, lifestyle and other products and services principally through
electronic commerce commonly referred to as e-commerce. Through Vionmall, which went live in January 2016 for Vitaxel members and
April 2016 for general public, we employ online shopping web sites for retail sales direct to consumers. We do not develop or manufacture
the products and services which we offer. At September 30, 2016, all of our operations, including sales transactions, were based
and completed in Malaysia although we had members in three other Asian countries. More than half of our members reside in Malaysia
and approximately 21% of our members reside in Singapore. We provide our members with training which includes prospecting and closing
skills, plan orientation, back-office training, network management, personal and leadership development and team-building activities. 

Unlike the traditional MLM business model where
most of the business model concentrates on particular products and/or services, our business model allows our members to own a
sub-domain through Vionmall where they can promote their own products and services (separate from our products and services). We
believe that this model is the first of its kind in Asia. 

We strive to differentiate ourselves through
innovation in both our product and service offerings and our sales channels. Consumers can purchase our products and services either
directly from our members or directly from our online platform. Our products and services are listed on our website and customers
can easily purchase them online. Our members need not carry our products physically to their customers, they only need to promote
our products through word of mouth or show prospective customers our list of products online through computers or smart-phones.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our revenues were primarily attributable to the sale of Vitaxel product packages. 

Our Vitaxel packages include product points
(which are exchangeable for tour and travel products or travel kits). Since we are relatively new to the market, our initial strategy
has been to promote our brand awareness by encouraging more people to become members. In furtherance thereof, to date all membership
fees have been waived. Persons that purchase our product packages will automatically become members. 

In furtherance of our membership benefits program,
on November 1, 2015 Vitaxel entered into a Travel Agency Services Contract (the  Contract ) with Ho Wah Genting Holiday
SDN BHD ( HWGH ), a travel agency specializing in providing tour packages, hotel bookings, arranging transportation
and event ticket services. Pursuant thereto, HWGH provides services to Vitaxel s members. The Contract has a term of 2 years
and continues automatically for additional one year periods. After the first year, either party may terminate the Contract by providing
the other party with 2 months  advance notice of termination. Lim Chun Hoo, a director of HWGH is the brother of Lim Wee
Kiat, our Chairman and Secretary and the son of Dato Lim Hui Boon, our President. Lim Wee Kiat is also an executive director of
Ho Wah Genting Berhad, a shareholder of HWGH. 

Our initial Vitaxel products have not generated material demand.
This has resulted in marginal purchases of our existing Vitaxel products. However, following our research and surveys conducted
on the preferences of our members, we have re-packaged and expanded our product packages and the method of selling these products
to our members and our customers. This strategy leads to the formation of Vionmall.  

With the introduction of Vionmall, our
revenue component has been divided into three categories: 

a.    Vitaxel Product packages  

b.  
      Membership fees   

c.  
      Sales from our online Vionmall products   

We believe that the Malaysian and other Asian
direct selling markets hold significant potential. Our results, as reported in US dollars will be impacted by foreign currency
fluctuations as well as global economic, political, demographic and business trends and conditions. 

To create brand awareness and to keep our members
fully informed as to our products and services, and policies and procedures, we designate certain members to be team leaders. Team
leaders promote our membership requirements and products and services through word of mouth, home parties, private previews and
training. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 186 team leaders, approximately 121 of which were located in Malaysia.
We expect to engage at least 65 team leaders in each country in which we offer and sell our products and services. Our team leaders
are independent contractors and do not receive salaries. They work on a commission basis tied to the revenue generated from product
sales. The team leaders promote our products via the methods referenced above. Apart from this, they are required to assist our
management to conduct surveys and research on our prospective customers and members  needs and behaviors. To do this, the
team leaders have meetings and discussions among themselves from time to time. Our obligation to the team leaders is to provide
support, inform and advise as to the availability of new products, make payment (commission) on time and ensure that the team leaders
understand our objective and mission so that they provide the correct message to our members and customers.  

Our business is subject to various laws and
regulations globally, particularly with respect to our direct selling business models and our product and service categories. 

We acquire the products and services which
we offer and sell from third parties. Although, we initially intend to primarily offer and sell products related to travel, entertainment
and lifestyle, we are not limited to those areas and may sell unrelated products and services as long as these products and services
will benefit our members and customers in a manner consistent with our objectives and mission. 

As of September 30, 2016, Vitaxel had approximately
5,827 members, with approximately 4,131 members in Malaysia, approximately 1,141 members in Singapore and approximately 555 members
in Thailand. Vitaxel s members include approximately 1,399 Distributors, 1,990 Supervisors, 67 Managers, 40 Directors, 1,988
Senior Directors, 158 Global Directors, 89 Sapphire Global Directors, 66 Ruby Global Directors, 14 Emerald Global Directors, 6
Diamond Global Directors and 10 Black Diamond Global Directors. 

People become members for a number of reasons.
Some join simply to receive a wholesale price on products and services that they and their families can enjoy. Some join to earn
part-time money, wanting to give direct sales a try, whereas others are drawn to us because they can be their own boss and can
earn rewards on their own skills and hard work. In addition to discounted prices, members can earn income from several sources.
Members may earn income by selling our products and services and their own products and services. The allocation of proceeds from
the sales of members  products and services is similar to the allocation process for independent suppliers of products and
services. Suppliers determine the minimum amount they wish to receive, the retail price to consumers is then negotiated between
us and the supplier and we retain the difference as profit. Also, members who sponsor other members may earn commissions and bonuses
based upon their sponsored members  performance. 

As of September 30, 2016, we have expanded
our network member base into approximately 18 Asian countries While sales within our local markets may fluctuate due to economic,
market and regulatory conditions, competitive pressures, political and social instability or for Company-specific reasons, we believe
that our geographic diversity and intended further geographic diversity mitigates and will continue to mitigate our exposure to
any one particular market. 

We intend to continue to engage team leaders
within each country in Asia in which we offer and sell our products to lead and promote our products. Since we have already established
our name in certain of the Asian counties, we will continue to expand in those countries by providing more benefits to the team
leaders, more attractive products through our Vionmall portal, further training and motivation talks, better information technology
structure and enhance support systems. 

To become a member, a person must purchase
a member package. Member packages include products and points that carry a value that approximates the package price. The packages
do not come with a membership fees because membership fees are exempted for the first year (that is when members purchase the package,
membership fees are waived for the first 12 months). We only collect the membership fees from the second year onwards. Each member
package is available in English and Chinese and typically includes booklets describing us, our compensation plan and rules of member
conduct, various training and promotional materials, member applications and a product and services catalog. The price of a member
package varies by package type and provides a low cost entry for incoming members. 

Results of Operations  Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in Item 1,  Financial Statements , for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related notes thereto. 

Revenue 

We recognized $434,890
and $897,995 revenues for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in revenue is attributable
to a decrease in our sales due to fewer customers in the current period compared to the same period last year. 

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales for the period
ended September 30, 2016 was $312,278 compared to $755,399 for the period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is comparable
to the decrease of revenue, and attributable to lower sales. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit for the period
ended September 30, 2016 was $122,612 compared to $142,596 for the period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is attributable
to the decrease in customers for the current period as compared to the same period last year. 

Operating Expenses 

For the period ended September
30, 2016, we incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $373,725, composed of selling expenses of $80 and general and administrative
expenses totaling $373,645. While, for the period ended September 30, 2015, we incurred total operating expenses in the amount
of $336,740, which was composed of selling expenses of $4,833 and general and administrative expenses totaling $331,907. The decrease
of $4,753, or 98% for the selling expenses, along with the increase of $41,738, or 12% for the administrative expenses, caused
total operating expenses to increase by $36,985, or 11%. 

Results of Operations   Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in Item 1,  Financial Statements , for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related notes thereto. 

Revenue 

We recognized $1,729,802
and $1,751,536 revenues for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in revenue by 1% is primarily
due to the effect of foreign currency translation, or the translation of the applicable foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using
the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate
during the period. The increase of revenue in functional currency, or the applicable local currency, is shown as a decrease of
that in presentation currency, or U.S. dollars, due to the fluctuation of exchange rates. 

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales for the
period ended September 30, 2016 was $1,223,587 compared to $1,678,124 for the period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is
due to procurement cost control. Unit purchase prices decreased as procurement scale increased during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit for the period
ended September 30, 2016 was $506,215 compared to $73,412 for the period ended September 30, 2015. The improvement is primarily
attributable to the change of commission plan since beginning of 2016 which reduced the cost of revenue. The more effective
cost control was achieved by lower percentage of commission offered to the customer. That is reason why both gross profit and gross
profit margin was improved even the revenue was comparable between two periods.  

Operating Expenses 

For the period ended September
30, 2016, we incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $1,305,543, composed of selling expenses of $1,595 and general
and administrative expenses totaling $1,303,948. While, for the period ended September 30, 2015, we incurred total operating expenses
in the amount of $732,230, which was composed of selling expenses of $6,739 and general and administrative expenses totaling $725,491.
Despite the decrease of $5,144, or 76% for the selling expenses, the increase of $578,457, or 80% for the administrative expenses,
caused total operating expenses to increase by $573,313, or 78%. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016,
we had a cash balance of $96,898. During the period ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities totaled $1,188,006.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $120,010. Net cash generated from financing activities during the period totaled
$1,132,924. The resulting change in cash for the period was a decrease of $206,896, which was primarily due to cash used in inventories,
commission payables, income tax payable, and purchase of property, plant and equipment. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we had current liabilities of $2,316,296, which was composed of amount due to related parties of $1,403,508 other payable of $611,012,
commission payables of $265,687, amount due to a director of $24,201, account payable of $6,203 and tax payable of $5,685.  

As of December 31, 2015,
we had current liabilities of $1,523,484, which was composed of amounts due to a related party of $233,100, commission payables
of $537,655, tax payable of $17,586 and accruals and other payables of $735,143. 

We had net liabilities
of $1,794,787 and $1,039,331 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The Company has incurred
losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $2,457,285 as of September 30, 2016, and further losses are anticipated
in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or
obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when
they become due. Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control.
These risk factors include, but are not limited to: 

our ability to raise
additional funding; and  

the results of our proposed
operations.  

Going Concern Consideration  

Our financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course
of business for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately
$2,457,285 as of June September 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of our business raising substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating
profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve
months with existing cash on hand and/or private placement of common stock. These financials do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
result from this uncertainty.    

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including
arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

There are no material changes from the critical accounting policies
set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our December
31, 2015 financial statements included in our Amendment No. 1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2016.
Please refer to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business.

Not applicable. 

ITEM    4. 
                              CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
At the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act.
Based on this evaluation, management concluded that as of September 30, 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
and Procedures  

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but
are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Controls  

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM    1.      LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS   

From time to time, we may be a defendant and
plaintiff in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. We are currently not a party to any material
legal proceedings or government actions, including any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings. In addition, we are not
aware of any known litigation or liabilities involving the operators of our properties that could affect our operations. Furthermore,
as of the date of this Quarterly Report, our management is not aware of any proceedings to which any of our directors, officers,
or affiliates, or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate, or security holder is a party adverse to our company
or has a material interest adverse to us.

AND FINANCIAL OFFICER   

  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY
ACT OF 2002  

I, Leong Yee Ming,

2.          Based
