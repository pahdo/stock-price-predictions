30 September 2016    

1.  

     Nature and Continuance of Operations    

Dynamic Gold Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on 21 January 2004 and is in the exploration stage. 

 These interim consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The Company is an exploration stage enterprise, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (the  Codification  or  ASC ) 915-10,   Development Stage Entities  . The Company is devoting all of its present efforts in establishing a new business, and its planned principle operations have not commenced, and, accordingly, no revenue has been derived during the organization period. 

 These interim consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC. The interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three months ended 30 September 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending 30 June 2017. 

 The Company is in the business of acquiring and exploring mineral properties. The recoverability of the amounts expended by the Company on acquiring and exploring mineral properties is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to complete the acquisition and/or development of the properties and upon future profitable production. 

 The Company s interim consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2016 and for the three month period then ended have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company reported a net income of $20,184 for the three month period ended 30 September 2016 (30 September 2015   net loss of $32,929) as a result of non-cash reversal of income tax penalties of $50,000, and has a working capital deficit of $13,367 at 30 September 2016 (30 June 2016   $62,951). 

 Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that the Company s capital resources are not adequate to continue operating and maintaining its business strategy during the fiscal year ending 30 June 2017. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital in the near future, due to the Company s liquidity problems, management expects that the Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek additional capital on less favourable terms and/or pursue other remedial measures. Management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 At 30 September 2016, the Company had incurred losses from exploration activities to date. Although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan, and is seeking additional sources of equity or debt financing, there is no assurance these activities will be successful. Accordingly, the Company must rely on

its president to perform essential functions without compensation until a business operation can be commenced. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

2.  

     Recent Accounting Pronouncement    

In May 2015, Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) guidance was issued related to revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers and also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after 15 December 2016, including interim periods and is to be retrospectively applied. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Mineral Property    

During the year ended 30 June 2008, the Company acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiary, a 100% undivided rights, title and interest in and to two gravel claims called the Northern Gravel Claims and Super Mammoth Gravel Claims (the  Super Mammoth Gravel Project ) situated along the Homfray Channel at Lloyd Point on the south coast of British Columbia, Canada for $25,000. The Super Mammoth Gravel Project consists of two mineral claim tenures that are approximately 124.1 hectares ( ha ) each in size (total 248.2 ha). The claims are currently in good standing until their respective anniversary dates which are 6 November 2017 (Northern Gravel Claims) and 19 January 2017 (Super Mammoth Claim). The acquisition cost of $25,000 was initially capitalized as a tangible asset. During the year ended 30 June 2008, the Company recorded a write-down of mineral property acquisition costs of $25,000 related to the Super Mammoth Gravel Project. 

 The Company had no expenditures related to the Super Mammoth Gravel Project for the three month period ended 30 September 2016 (30 September 2015 - $Nil).

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions which we believe are reasonable based on current expectations and projections about future events and industry conditions and trends affecting our business. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that, among other things, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation the Risk Factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 including the following:  

our failure to obtain additional financing;  

our inability to continue as a going concern;  

the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in the mineral exploration business;  

the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration;  

our President s and Secretary/Treasurer s inability to devote a significant amount of time to   our business operations;  

environmental, health and safety laws in British Columbia;  

local and multi-national economic and political conditions;  

natural hazards on the Coast of British Columbia, Canada; and  

our common stock.    

  General  

 On January 8, 2008, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Dynamic Gravel Holdings Ltd., a 100% interest in two gravel claims called the Northern Gravel Claims and Super Mammoth Gravel Claims (together the  Super Mammoth Gravel Project ) situated on tidewater for $25,000. The Super Mammoth Gravel Project was acquired by way of a purchase agreement. Mr. Farshad Shirvani has been paid CDN$25,000. Mr. Farshad Shirvani will receive no further payments from the Company. 

 The Super Mammoth Gravel Project consists of two mineral claim tenures that are approximately 124.1 hectares ( ha ) each in size (total 248.2 ha). A detailed report used in obtaining aggregate samples has been filed and accepted by the British Columbia s Gold Commissioner s office in September 2007. The claims are currently in good standing until their respective anniversary dates which are November 6, 2017 (Northern Gravel Claims) and January 19, 2017 (Super Mammoth Claim). The acquisition cost of $25,000 was initially capitalized as a tangible asset. During the year ended June 30, 2008, the Company recorded a write-down of mineral property acquisition costs of $25,000 related to the Super Mammoth Gravel Project. 

 The Super Mammoth Gravel Project is located at Lloyd Point on the east arm of Toba Inlet situated 50 kilometers east of Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada and 28 kilometers north of Powell River, British Columbia, on the British Columbia mainland. The existence of the Super Mammoth gravel deposit has been identified by Lands and Water British Columbia Inc. and has been the subject of numerous preliminary investigations over the years, with the potential to host year-round future sand and gravel aggregate operations with tidewater access. The potential operation could supply growing demand for a range of raw materials to British Columbia, Washington State, California and other United States and Pacific Rim coastal construction markets. The Super Mammoth Gravel Project is situated from sea level to approximately 300 meters in elevation that comprises a sorted accumulation of sand and gravel. 

 10 

On June 5, 2008, a comprehensive National Instrument 43-101 compliant report (the  report ) on the Super Mammoth Gravel Project was completed. The report was prepared in accordance with the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101  Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects  and is based on data and geological information gathered from public sources, assessment files, historical information, British Columbia provincial government maps and reports. The source information of data presented in the report discusses the geology and mineral potential of the Super Mammoth Gravel project and is believed to be reliable and accurate. 

 To date we have not performed any other work on our property. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on our property until further exploration is done and a comprehensive evaluation concludes economic feasibility. 

 Because Dynamic is an exploration stage company, in the event mineral deposits are confirmed as discovered on the Super Mammoth Gravel Project, we will not have the capability to remove and supply construction aggregate. When exploration stage companies discover mineral deposits, which are a rare occurrence, they typically sell their interest in the property to larger exploration, development or production stage mining companies, or they enter into a joint venture arrangement. The larger companies are then responsible for operating the property as a sand and gravel quarry or a mine. If a mineral deposit is discovered on the Super Mammoth Gravel Project, management anticipates entering into a similar arrangement with a more senior mining company. 

 Management s plan of operation is to review the current market conditions and determine whether the Super Mammoth Gravel Project contains targets for future mineral exploration and development. The recoverability of amounts from the property will be dependent upon discovering economically recoverable reserves with specifications which are suitable for commercial products as defined by ASTM and CSA. Considerable further investigation will be required to establish the size of the deposit towards understanding its economic viability, the environmental concerns of the area and the social impact on various stakeholders. 

 Management anticipates the Company will be engaged in the acquisition, and exploration of additional mineral properties with a view to the exploitation of any mineral deposits discovered that demonstrate economic feasibility. Exploitation of a mineral deposit occurs when the company overseeing production processes rock or minerals from the property in order to remove and sell the contained resource in the deposit. 

 As an exploration stage company, we are engaged in the search for mineral deposits (reserves). We are not a development stage company involved in the preparation of an established commercially minable deposit for its extraction or a production stage company engaged in the exploitation of a mineral deposit. 

  Plan of Operations  

 Our plan of operation for the next year is to complete the recommended phase one exploration program on the Super Mammoth Gravel Project. According to his geology report, Mr. Payie estimates that the first phase, consisting of mapping, sampling and a five (5) kilometer seismic geophysical program towards obtaining a model of the three (3) dimensional shape of the deposit will cost approximately $100,000 .  This phase of the program will involve the work of one geologist and assistant for ten (10) days and an additional four (4) man crew performing line cutting for approximately seven (7) days. 

 We will then commence the second phase of exploration. This phase will consist of a drilling program to determine the shape (volume) of the deposit and quality of the material and will take an additional month to complete .  It will entail at least two (2) additional weeks of work for the six (6) man crew which includes a qualified geologist, one (1) assistant and four (4) crew members. This phase has an estimated cost of $200,000. 

 We do not have any arrangement with a qualified geologist to oversee these programs. However, subject to availability, we intend to retain Mr. Payie. He will be responsible for hiring any additional personnel needed for the exploration programs. 

 11 

As well, we anticipate spending an additional $50,000 on administrative fees, including professional fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and complying with reporting obligations. Total expenditures over the next twelve (12) months are therefore expected to be approximately $525,000. 

 There is limited historical financial information about the Company upon which to base an evaluation of its performance. The Company is an exploration stage enterprise and has not generated any revenues from operations. The Company cannot guarantee it will be successful in its business operations. The Company s business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new resource exploration company, including limited capital resources, unanticipated problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. To become profitable the Company will attempt to implement its plan of operation as detailed above. 

 Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve-month period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding. However, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. As well, our management is prepared to provide us with short-term loans. 

 We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. 

 If we do not secure additional funding for exploration expenditures, we may consider seeking an arrangement with a joint venture partner that would provide the required funding in exchange for receiving a part interest in the Super Mammoth Gravel Project. We have not undertaken any efforts to locate a joint venture partner. There is no guarantee that we will be able to locate a joint venture partner who will assist us in funding exploration expenditures upon acceptable terms. 

 If we are unable to arrange additional financing or find a joint venture partner for the Super Mammoth Gravel Project, our business plan will fail and operations will cease. 

  Results of Operations for the Three Month Period Ending September 30, 2016  

 We have not earned any revenues from our incorporation on January 21, 2004 to September 30, 2016. We have not commenced the exploration stage of our business and can provide no assurance that we will discover economic mineralization on the property. 

 The Company reported a net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 of $20,184 as a result of the reversal of income tax penalties of $50,000. Net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 was $32,929. 

 There were no mineral property expenditures related to the Super Mammoth Gravel Project for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company did not conduct exploration activities during these periods. 

 Legal and accounting fees decreased by $3,741 to $1,961 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from $5,702 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Consulting fees decreased by $1,568 to $Nil for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from $1,568 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The Company s continued effort to reduce costs related to charges to file our regulatory quarterly and annual filings with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission resulted in decrease in both legal and accounting fees and consulting fees. 

 During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, an officer and director of the Company made contributions to capital for management fees in the amount of $15,000 (September 30, 2015 - $15,000) and for rent in the amount of $900 (September 30, 2015 - $900). 

 12 

We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 At September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $1,642 and liabilities of $15,009 consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 

 Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve-month period. We will require additional funding in order to cover all anticipated administration costs and to proceed with the phase one and two of stage one exploration program that is estimated to cost $100,000, as well as the stage two drilling program on the property, estimated to cost $200,000. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing and there is no guarantee we will be able to obtain the funding necessary to continue as a going concern. 

  Capital Expenditures  

 The Company expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the period from inception to September 30, 2016. At present there are no transactions being contemplated by management or the board that would affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of any asset of the Company. 

  Employees  

 At present, we have no employees, other than our current officers and directors, who devote their time as required to our business operations. 

  Research and Development Expenditures  

 We have incurred a total of $1,000 in connection with a geological report concerning the Sobeski Lake Gold property. We have not incurred any other research and development expenditures since our incorporation. 

  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  

 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that would require disclosure. 

  Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, and the recognition of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. 

  Mineral property costs  

 The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. 

 Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as tangible assets when purchased. At the end of each fiscal quarter end, the Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment. If proven and probable reserves are established for a property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. 

 Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. 

 13 

Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards. Any charge is included in exploration expense or the provision for depletion and depreciation during the period and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred. 

 Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, according to the usual industry standards for the stage of exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the Company s title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects. 

  ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

 We are engaged in the acquisition of mineral and gravel projects and related activities including exploration engineering, permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies. The value of our properties is related to mineral and gravel commodity prices and changes in the price of these commodities could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of projects. 

 Commodity prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors, including the following: expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies. Mineral prices and the price for gravel has been extremely volatile over the last year. The demand for, and supply of, gravel affect gravel prices, but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities. The supply and demand for gravel is determined primarily by construction and road building activity. 

 As of September 30, 2016, we do not consider the risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar to be material to our financial condition or results of operations as a result of our primary projects being located in Canada and the majority of funds raised and paid to the majority of our vendors are in Canadian dollars. 

  ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 Based on the management s evaluation (with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer), our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 14 

(b) Internal control over financial reporting  

  Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting  

 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting should include those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with applicable GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Tim Coupland, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Edward Burylo, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and preparation of our quarterly financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and believe they are effective. 

 Based upon their evaluation of our controls, Tim Coupland, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Edward Burylo, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

  Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm  

 This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this report. 

  Changes in internal control over financial reporting  

 There were no changes in our internal controls that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls. 

  Changes in Internal Controls  

 Based on the evaluation as of September 30, 2016, Tim Coupland, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Edward Burylo, our Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in any other areas that could significantly affect our internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
