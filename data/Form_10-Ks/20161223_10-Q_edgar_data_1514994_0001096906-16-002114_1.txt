NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

Note 1   Business and Organization

North Texas Energy, Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 12, 2011. The Company intends to focus on re-entering non-producing oil fields and re-starting production with existing oil and gas wells. On February 25, 2011, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Remington Oil   Gas, Inc. ("Remington") to acquire Remington's interest in an oil and gas lease in Milam County, Texas along with wellhead equipment and certain lease obligations.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of North Texas Energy, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 have been omitted.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Oil and Gas Properties 

The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs for unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as oil and gas properties. Capitalized costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical work, delay rentals, costs of drilling, completing and equipping the wells and any internal costs that are directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are generally treated as a reduction in the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, unless the impact of such a reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country.

The Company categorizes its full cost pools as costs subject to amortization and costs not being amortized. The sum of net capitalized costs subject to amortization, including estimated future development and abandonment costs, are amortized using the unit-of-production method.

Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent costs of investments in unproved properties. The Company excludes these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed annually to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the costs subject to amortization. The Company currently only owns unproved properties. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that there is no impairment for the Company's unproved oil and gas properties.

4 

Ceiling Test and Impairment 

Under the full cost method of accounting, a ceiling test is performed each quarter for proved properties. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC Regulation S-X. The ceiling test determines a limit, on a country-by-country basis, on the book value of oil and gas properties. The capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment("DD A") and the related deferred income taxes, may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the Company as of the first trading day of each month over the preceding twelve months (such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties) with consideration of price change only to the extent provided by contractual arrangement, discounted at 10%, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated DD A.  The Company has no proved properties subject to the full cost ceiling test as of September 30, 2016.

Asset Retirement Obligations 

Asset retirement obligations ("ARO") represent the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms, wells, service assets, pipelines, and other facilities. The fair value of a liability for an asset's retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, an adjustment is made to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. The ARO assets, which are carried on the balance sheet as part of the full cost pool, will be included in our amortization base for the purposes of calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. For the purposes of calculating the ceiling test, the future cash outflows associated with settling the ARO liability is included in the computation of the discounted present value of estimated future net revenues. The liability is adjusted for any changes in the estimate of the liability and for the disposal of previously held oil and gas leases net of accretion expense.

Revenue Recognition 

The Company generally sells crude oil and natural gas under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. Revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance as management has no assurance that deferred tax assets will be realized.

At September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $1.4 million that will expire between 2031 through 2034.

Net Loss Per Common Share 

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and "if converted" method. For periods in which net losses are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there are no potentially dilutive shares outstanding.

5 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year and the reported amount of proved natural gas and oil reserves. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known.

Subsequent Events 

The Company has evaluated all transactions through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern. The update provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-15 on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company does not believe that any other recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

Note 3   Going Concern

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations and has generated limited revenue at this time. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. In addition to the offering of securities for sale to the public, the Company currently is diligently searching for other short-term and long-term sources of liquidity for its producing operations.

Note 4   Oil and Gas Properties

The Company's oil and gas properties at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were located adjacent to each other in the State of Texas in the United States and all in Milam County.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company invested $42,544 in the reworking of existing wells.

Note 5   Accrued Lease Liabilities

The Company has an accrued lease liability to KADs Oil, Inc., the lessor of the leases in Milam County, Texas which the Company currently owns. As a result of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Remington, the Company assumed the leasehold obligation of $50,000. Payments are to be made when oil and gas is recovered and delivered to market at the rate of 25% of the sale price after all operating expenses.

6 

On May 10, 2011, the Company entered into an oil, gas and mineral lease agreement for its oil and gas properties located in Milam County, Texas. Pursuant to the lease agreement, the Company will pay the lessor $15,881 for the lease which is recorded as an accrued leasehold liability on the Company's balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Note 6   Equity

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold 238,425 shares of common stock for $476,850.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $500 for subscriptions of common stock. Shares for these subscriptions have not been issued.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

The results of operations show how capital intensive and profitless the oil and gas production business is at start up. The progress so far has been limited by severely limited access to working capital. One of the most important economic factors in the U.S economy is the successful exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. North Texas Energy, Inc. is committing its business and resources to the production of crude oil and natural gas that remains in geological formations in oil fields that have been previously explored and have produced significant amounts of crude oil already. Data and research produced by the Department of Energy indicates that additional significant reserves of crude oil and natural gas remain in fields that were once productive in the past. In previous years and with the price of crude oil steady at about eighty seven dollars per barrel (since 2008), new production methods have emerged as cost-effective in recovering the substantial remaining oil that has not been recovered using standard methods. North Texas Energy, Inc. entered into the business of recovering oil in previously drilled and producing fields in 2009 by acquiring oil and natural gas leases in north Texas. The Company's predecessor operated in year 2010 for a short period of time. During that time, the Company had access to private capital from sales of common stock to shareholders. The capital from investment by private shareholders was limited and sales were terminated late in 2010. The funds invested at that time were used mainly to begin the process of refurbishing wells and preparing well head installations for re-use. The short operations history shows that without on-going sources of working capital, the initial cost of getting wells and drill bores functional to begin the process of recovering oil that remains in the geological formation will not be met and significant delays in recovering the remaining oil would occur.

Results of Operations

Three Months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months ended September 30, 2015

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had net losses of $51,166 and $276,294, respectively.

Revenues

The total net production value of the oil for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $8,374 compared to a value of $4,313 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Operating Expenses

The Company had lease operating expenses of $6,707 and general operating expenses of $52,833 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13,293 and $267,314, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company incurred more lease operating expenses in 2015 due to repairing damaged wells caused by severe weather conditions during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company also incurred more travel expense in 2015 related to the trips the Company's management made to manage the wells and raise funding for the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months ended September 30, 2015

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had net losses of $177,474 and $517,060, respectively.

Revenues

The total net production value of the oil for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $15,050 compared to a value of $15,238 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Operating Expenses

The Company had lease operating expenses of $15,724 and general operating expenses of $176,800 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $88,766 and $443,532, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company incurred more lease operating expense in 2015 due to repairing damaged wells caused by severe weather conditions during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company also incurred more travel expense in 2015 related to the trips the Company's management made to manage the wells and raise funding for the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity

The Company began selling its common shares in accordance with its registration statement which became effective on March 29, 2013. On March 29, 2014, the Company filed an amendment of its Prospectus that relates to the common stock sales extending the time past the original one year sales period. The Company will continue to sell shares as allowed and use those funds for the further development of its oil and gas properties. The Company believes that it can continue to sell its common stock and use those funds as well as the funds it generates from crude oil production to continue its operations. The Company has no immediate sources of debt or equity funding that is not related to the offering of its shares. The Company believes it can avoid accumulating debt or using other non-traditional forms of financing to provide liquidity.

At September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $233,721.

Net cash used in operating activities was $210,510 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $268,621 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The change is mainly due to the Company incurred more costs to vendors and professionals in the prior year.

Net cash used in investing activities was $42,544 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $133,431 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The change is mainly due to the Company spending less in drilling activities during 2016.

Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $472,350 compared to $326,850 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The change is mainly due to the Company raised more money by selling more shares of common stock in the current year.

Without additional investment capital from shareholders or other sources, the Company has no short term source of liquidity. In order to bring wells on-line and produce crude oil and natural gas to bring to market, significant amounts of working capital will be needed to continue. Accordingly, the Company plans to systematically bring wells on-line that have the greatest initial production possibility as capital is available. The Company's illiquid financial position could cause it to not be able to start producing oil in the near future unless working capital from the offering or some other source of short term liquidity is developed.

Management does not believe that the Company's current capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operating activity and other capital resource demands during the next year. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to obtain capital through the sale of equity or issuance of debt, and ultimately attaining profitable operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete any one of these activities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure under this Item 3.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures

The management of the Company (CEO/CFO) have undertaken to establish a system of internal controls that are designed to assure that the Company prepares financial reports or statements that are published are prepared by applying the highest standard of compliance to the rules and regulations that guide their preparation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Specifically, the management has implemented and enforces controls that:

9 

Provide that a system of record keeping is maintained and used to accurately and in sufficient detail record the transactions and assets of the Company and any disposition of the Company's assets.

A.

Provide for the accurate and timely recording of the transactions that are necessary for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States. Further, in place are systems that assure that the Company makes expenditures and collects receipts in accordance with the directives and authorization of management. 

B.

Provide that a system is in place to detect or disclose to management in a timely manner any misuse or un-authorized use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements issued by the Company.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the  Exchange Act.  Based on that evaluation, the certifying officers have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the disclosure controls and procedures in place were not effective as of the end of and for the period covered by this report due to the material weaknesses described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

The Certifying Officers reviewed our  internal control over financial reporting  (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) under the  Exchange Act  as of the Evaluation Date and concluded that no changes occurred in such control or in other factors during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
