     Part I. Financial Information   
    Controls and Procedures (Item 4)   
     The Bancorp conducted an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorp s management, including the Bancorp s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the
Bancorp files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to the Bancorp s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorp s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Bancorp s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of deficiencies in the Bancorp s policies and procedures relating to the registration of, and prospectus delivery with respect to, the
Bancorp s employee benefit plans as described in Part II, Item 2 (Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds).    The
Bancorp s management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Bancorp s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change during the period covered by this report.

     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (Item 2)   
 Refer to the  Capital Management  section within Management s Discussion and Analysis in Part I, Item 2 for information
regarding purchases and sales of equity securities by the Bancorp during the first quarter of 2016.     Shares Issued Under Certain
Employee Benefit Plans     During the third quarter of 2016, the Bancorp determined that a number of shares of Fifth Third Bancorp common
stock offered under our 401(k) Plan were previously inadvertently omitted from inclusion on the corresponding S-8 registration statements, that a number of securities granted under Fifth Third s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP )
and incentive compensation plans were granted without appropriate prospectus delivery, and that deferred compensation obligations owed in respect of the Fifth Third Bancorp Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan may have been required to be
registered. As a result, the Bancorp estimates that (i) approximately 1,080,892 unregistered shares were sold through the 401(k) Plan during the three months ended March 31, 2016; (ii) approximately 178,630 shares were purchased through the ESPP
during the three months ended March 31, 2016; (iii) approximately 768,682 restricted shares and 845,190 stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) were awarded under our incentive compensation plans during the three months ended March 31, 2016;
(iv) approximately 38,828 options and 271,754 SARs were exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2016, at a weighted average option exercise price (or, in the case of SARs, mean grant date price per share) of $13.13; and (v) approximately
$4,902,506 in aggregate deferrals were made under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  
 The Bancorp expects to file the required Forms S-8 and make a voluntary rescission offer to eligible plan participants during the fourth
quarter of 2016 in order to remediate the registration and prospectus delivery defects. The Bancorp has also corrected the prospectus delivery defect in the intervening period subsequent to the third quarter of 2016. Based on the market price of
Fifth Third Bancorp s common stock in October 2016, the Bancorp does not expect that the exercise of any applicable rescission rights will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
