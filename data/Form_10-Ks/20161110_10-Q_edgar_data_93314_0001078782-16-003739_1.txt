  Note 1 - Condensed Financial Statements  
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by VolitionRx without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2016. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years. 
   
  Note 2 - Going Concern  
   
 The Company's financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception of $37,960,827 and currently has no revenues, which creates substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  
   
 The future of the Company as an operating business will depend on its ability to obtain sufficient capital contributions, financing and/or generate revenues as may be required to sustain its operations. Management plans to address the above as needed by, (a) securing additional grant funds, (b) obtaining additional financing through debt or equity financing and (c) developing and commercializing its products on an accelerated timeline. Management also continues to exercise tight cost controls to conserve cash. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
  Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company also regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Singapore Volition Pte. Limited, Belgian Volition SPRL, Hypergenomics Pte. Limited and Volition Diagnostics UK Limited. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $12,527,783 and $5,916,006, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $8,222,995 and $762,187, respectively, in its domestic accounts in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $1,635,263 and $395,100, respectively, in its foreign accounts in excess of the Belgian Deposit Guarantee insured limits. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $2,245,178 and $4,338,088, respectively, in its foreign accounts in excess of the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $nil and $nil, respectively, in its foreign accounts in excess of the UK Deposit Protection Scheme. 
   
  Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share  
   
 The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 260,  Earnings Per Share,  which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. As of September 30, 2016, 1,118,324 dilutive warrants and options and 1,394,243 potentially dilutive warrants and options were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as their effect is anti-dilutive. 
   
  Foreign Currency Translation  
   
 The Company s functional currency is the euro and its reporting currency is the United States Dollar. Management has adopted ASC 830-20,  Foreign Currency Matters   Foreign Currency Transactions . All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses, the weighted average exchange rate for the period is used. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in other comprehensive loss. 
   
  Reclassification  
   
 Certain balances in previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our consolidated financial statements. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  
   
   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
   
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 or the Report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report or incorporated by reference into this Report are forward-looking statements. These statements include, among other things, any predictions of earnings, revenues, expenses or other financial items; plans or expectations with respect to our development activities or business strategy; statements concerning industry trends; statements regarding anticipated demand for our products, or the products of our competitors, statements relating to manufacturing forecasts, and the potential impact of our relationship with contract manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers on our business; statements relating to the commercialization of our products, assumptions regarding the future cost and potential benefits of our research and development efforts; forecasts of our liquidity position or available cash resources; statements relating to the impact of pending litigation; and statements relating to the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Throughout this Report, we have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as  may,   believe,   will,   could,   project,   anticipate,   expect,   estimate,   should,   continue,   potential,   plan,   forecasts,   goal,   seek,   intend,  other forms of these words or similar words or expressions or the negative thereof (although not all forward-looking statements contain these words).  
   
  We have based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about trends affecting our business and industry and other future events. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business, financial condition, results of operations or performance, to differ materially from our historical results or those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement contained in this Report. For instance, if we fail to develop and commercialize diagnostic products, we may be unable to execute our plan of operations. Other risks and uncertainties include our failure to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals to distribute and market future products in the clinical IVD market; a failure by the marketplace to accept the products in our development pipeline or any other diagnostic products we might develop; we will face fierce competition and our intended products may become obsolete due to the highly competitive nature of the diagnostics market and its rapid technological change; and other risks identified elsewhere in this Report, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. In addition, actual results may differ as a result of additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or which we do not currently view as material to our business. For these reasons, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.  
   
  You should read this Report in its entirety, together with our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016, the documents that we file as exhibits to this Report and the documents that we incorporate by reference into this Report, with the understanding that our future results may be materially different from what we currently expect. The forward-looking statements we make speak only as of the date on which they are made. We expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our opinions or expectations. If we do update or correct any forward-looking statements, readers should not conclude that we will make additional updates or corrections.  
   
   Company Overview   
   
 We are a clinical stage life sciences company focused on developing blood based diagnostic tests that meet the need for accurate, fast, cost effective and scalable tests for detecting and diagnosing cancer and other diseases. We have developed thirty two blood assays to date to detect specific biomarkers that can be used individually or in combination to generate a profile which forms the basis of a test for a particular cancer or disease. We intend to commercialize our products in the future through various channels within the European Union, the United States and throughout the rest of the world beginning with China and India. 
   
 We do not anticipate earning significant revenues until such time as we are able to fully market our intended products on the clinical in-vitro diagnostics, or IVD, market. For this reason, our auditors stated in their report on our most recent audited financial statements that our losses and negative cash flow from operations raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our plan of operations, obtain financing and eventually attain profitable operations.

Overview of Plan of Operations   
   
 Management has identified the specific processes and resources required to achieve the near and medium term objectives of the business plan, including personnel, facilities, equipment, research and testing materials including antibodies and clinical samples, and the protection of intellectual property. To date, operations have proceeded satisfactorily in relation to the business plan. However it is possible that some resources will not readily become available in a suitable form or on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. It is also possible that the results of some processes may not be as expected and that modifications of procedures and materials may be required. Such events could result in delays to the achievement of the near and medium term objectives of the business plan, in particular the progression of clinical validation studies and regulatory approval processes for the purpose of bringing products to the IVD market. In addition, at this point, a significant risk to the Company is that it will not succeed in obtaining additional financing in the medium term.  
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $12,527,783, prepayments of $188,922, other current assets of $191,002 and current liabilities of $2,020,163. This represents a working capital surplus of $10,887,544. 
   
 The Company used $6,698,938 in net cash for operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6,480,725 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash used year-over-year is primarily a result of increased expenditures on research and development activities. See     Results of Operations   for more detail. 
   
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased year over year from $122,888 to $89,433 in the 2016 period, mainly as a result of the 2015 purchase of the Nucleosomics    WO2005019826: Detection of Histone Modifications in Cell-Free Nucleosomes patent (i.e. the patent that underlies the Nu.Q TM  - M tests) from Chroma Therapeutics Limited for $55,000.  
   
 Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $13,433,491 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11,294,699 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company raised approximately $13.1 million in net cash proceeds in March 2016 through the sale and issuance of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock in a public offering. In addition, approximately $0.4 million in net cash proceeds have been raised through the exercise of warrants in 2016. The Company raised approximately $9.7 million in net cash proceeds in February 2015 through the sale and issuance of approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock in a public offering at the time of our up-listing to the NYSE MKT. The Company also raised another $1.5 million from further issuances in a private placement during the first quarter of 2015. This resulted in an increase of cash of $6,611,777 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to an increase of $4,712,562 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 We intend to use our cash reserves to predominantly fund further research and development activities. We do not currently have any substantial source of revenues and expect to rely on additional future financing, through the sale of additional equity securities, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in raising further funds. 
   
 In the event that additional financing is delayed, the Company will prioritize the maintenance of its research and development personnel and facilities, primarily in Belgium, and the maintenance of its patent rights. However the completion of clinical validation studies and regulatory approval processes for the purpose of bringing products to the IVD market would be delayed. In the event of an ongoing lack of financing, we may be obliged to discontinue operations, which will adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Results of Operations   
   
    Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
   
 The following table sets forth the Company s results of operations for the three months ended on September 30, 2016 and the comparative period for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Revenues   
   
 The Company did not generate revenues from operations in either the three months ended September 30, 2016 or the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s operations are still predominantly in the development stage.  
   
   Total Operating Expenses   
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s total operating expenses increased by $511,910, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2015. Total expenses are comprised of general and administrative expenses, professional fees, salaries and office administrative fees, and research and development expenses described below.  
   
   General and Administrative Expenses   
   
 General and administrative expenses increased by $22,516, or 16%, in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of an additional office opening in the UK, incurring costs of $21,846 in the period ended September 30, 2016, which was not incurred in the prior year period. 
   
   Professional Fees   
   
 Professional fees increased by $110,741, or 31%, in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was mainly the result of increased marketing, branding fees and business development expenses, as we move towards product commercialization.  

20 

Salaries and Office Administrative Fees   
   
 Salaries and office administrative fees increased by $245,931, or 40%, in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was the result of increased employee headcount, staff salaries and an extra $218,610 incurred on the cost of re-measurement of employee warrants.  
   
   Research and Development Expenses   
   
 Research and development expenses increased by $132,722, or 7%, in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly the result of increased costs of a new clinical study associated with colorectal cancer, offset by a reduction in the cost usage of antibodies. 
   
   Other Income   
   
 No income was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 or the comparable prior year period. 
   
   Net Loss   
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $3,479,140, an increase of $516,514, or 17%, in comparison to a net loss of $2,962,626 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change was a result of the factors described above. 
   
    Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
   
 The following table sets forth the Company s results of operations for the nine months ended on September 30, 2016 and the comparative period for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Revenues   
   
 The Company did not generate revenues from operations in either the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s operations are still predominantly in the development stage.  

21 

Total Operating Expenses   
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s total operating expenses increased by $1,612,346 or 22%, compared to the same period in 2015. Total expenses are comprised of general and administrative expenses, professional fees, salaries and administrative fees and research and development expenses described below.  
   
   General and Administrative Expenses   
   
 General and administrative expenses increased by $46,562, or 9%, in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was the result of the Company opening a UK office and incurring expenses of $48,058, as a result. Insurance costs have increased by $49,248, as a result of higher levels of insurance cover being taken up in 2016. The increases in these costs were partially offset on a comparative basis by the absence of the capital raising expenses incurred in the March 31, 2015 quarter for the up-listing to the NYSE MKT in an amount of approximately $94,400.  
   
   Professional Fees   
   
 Professional fees increased by $305,900, or 27%, in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was the result of higher marketing and branding fees of $158,927 as we move towards product commercialization and an increase of $311,211 in consultancy fees arising from the greater complexity of the Company and preparation for its move into product launch. These increases were partially offset by lower legal fees of $102,797 in 2016. The prior period incurred higher legal fees primarily as a result of the up-listing to the NYSE MKT.  
   
   Salaries and Office Administrative Fees   
   
 Salaries and office administrative fees increased by $440,024, or 35%, in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase resulted from additional salaries of $270,454 due to higher headcount and salary increases. There was also a combined increase in the cost of stock option amortization and warrant re-measurement amortization of $108,334. 
   
   Research and Development Expenses   
   
 Research and development expenses increased by $819,860, or 19%, in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was the result of an increase in antibody and sample expenditures, required for testing, of $628,693. In addition, costs associated with the development of new antibody clones increased by $180,539 in 2016, compared to the prior period. Other increases in costs on a year-over-year basis include employment costs, due to an increase in employee headcount and capital lease interest costs, relating to the new Tecan machines purchased in 2015. 
   
   Other Income   
   
 Other income amounted to $25,891 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This related to grant funds received from public bodies in respect of approved expenditures, where there is no obligation to repay. Other income of $486,556 during the comparable period in 2015 consisted of $146,812 related to grant funds received from public bodies in respect of approved expenditures, where there is no obligation to repay, and $339,744 related to the re-measurement of a derivative liability associated with warrants issued in February 2014. The re-measurement of the warrant liability occurred when 25,000 of these warrants were exercised in February 2015 and when the remaining derivative liability expired later in the same month. 
   
   Net Loss   
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $8,921,134, an increase of $2,077,615 or 30%, in comparison to a net loss of $6,843,519 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was a result of the factors described above. 
   
   Going Concern   
   
 We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing. 

22 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 
   
   Future Financings   
   
 We may seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities, if we deem it desirable or necessary. However, we may be unable to obtain such additional capital when needed, or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such securities may place restrictions on our ability to operate our business. 
   
   Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
   
 We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 
   
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. The Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information under this item.

  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

23 

Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded, as they previously concluded as of December 31, 2015, that our disclosure controls and procedures continue to not be effective as of September 30, 2016, because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below and in detail in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016, and in our Quarterly Reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on May 13, 2016 and August 11, 2016, respectively. 
   
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
   
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with our financial management and counsel, and with the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us. Internal accounting controls and the quality of financial reporting are discussed during these meetings. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by the auditing standards adopted or established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee and the independent registered public accounting firm have discussed the independent registered public accounting firm s independence from the Company and its management, including the matters in the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526  Communicating with Audit Committees Concerning Independence . 
   
 As at September 30, 2016, we did not maintain sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for part of the cash process, including failure to segregate some of the accounting functions and our purchase order process not being fully implemented across all of the Company s subsidiaries. We have developed, and are currently implementing, a remediation plan for such weaknesses, including the uniform adoption of our purchase order authorization process. The successful remediation of these weaknesses will require review and evidence of the effectiveness of the related internal controls as part of our next annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
   
 As we continue to evaluate and work to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures should be taken to address these or other control deficiencies, and/or that we should modify our remediation plan. 
   
 Except as disclosed above and the implementation of a purchase order process within Volition, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
   
   Limitations of the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls   
   
 Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. 
   
 The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
   
  ITEM 1.   
  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to claims, counter claims, suits and other litigation of the type that generally arise from the conduct of our business. We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which our director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 
   
  ITEM 1A.   
  RISK FACTORS  
   
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our assessment of risk factors affecting our business since those presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2016, as amended by those presented in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Item 1A, for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2016 and August 11, 2016, respectively. We refer herein to the March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 10-Q s collectively as the 2016 10-Qs. 
   
 The risk factors below amend, restate and replace in their entirety each of the same titled risk factors in our Form 10-K or 2016 10-Qs, as applicable. 
   
   We have limited experience with direct sales and marketing and any failure to build and manage a direct sales and marketing team effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.   
   
 Our products will require several dynamic and evolving sales models tailored to different worldwide markets, users and products. In 2015, we decided to focus our sales strategy on the clinical IVD market with the CE Marking of our first product in Europe. Pending completion of our review of the regulatory environment in the United States, including the effect of recent pronouncements regarding Laboratory Developed Tests, by the FDA, we may decide to enter the United States market through a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment certified laboratory in the United States. We intend to progressively grow to large volumes of tests sold to centralized laboratories and eventually reach the mass diagnostics testing market. The exact nature of the ideal sales strategy will evolve as we continue to develop our intended products and seek entry into the IVD markets. We have limited experience with direct sales and marketing and any failure to build and manage a direct sales and marketing team effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
   
 There are significant risks involved in building and managing our sales and marketing organization, as well as identifying and negotiating deals with the right sales and distribution partners, including risks related to our ability to: 

identify appropriate partners; 
   
 negotiate beneficial partnership and distribution agreements; 
   
 hire qualified individuals as needed; 
   
 generate sufficient leads within our targeted market for our sales force; 
   
 provide adequate training for effective sales and marketing; 
   
 retain and motivate our direct sales and marketing professionals; and 
   
 effectively oversee geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams. 
   
 Our failure to adequately address these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales and use of our future products, which would cause our revenues to be lower than expected and harm our results of operations. 

25 

Declining global economic or business conditions may have a negative impact on our business.   
   
 Continuing concerns over United States healthcare reform legislation and energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and government stimulus programs in the United States and other countries have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with low business and consumer confidence and high unemployment precipitated a global economic slowdown and recession. If the economic climate does not improve or continues to deteriorate, our business, including our access to the Research Use Only or clinical IVD markets for diagnostic tests, could be adversely affected, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
 On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit . As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the United Kingdom s future relationship with the European Union Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the European Union countries and the United Kingdom and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our ability to market our future products in the United Kingdom which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
   
   Share ownership by our officers and directors make it more difficult for third parties to acquire us or effectuate a change of control that might be viewed favorably by other stockholders.    
   
 As of November 10, 2016, our executive officers and directors owned, in the aggregate, approximately 21.8% of our outstanding shares. As a result, if the officers and directors were to oppose a third party s acquisition proposal for, or a change in control of, the Company, the officers and directors may have sufficient voting power to be able to block or at least delay such an acquisition or change in control from taking place, even if other stockholders would support such a sale or change of control.
