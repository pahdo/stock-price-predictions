A.    General
Description of the Company  

KMP
Futures Fund I LLC (the   Company  ) is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware on November
20, 2006 which commenced operations on January 1, 2007. The Company will terminate on December 31, 2056 unless terminated sooner
under the provisions of the limited liability company agreement of the Company (the   Operating Agreement  ).
The Company was formed to engage in the direct or indirect speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures contracts,
options on futures contracts and forward currency contracts and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions.
Investors holding interests in the Company are collectively referred to as the   Members   or the   Individual
Members  . The fiscal year end of the Company is December 31.   

Kenmar
Preferred Investments, LLC (    Kenmar
Preferred    or the   Managing Member  ), a Delaware limited liability
company, is the Managing Member of the Company and has been delegated administrative authority over the operations of the Company.

The
Company is a reporting company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Moreover, as a commodity pool, the Company is
subject to the record keeping and reporting requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (  CFTC  )
and the National Futures Association (  NFA  ). The Company meets the definition of an investment company in
accordance with guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946   Financial Services   Investment Companies  .     

The
Company allocates a portion of its net assets (  Allocated Assets  ) to commodity Trading Advisors (each, a   Trading
Advisor   and collectively, the   Trading Advisors  ) through various series of CTA Choice Fund LLC
(  CTA Choice  ), a Delaware limited liability company, for which such allocations are rebalanced quarterly.
Each Trading Advisor manages the portion of the assets of the Company allocated to such Trading Advisor and makes the trading
decisions in respect of the assets allocated to such Trading Advisor. The Managing Member may terminate any current Trading Advisor
or select new Trading Advisors from time to time in its sole discretion. In the future, the Managing Member may determine to access
certain Trading Advisors through separate investee pools.   

Clarity
Managed Account   Analytics Platform, LLC (  Clarity  ), an affiliate of Kenmar Preferred, serves as the
managing member for CTA Choice. CTA Choice consists of multiple segregated series, each established pursuant to a separate Certificate
of Designation prepared by Clarity. CTA Choice is an  umbrella fund  having multiple series, each of which is referred
to as an   Affiliated Investment Fund  . Each Affiliated Investment Fund has its own clearly-defined investment
objective and strategies that are implemented by a trading advisor.   

Kenmar
Global Investment Management, LLC (the   Asset Allocator  ), an affiliate of the Managing Member, is the Asset
Allocator of CTA Choice. Pursuant to the Asset Allocation Agreements between the Managing Member, the Asset Allocator, and each
interestholder, the Asset Allocator determines the trading level of each interestholder s assets and reallocates among the
separate series of CTA Choice as agreed upon with the Trading Advisors. Effective December 31, 2015, Kenmar Global Investment
Management, LLC was put into liquidation and Clarity was appointed as the Asset Allocator of the Company. While the Asset Allocator
receives no fees for such services from the Company, the Asset Allocator is paid management and incentive fees directly from the
interestholders pursuant to each interestholder s Asset Allocation Agreement. The Company pays no management or incentive
fees to the Asset Allocator.

Note
                           2.     SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

A.    Basis
of Accounting  

The
condensed statements of financial condition, including the condensed schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2016, the condensed
statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (  Third Quarter 2016  ), for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 (  Year-To-Date 2016  ), for the three months ended September 30, 2015 (  Third
Quarter 2015  ) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (  Year-To-Date 2015  ) and the condensed
statements of changes in members  capital for the Year-To-Date 2016 and the Year-To-Date 2015 are unaudited.   

Certain
amounts in the Third Quarter 2015 and Year-To-Date 2015 condensed financial statements were reclassified to conform with Third
Quarter 2016 and Year-To-Date 2016 presentation. The reclassification did not have any material impact on the condensed financial
statements.   

In
the opinion of the Managing Member, the condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to state fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations
for the Third Quarter 2016, Third Quarter 2015, Year-To-Date 2016 and Year-To-Date 2015. The operating results for these interim
periods may not be indicative of the results expected for a full year.  

The
condensed financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (  U.S. GAAP  ). Such principles require the Managing Member to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimate.   

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
have been omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(  SEC  ) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Investment
in securities consists of publicly-traded mutual funds, which are valued using the quoted price per share on the last day of the
period. Realized gains and losses from investment in securities and Affiliated Investment Funds are determined using the identified
cost method. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the condensed statements of operations.
Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Note
                           2.     SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

A.    Basis
of Accounting (Continued)  

The
Company has elected not to provide a statement of cash flows since substantially all of the Company s investments are carried
at fair value and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy table, the Company has little or no
debt and a condensed statement of changes in members  capital (Net Asset Value) is provided.  

Consistent
with standard business practice in the normal course of business, the Company has provided general indemnifications to the Managing
Member, the Trading Advisors and others when they act, in good faith, in the best interests of the Company. The Company is unable
to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical
future claim, but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.  

The
Company accounts   for financial assets and liabilities
using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels:
quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1), inputs other than quoted market prices
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2), and unobservable inputs for the asset
or liability (Level 3).  

The
Company   considers its investments in publicly-traded
mutual funds to be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1).  

There
are no Level 3 investments as of  September 30, 2016  or December 31, 2015, nor any
portion of the interim periods.   

The
following tables summarize the assets measured at fair value using the fair value hierarchy. The Company s investments in affiliated investment funds are valued based on the net asset value
reported by such funds. By adopting ASU 2015-07, the investments in affiliated investment funds are excluded from the fair value
hierarchy below.

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

B.    Cash
                                         and Cash Equivalents    

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash and investments in overnight deposits. Interest income, if any, includes interest on cash and
overnight deposits. In the event of a financial institution s insolvency, recovery of cash on deposit may be limited to
account insurance or other protections afforded such deposits. The Company has established procedures to actively monitor market
risk and minimize credit risk, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. The Members bear
the risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances,
redemptions received.  

C.    Income
                                         Taxes     

The
Company is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, the Company is not required to provide for,
or pay, any U.S. federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the
Members. The Company may be subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.  

The
Company appropriately recognizes and discloses uncertain tax provisions in their financial statements. Recognition is permitted
for each position if, based on its technical merits, it is  more likely than not  that the position will be upheld
under audit by tax authorities. The Managing Member has reviewed the Company s tax positions for all open years and concluded
that no provision for income taxes or expense is required in these condensed financial statements. The Company has elected an
accounting policy to classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as interest or other expense.  

There
have been no differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets, liabilities or Members  capital since inception
of the Company.  

D.    Capital
Accounts  

The
Company accounts for subscriptions, allocations and redemptions on a per Member capital account basis. The Company allocates profits
and losses, for both financial and tax reporting purposes to its Members monthly on a pro rata basis based on each Member s
capital in the Company during the month. Distributions (other than redemptions of capital) may be made at the sole discretion
of the Managing Member on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Members  respective capital balances. The Managing Member
has not and does not presently intend to make any distributions.   

E.    Interest
and Dividends  

Interest
is recorded on an accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date.  

F.    Redemptions
                                         Payable    

For
purposes of both financial reporting and calculation of redemption value, Net Asset Value is calculated per each Member s
capital account balance after allocations of net income (loss) to such Member s account.

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

G.    Investment
in Affiliated Investment Funds  

The
investment in Affiliated Investment Funds is reported at fair value in the Company s condensed statements of financial condition.
Fair value ordinarily is the fund s net asset value as determined for the Affiliated Investment Funds in accordance with
the fund s valuation policies and reported at the time of the Company s valuation by the management of the funds.
Generally, the fair value of the Company s investment in the Affiliated Investment Funds represents the amount that the
Company could reasonably expect to receive from the funds if the Company s investment was redeemed at the time of the valuation,
based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Company believes to be reliable.  

H.    New
                                         Accounting Pronouncement    

In
May, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07 ( ASU 2015-07 ),  Fair Value Measurement
(Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent). 
ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured
using net asset value per share as a practical expedient. The Managing Member of the Company adopted ASU 2015-07 as of January
1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.

                           3.     COSTS,
FEES AND EXPENSES

Expenses

expenses of the Company are paid for by the Company, subject to an operating expense cap of 1.5% of the Company s Net Asset

B.    Trading
                                         Advisor Management and Incentive Fees     

The
Company indirectly through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds pays the following Trading Advisor management fees (based
on the Company s Allocated Assets as of each standard allocation date) and incentive fees for achieving  New High
Net Trading Profits , in the Company s capital accounts within the Affiliated Investment Funds as defined in their

the Third Quarter 2016, Third Quarter 2015, Year-To-Date 2016 and Year-To-Date 2015, the Trading Advisor incentive fees paid indirectly
within the Company s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds totaled $0, $405, $31,826 and $68,155, respectively.  

C.    Commissions  

The
Company, indirectly through the commodity trading activity of the Affiliated Investment Funds, is obligated to pay all floor brokerage
expenses, give-up charges and NFA clearing and exchange fees. These activities are reflected within the respective net asset value
of each of the Affiliated Investment Funds.  

Note
                           4.     MANAGING
MEMBER AND AFFILIATES   

The
Company s management fees to the Managing Member and operating expense cap are both calculated on the Net Asset Value of
the Company at rates of 6.0% and 1.5% per annum, respectively. In addition, the Service Fees, which are paid by the Company, are
deducted from the management fee to be paid by the Company to the Managing Member.  

The
Company invests a portion of the excess cash balances not required for margin through certain investment funds which invest in
(i) U.S. government securities (which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States),
(ii) any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies
of the United States government, (iii) corporate bonds or notes, or (iv) other instruments permitted by applicable rules and regulations
(collectively,   Certain Investment Funds  ). The objective is to obtain a rate of return for the Company that
balances risk and return relative to the historically low yields on short-term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms.
There is no guarantee that the Managing Member will be successful in investing the excess cash successfully to obtain a greater
yield than available on short-term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms.   

The
Managing Member is paid monthly 1/12 th  of 50% of the first 1% of the positive returns earned on the Company s
investments in Certain Investment Funds. The calculation is based on the Company s average annualized Net Asset Value,
and any losses related to returns on Certain Investment Funds must first be recovered through subsequent positive returns prior
to the Managing Member receiving a payment.    After
the calculation of the amount payable to the Managing Member, the Company will be credited with all additional positive returns
(or 100% of any losses) on the Company s investments in Certain Investment Funds. If at the end of any calendar year, a
loss has been incurred on the returns for Certain Investment Funds, then the loss carry-forward will reset to zero for the next
calendar year with regards to the calculation of the Managing Member s portion of Certain Investment Fund s income.
 As of September 30, 2016, the loss carry-forward amounted to $0 . For the Third Quarter
2016, Third Quarter 2015, Year-To-Date 2016 and Year-To-Date 2015, the Managing Member s portion of interest earned on Certain
Investment Funds amounted to $7,504, $0, $25,029 and $9,743, respectively.

The
following tables summarize the change in net asset value (fair value) of the Company s investment in Affiliated Investment
Funds for the  Year-To-Date 2016  and the  Year-To-Date
2015 :  

The
Affiliated Investment Funds are redeemable monthly and require a redemption notice of 1-5 days. The Company may make additional
contributions to or redemptions from the Affiliated Investment Funds on a standard allocation date. The Affiliated Investment
Funds engage in trading commodity futures including agricultural, currency, energy, interest rates and stock indices among other

The
Company records its proportionate share of income or loss in the condensed statements of operations.  

Prior
to May 1, 2015, the Company s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds was not fully funded, but was subject to additional
capital calls up to the full amount of the capital commitment. Effective May 1, 2015, in accordance with the amendment to CTA
Choice s Private Placement Memorandum, the full amount of the Company s capital contribution to an Affiliated Investment
Fund will be funded by each Trading Advisor pursuant to its trading strategy at the Affiliated Investment Fund s Investment
Level Factor. An Affiliated Investment Fund s Investment Level Factor multiplied by the capital contribution of the Company
to an Affiliated Investment Fund shall equal the Company s Investment Level.

No
 derivative instruments were directly held by the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. Derivative trading activity is conducted within the Affiliated Investment Funds.   

The
Company s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds is subject to the market and credit risks of the futures contracts,
options on futures contracts, forward currency contracts and other financial instruments held or sold short by them. The Company
bears the risk of loss only to the extent of the capital commitment of its investment and, in certain specific circumstances,
distributions and redemptions received.  

The
Company is exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it indirectly
invests through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds. These risks include, but are not limited to, risk of loss from
fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held (market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the
terms of the Company s investment activities (credit risk), including investment in Affiliated Investment Funds.  

The
Managing Member has established procedures to actively monitor market risk and minimize credit risk, although there can be no
assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. The Members bear the risk of loss only to the extent of the market value
of their respective interests in the Company and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.  

Market
Risk   

Market
risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government programs and policies, political and economic events, the
level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the diversification effect among the derivative instruments
the Company holds and the liquidity and inherent volatility of the markets in which the Company indirectly invests through its
ownership in Affiliated Investment Funds.  

Credit
Risk   

The
Managing Member attempts to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring the Company and its Trading Advisors to abide by
various trading limitations and policies. The Managing Member monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies,
which include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties; limiting the amount
of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally limiting transactions to contracts
which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions.

Introduction   

General    

KMP
Futures Fund I LLC (the   Registrant  ) is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware on
November 20, 2006 which commenced operations on January 1, 2007. The Registrant will terminate on December 31, 2056 unless terminated
sooner under the provisions of the limited liability company agreement of the Registrant (the   Operating Agreement  ).
The Registrant was formed to engage in the direct or indirect speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures contracts,
options on futures contracts and forward currency contracts and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions.
Investors holding interests in the Registrant are collectively referred to herein as the   Members   or the   Individual
Members  . The fiscal year end of the Registrant is December 31.  

Effective
November, 2009, the Registrant became a reporting company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange
Act  ). Moreover, as a commodity pool, the Registrant became subject to the record keeping and reporting requirements
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (  CFTC  ) and the National Futures Association (  NFA  ).  

The
Registrant s Objectives    

The
Registrant s objectives are:  

Significant
                                         profits over time;  

Performance
                                         volatility commensurate with profit potential;  

Controlled
                                         risk of loss; and  

Diversification
                                         within a traditional portfolio, typically consisting entirely of  long  equity
                                         and debt positions and reduced dependence on a single nation s economy, by accessing
                                         global financial, commodity and other non-financial futures markets.  

The
Registrant s potential for aggressive capital growth arises from the profit possibilities offered by the global futures,
forward and options markets and the skills of the professional trading organization(s) selected to manage the assets of the Registrant.
The fact that the Registrant can profit from both rising and falling markets adds an element of profit potential that is not present
in long-only strategies. However, the Registrant can also incur losses from both rising and falling markets that adds to the risk
of loss. In addition to its profit potential and risk of loss, the Registrant also could help reduce the overall volatility, or
risk, of a portfolio. By investing in markets that operate independently from U.S. stock and bond markets (and therefore, may
be considered as non-correlated), the Registrant may provide positive returns even when U.S. stock and bond markets are experiencing
flat to negative performance and may provide negative returns even when U.S. stock and bond markets are experiencing flat to positive
performance. Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance would be exactly opposite
between the Registrant and U.S. stock and bond markets.  

The
Managing Member makes no guarantee that the investment objectives for the Registrant will be achieved.  

Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

        Table of Contents  

Managing
Member and its Affiliates    

Kenmar
Preferred Investments, LLC (  Kenmar Preferred   or the   Managing Member  ) is the managing
member of the Registrant, and has administrative authority over the operations of the Registrant.  

The
Managing Member s predecessor and affiliates have been sponsoring and managing single and multi-advisor funds for over two
decades. Effective April 1, 2016, the principal office of the Registrant is c/o Kenmar Preferred Investments, LLC, 680 Fifth Avenue,
Suite 1901, New York, New York 10019. Prior to April 1, 2016, the principal office of the Registrant was 1211 Avenue of the Americas,
Suite 2701, New York, New York 10036. The telephone number of the Registrant and the Managing Member is (914) 307-7000.  

The
Managing Member has substantial experience in selecting and monitoring Trading Advisors, asset allocation and overall portfolio
design using quantitative and qualitative methods.  

The
Managing Member monitors the trading activity and performance of the Trading Advisors and adjusts the overall leverage at which
the Registrant trades. The commitment of the Registrant to the Trading Advisors may exceed 100% of the Registrant s total
equity if the Managing Member decides to strategically allocate notional equity to such Trading Advisors. This may result in increased
profits or larger losses than would otherwise result. There likely will be periods in the markets during which it is unlikely
that the Trading Advisors will be profitable. By having the ability to deleverage the Registrant s market commitment to
below its actual equity during such periods, the Managing Member could help preserve capital while awaiting more favorable market
cycles.  

The
Managing Member also performs ongoing due diligence with respect to the Trading Advisors. If the Managing Member determines that
the Trading Advisors have departed from its program or stated trading methodology or has exceeded its stated risk parameters,
the Managing Member, on behalf of the Registrant, will take such actions as it deems appropriate, which may include terminating
the Trading Advisors. Similarly, if the Managing Member s ongoing due diligence leads the Managing Member to determine that
it is in the best interests of the Registrant to add an additional trading advisor; it will do so in its sole discretion. If the
Managing Member concludes, based upon its perception of market or economic conditions, that it is appropriate to allocate assets
of the Registrant to a different trading program run by the Trading Advisors, it will do so. The Managing Member may select a
replacement if any of the Trading Advisors resign or are terminated, or may select additional Trading Advisors at its discretion.  

The
Trading Advisors    

The
Registrant allocates a portion of its net assets (  Allocated Assets  ) to commodity Trading Advisors (each,
a   Trading Advisor   and collectively, the   Trading Advisors  ). Each Trading Advisor manages
the portion of the assets of the Registrant allocated to such Trading Advisor and makes the trading decisions in respect of the
assets allocated to such Trading Advisor. The Managing Member may terminate any current Trading Advisor or select new Trading
Advisors from time to time in its sole discretion. In the future, the Managing Member may determine to access certain Trading
Advisors through separate investee pools.  

In
general, the Registrant expects to access the Trading Advisors through various series of CTA Choice Fund LLC (  CTA Choice  ).
CTA Choice is an  umbrella fund  having multiple segregated series, each of which is referred to herein as a   CTA
Fund   or an   Affiliated Investment Fund  . Each CTA Fund has its own clearly-defined investment objective
and strategies that are implemented by a Trading Advisor. Clarity Managed Account   Analytics Platform, LLC (  Clarity  )
an affiliate of Kenmar Preferred, serves as the managing member for CTA Choice. Until April 30, 2015, the Registrant allocated
approximately one-half of its Allocated Assets to each of the following CTA Funds:  

CTA
                                         Choice WTN  ( WTN ) , managed by Winton Capital Management Limited (  Winton  ),
                                         pursuant to its Diversified Program, which is a systematic, technical diversified program;
                                         and    

CTA
                                         Choice EGLG  ( EGLG ) , managed by Eagle Trading Systems Inc. (  Eagle  ),
                                         pursuant to its Global Program, which is a systematic, technical long term diversified
                                         program.    

Effective
May 1, 2015, the Registrant allocates approximately one-half of its Allocated Assets to each WTN and CTA Choice QNTM (  QNTM  ),
which is managed by Quantmetrics Capital Management LLP (  Quantmetrics  ) pursuant to its QM Multi Strategy
Program, after fully redeeming from EGLG.  

Effective
January 1, 2016, the Registrant allocates approximately one-half of its Allocated Assets to each CTA Choice ISAT  ( ISAT )
 managed by Deep Field Capital AG (  Deep Field  ), pursuant to its Singularity Managed Futures Program and
CTA Choice KEY  ( KEY ) , managed by KeyQuant S.A.S (  KeyQuant  ), pursuant to its Key Trends
Program, after fully redeeming from QNTM and WTN on December 31, 2015.

Winton s
Diversified Program employs a computer-based system to engage in the speculative trading of international futures, options and
forwards markets, government securities such as bonds, as well as certain over the counter (  OTC  ) instruments,
which may include foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts and swaps. Winton seeks to combine highly liquid financial
instruments offering positive but low Sharpe ratios (meaning that profits have been achieved with a certain level of risk) and
generally low correlation over the long term to other markets such as equities and fixed income.  

Eagle s
Global Program is a technical, trend-following system developed, based on Eagle s extensive experience in observing and
trading the global markets, to capture a well-structured trading philosophy. The trading philosophy incorporates trend following
elements, money management principles, predetermined risk parameters and volatility adjustment features. The system is designed
to trade in a wide range of global futures markets - currencies, fixed income, energies, commodities and stock indices - that
exhibit orderly intermediate and long-term trends, and adjust to changes in market environment with no predetermined allocation
to any one sector. Eagle analyzes typical behavior and volatility patterns of various markets. The system seeks markets with potentially
good risk/reward profiles while attempting to avoid markets characterized by excessive volatility and sharp price corrections.
An attempt is made to participate in markets which exhibit favorable  signal to noise  characteristics. Money management
and risk control disciplines serve to attempt to limit downside risk.  

Quantmetrics 
QM Multi Strategy Program follows the QM Directional Strategy and the QM Premier Strategy. The QM Directional Strategy is a quantitative
short term directional futures strategy. The strategy trades futures and foreign exchange with a holding period ranging from 5
minutes to a few days. The aim is to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation by realizing many short-term gains
across a number of different asset classes. The investment approach identifies and captures market inefficiencies using statistical
and econometric models. As the models selectively choose the timing of the trades, it is ideally positioned to benefit from liquidity
driven price shocks. The QM Premier Strategy is a quantitative market neutral futures strategy. The strategy trades futures with
a holding period from 20 minutes to 1 day. The aim is to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation by seeking to profit
from short term liquidity imbalances in pairs of equity index futures. The investment approach identifies and captures market
inefficiencies using statistical and econometric models. Disciplined risk management is built into each trading algorithm, with
time stops strictly adhered to.  

KeyQuant s
Key Trends program is a medium to long-term trend following trading program. Analysis allows capturing major economic cycles.
The Trading Program aims to profit more from market trends thanks to its continuous analysis of trends. Moreover, the Trading
Program offers a unique portfolio allocation mechanism known as the GEF. In the case of an uncertain economic scenario, the GEF
systematically adjusts the volatility target downwards to account for uncertainty in trends.  

Deep
Field s Singularity Managed Futures Program is a fully automated managed futures program which executes a purely systematic
trading approach using quantitative analysis of real-time price data to detect market trends. The highly reactive system trades
liquid futures markets, across all asset classes: equities, fixed income, commodities and FX. Singularity Managed Futures Program s
objective is to achieve appreciation of clients  assets through speculative trading in the US and non-US futures contracts. 
The investment strategies employed in the Program are technical rather than fundamental in nature, i.e., they are developed from
analysis of patterns of actual monthly, weekly, and daily price movements and are not based on analysis of fundamental factors
such as supply and demand, general economic conditions or anticipated world events.  The Program relies on historical analysis
of these price patterns to interpret current market behaviour and to evaluate technical indicators for trade initiations and liquidations.  

The
Administrator    

SS C
GlobeOp Financial Services LLC (  SS C GlobeOp   or the   Administrator  ), a Delaware limited
liability company located at One South Road, Harrison, NY 10528, has been retained by the Registrant to serve as the Registrant s

Fees
and Expenses   

Management
Fee    

The
Registrant pays the Managing Member in advance a monthly management fee equal to 1/12 th  of 6.00% (6.00% per annum)
of the Registrant s Net Asset Value (defined below) at the beginning of each month, See Note 4 of the Registrant s
financial statements included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the   Registrant s 2015
Annual Report  ), which is filed as an exhibit to the Registrant s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015.  

Net
Asset Value   is the total assets of the Registrant less total liabilities of the Registrant, each determined on the
basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
Registrant, indirectly through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds, pays a monthly administrative services fee in the
amount of 1/12 th  of 0.25% (0.25% per annum) of the respective CTA Fund s beginning of month Allocated Assets
to Clarity for risk management and related services with respect to monitoring the Trading Advisors.  

Trading
Advisors  Fees    

The
Registrant, indirectly through its investment in the Affiliated Investment Funds, pays Deep Field, KeyQuant, Winton, Eagle and
Quantmetrics monthly management fees at an annual rate of 0.25%, 1%, 1.5%, 2% and 1%, respectively, as defined in their respective
Trading Advisory Agreements.  

The
Registrant, indirectly through its investment in the Affiliated Investment Funds, pays Deep Field, KeyQuant, Winton, Eagle and
Quantmetrics an incentive fee accrued monthly and paid quarterly of 30%, 20%, 20%, 25% and 25%, respectively, for achieving New
High Net Trading Profits as defined below.  

New
High Net Trading Profits   (for purposes of calculating a Trading Advisor s incentive fees) will be accrued monthly
and paid as of the close of business of the last day of each calendar quarter (the   Incentive Measurement Date  )
and will include such profits (as outlined below) since the immediately preceding Incentive Measurement Date (or, with respect
to the first Incentive Measurement Date, since commencement of operations of the Registrant or the date the Trading Advisor commenced
trading activities for the Registrant), each an Incentive Measurement Period. New High Net Trading Profits for any Incentive Measurement
Period will be the net profits, if any, from the Trading Advisor s trading during such period (including (i) realized trading
profit (loss) plus or minus (ii) the change in unrealized trading profit (loss) on open positions), and will be calculated after
the determination of certain transaction costs attributable to the Trading Advisor s trading activities, operating expenses
and the Trading Advisor s management fee, but before deduction of any incentive fees payable during the Incentive Measurement
Period. New High Net Trading Profits will not include interest earned or credited on the assets allocated to the Trading Advisor.  

New
High Net Trading Profits will be generated only to the extent that the cumulative New High Net Trading Profits achieved by the
Trading Advisor exceed the highest level of cumulative New High Net Trading Profits achieved by such Trading Advisor as of a previous
Incentive Measurement Date. Except as set forth below, net losses from prior months must be recouped before New High Net Trading
Profits can again be generated.  

If
a withdrawal or distribution occurs or if a Trading Advisor s advisory agreement with the relevant CTA Fund is terminated
at any date that is not an Incentive Measurement Date, the date of the withdrawal or distribution or termination will be treated
as if it were an Incentive Measurement Date. New High Net Trading Profits for an Incentive Measurement Period shall exclude capital
contributions allocated to the Trading Advisor in an Incentive Measurement Period, distributions or redemptions paid or payable
from the Trading Advisor s account during an Incentive Measurement Period and any loss carry-forward attributable to the
Trading Advisor will be reduced in the same proportion that the value of the assets allocated away from the Trading Advisor comprises
of the value of the assets allocated to the Trading Advisor prior to such allocation away from the Trading Advisor. In calculating
New High Net Trading Profits, incentive fees paid for a previous Incentive Measurement Period will not reduce cumulative New High
Net Trading Profits in subsequent periods.  

Brokerage
Commissions and Fees    

The
Registrant indirectly pays to the clearing brokers all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, National Futures
Association (  NFA  ) fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses
charged in connection with the Registrant s trading activities. These activities are charged indirectly through the Registrant s
Affiliated Investment Funds and are reflected within the respective net asset values of each of the Affiliated Investment Funds.
On average, total charges paid to the clearing brokers are expected to be less than $10.00 per round-turn trade, although the
clearing broker s brokerage commissions and trading fees will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The exact amount
of such brokerage commissions and trading fees to be incurred is impossible to estimate and will vary based upon a number of factors
including the trading frequency of each Trading Advisor, the types of instruments traded, transaction sizes, degree of leverage
employed and transaction rates in effect from time to time.

Financial
Information about Segments    

The
Registrant s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes. The Registrant does not engage in the

is set forth under Items 2 and 3 herein.  

Financial
Information about Geographic Areas    

Although
the Registrant has indirect exposure to the global futures, forward and option markets, it does not have operations outside of

Available
Information    

The
Registrant files an annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments
to these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ). You may read and copy any document
filed by the Registrant at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the
SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the Public Reference Room. The Registrant does not maintain an internet website; however,
the Registrant s SEC filings are available to the public from the EDGAR database on the SEC s website at  http://www.sec.gov .

Critical
Accounting Policies   

General    

Preparation
of the condensed financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (  U.S. GAAP  ) requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance.
Applying these policies requires the Managing Member to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation
of the Registrant s condensed financial statements. Actual results may differ from the estimates used.  

The
Managing Member has evaluated the Registrant s condensed financial statements and related disclosures and has determined
that the policies discussed below are critical accounting policies because they involve estimates, judgments and assumptions that
are particularly complex, subjective or uncertain. For further discussion of the Registrant s significant accounting policies,
see Note 2 of the Registrant s 2015 Annual Report, which is filed as an exhibit to the Registrant s Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.   

The
Registrant records all investments at fair value in its condensed financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in
the condensed statements of operations. Generally, fair values are based on quoted market prices; however, in certain circumstances,
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price. The
Registrant considers its investments in publicly-traded mutual funds, to be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets (Level 1). Level 3 inputs reflect the Registrant s assumptions that it believes market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The Registrant develops Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances,
which may include indirect correlation to a market value, combinations of market values or the Registrant s proprietary
data. Level 3 inputs generally include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation of observable market data. The
Registrant does not currently have any investments valued using Level 3 inputs.  

Of
the Registrant s investments at September 30, 2016, $1,499,052 or 28.48% of Net Asset Value were classified as Level 1 and
a majority of the remainder of Net Asset Value was invested in Affiliated Investment Funds. Of the Registrant s investments
at December 31, 2015, $1,296,166 or 17.67% of Net Asset Value were classified as Level 1. There were no Level 2 investments at
December 31, 2015. There were no Level 3 investments at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, nor any portion of the interim
periods. Fair value ordinarily is the value determined for the Affiliated Investment Funds in accordance with the fund s
valuation policies and reported at the time of the Registrant s valuation by the management of the fund. Generally, the
fair value of the Registrant s investment in the Affiliated Investment Funds represents the amount that the Registrant could
reasonably expect to receive from the funds if the Registrant s investment was redeemed at the time of the valuation, based
on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Registrant believes to be reliable.  

25  

        Table of Contents  

The
Registrant invests a portion of the excess cash balances not required for margin through certain investment funds which invest
in (i) U.S. government securities (which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States),
(ii) any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies
of the United States government, (iii) corporate bonds or notes, or (iv) other instruments permitted by applicable rules and regulations
(collectively,   Certain Investment Funds  ). The objective is to obtain a rate of return for the Registrant
that balances risk and return relative to the historically low yields on short term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage
firms. There is no guarantee that the Managing Member will be successful in investing the excess cash successfully to obtain
a greater yield than available on short term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms. The Managing Member is paid monthly
1/12 of 50% of the first 1% of the positive returns earned on the Registrant s investments in Certain Investment Funds.
The calculation is based on the Registrant s average annualized Net Asset Value, and any losses related to returns on the
Certain Investment Funds must first be recovered through subsequent positive returns prior to the Managing Member receiving a
payment. After the calculation of the amount payable to the Managing Member, the Registrant will be credited with all additional
positive returns (or 100% of any losses) on the Registrant s investment in Certain Investment Funds. If at the end of any
calendar year, a loss has been incurred on the returns for the Certain Investment Funds, then the loss carry forward will reset
to zero for the next calendar year with regards to the calculation of the Managing Member s portion of the Certain Investment
Fund s income.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
Registrant commenced operations on January 1, 2007. Contributions were raised and redemptions paid through new Members 
investments in and redemptions out of the aggregate trading vehicle through December 31, 2009. Beginning January 1,
2010, Individual Members may redeem directly from the Registrant on a monthly basis.  

Subscriptions
and Redemptions    

Third
Quarter 2016     

Subscriptions
of interests for the Third Quarter 2016 were $0. Redemptions of interests for the Third Quarter 2016 were $142,815.  

Third
Quarter 2015    

Subscriptions
of interests for the Third Quarter 2015 were $0. Redemptions of interests for the Third Quarter 2015 were $662,698.  

Liquidity    

A
portion of the Registrant s net assets is held in cash, which is used as margin for its indirect trading in commodities
through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds.  

Commodity
contracts exposed to indirectly through the Registrant s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds may be subject to periods
of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, commodity exchanges limit
fluctuations in certain commodity futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily limits .
During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract for a particular
commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the commodity can neither be taken nor
liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved
the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent the Registrant from
promptly liquidating its indirect exposure through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds, to commodity futures positions.  

Since
the Registrant s business is to trade futures, forward and option contracts through its investment in Affiliated Investment
Funds, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties
to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). The Registrant s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number
of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which
the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Registrant s speculative
trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could result in losses considerably beyond the Registrant s
experience to date and could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of Members  capital. The Managing Member
attempts to minimize these risks by requiring the Registrant and the Trading Advisors to abide by various trading limitations
and policies, which include limiting margin amounts, trading only in liquid markets and permitting the use of stop loss provisions.
See Note 10 of the Registrant s 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion on the credit and market risks associated with
the Registrant s futures, forwards and option contracts held indirectly through its investment in Affiliated Investment
Funds.

There
are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to
result in the Registrant s liquidity increasing or decreasing in a material way.  

Capital
Resources    

The
Registrant does not intend to raise additional capital through the sale of interests offered or through any borrowing. Due to
the nature of the Registrant s business, the Registrant does not contemplate making capital expenditures. The Registrant
does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. Redemptions, exchanges, and sales of interests in the future will
affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures interests in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate
the amount, and therefore the impact, of future inflows and outflows of interests. There are no known material trends, favorable
or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Registrant s capital resource arrangements
at the present time.  

Market
Overview   

Following
is a market overview for the Third Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter 2015:  

Third
Quarter 2016     

Third
quarter market drivers included traders  expectations for global central bank activity (particularly divergence as the U.S.
Federal Reserve moves closer towards its next rate hike), the health of the global economy and the continued fallout from the
Brexit vote.  

In
the U.S., equity indices hit new highs as market participants believed that the economy would be strong enough to withstand an
anticipated year-end quarter-point rate hike from the Federal Reserve. While that optimism was tempered by quarter-end, U.S. indices
nevertheless ended September higher. U.S. bond prices took their lead from equity markets and fell (as yields rose) while staying
within well-defined ranges. Conversely, in overseas markets where the expectation was for continued accommodative policy, European
markets such as the German DAX and UK FTSE rose as did bond prices. Similarly, Asian equity markets including the Topix, Nikkei
and Hang Seng also moved higher albeit in Japan, bond prices plunged (and yields soared) when BOJ Governor Kuroda underwhelmed
the market with less aggressive stimulus than what was anticipated; by quarter end prices had moved a bit off the intra-quarter
low.  

In
currency markets, the dollar ended the three-month period slightly lower against a basket of currencies as it vacillated basis
expectations for Fed action; the Fed kept rates unchanged in September thereby increasing the odds for a December hike. The British
pound s freefall on the  leave  vote in June stabilized during the third quarter as the Bank of England unveiled
a strong package of stimulus including the first interest rate cut since 2009. In other markets, the euro ended the quarter slightly
higher while the Japanese yen, slightly lower.  

In
commodity markets, crude oil prices seesawed during the third quarter ultimately ending the period lower. Early on, prices sank
under the weight of elevated inventories, rising rig counts, demand concerns and a strong US dollar. Thereafter, prices moved
off those lows on signs of falling U.S. inventories and reports that OPEC had agreed to reduce production for the first time in
eight years. In precious metals, gold started the quarter on a positive note, rising to a two-year high only to drift lower as
the quarter progressed on expectations for higher U.S. interest rates. Conversely, palladium prices ended the quarter sharply
higher on stronger Chinese car sales amid potential shortfalls in supply.  

In
base metals, markets generally ended the period higher with the outlook for Chinese demand, supply, and the overall health of
the global economy influencing price. In traditional agricultural markets, grain prices ended the quarter lower on record yields;
soybean oil was the exception as diminished palm oil supply stoked strong demand for this substitute vegetable oil. Cocoa prices
similarly ended the quarter lower with market back in surplus while coffee and sugar moved higher on Brazilian weather concerns.
In meats, prices of both hogs and cattle moved south on weaker demand and ample animal supply.  

  .  

    Third
Quarter 2015    

Volatility
took center stage in the third quarter as investors worried about a China slowdown and its ripple effects through the global economy.
In August, a surprise devaluation of the yuan created havoc sending shockwaves across global financial markets. In currencies,
some of the broadest moves were seen in the commodity exporters as slowing China growth translated into diminished physical demand;
the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars in addition to the Brazilian real and Norwegian krone were examples of currencies
that marked multi-year lows. Conversely, the Japanese yen and euro benefited from the uncertainty while unconventionally, the
U.S. dollar, a traditional safe haven, was shunned in August as U.S. rate-hike expectations were deferred.  

27  

        Table of Contents  

This
global uncertainty though brought investors back to global bond markets. Early in the quarter, safe-haven demand sparked by overseas
crises from the Chinese equity meltdown to a break-down in Greek debt negotiations, buoyed prices. Later, prices received an additional
lift as tumbling commodity prices diminished global inflationary expectations and weakening economic growth raised the specter
of further monetary accommodation, notably in Europe and Japan. Finally, the surprise resignation of John Boehner as Speaker of
the House also added uncertainty in the U.S. market. Conversely, global equities moved swiftly lower during Third Quarter 2015
as August s surprise devaluation of the Chinese yuan spooked the indices. The downdraft extended into September on news
of Volkswagen s emission-rigging scandal, the potential demise of Glencore and resurgent worries over global growth.  

The
downward trend in commodity markets continued into Third Quarter 2015. Crude oil started the quarter on a weak note as a global
supply glut combined with diminished demand sent prices to 6  year lows. At month end August though, prices soared 25%
in the final three trading session sparked by OPEC comments indicating a potential willingness to talk about production and a
report showing that US shale producers had begun cutting supplies; prices made little headway thereafter. Conversely, natural
gas prices continued to fall as warmer weather reduced demand. Base metals prices also ended the three month period lower on demand
worries while gold prices vacillated more broadly on changing global inflation expectations. Wheat, corn and soybeans all fell
in the third quarter as harvest progressed smoothly amid expectations for decreasing demand. Coffee, sugar and cocoa prices also
ended the quarter lower.  

Sector
Performance   

Due
to the nature of the Registrant s indirect trading activities, a period-to-period comparison of its indirect trading results
is not meaningful. However, set forth below are the following:  

(a)       the
major sectors to which the Registrant s assets were allocated indirectly as of the Third Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter
2015, measured as a percentage of the   gross speculator margin   (i.e., the minimum amount of cash or marginable
securities a speculator must post when buying or selling futures assets); and  

(b)       a
discussion of the Registrant s trading results for the major sectors in which the Registrant traded indirectly for the Third
Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter 2015.  

Third
Quarter 2016    

As
of September 30, 2016, the allocation of the Registrant s assets, through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds,
to major sectors was as follows:  

Trading
results for the major sectors in which the Registrant traded indirectly for the Third Quarter 2016 were as follows:  

Currencies:
(-)  The Registrant experienced losses in currencies as small gains in July and August were insufficient to cover August losses.
Losses in the euro were the largest as trading was unprofitable in all three months of the quarter. Gains were realized in the
Japanese yen, notably in July as prices rallied on the BOJ policy announcement, and the Mexican peso.  

Interest
Rates: (-)  The Registrant realized losses in global interest rates, notably in August as losses accumulated across all markets
traded in the sector. Overall, the largest losses were seen in the U.S. markets as prices trended lower. Trading in German interest
rates markets was net profitable for the quarter.  

28  

        Table of Contents  

Indices:
(+)  The Registrant experienced gains in global stock indices. Overall, gains in July were sufficient to cover losses in August
and September. The quarter s largest individual market gains were posted in the Nasdaq; the quarter s largest losses
were realized in the Nikkei.  

Energies:
(-)  The Registrant experienced losses in the energy complex as gains in July were offset by losses in August and September.
At quarter end, losses were realized throughout all markets in the complex, particularly WTI crude and Gasoline.  

Metals:
(-)  The Registrant realized losses in metals. In the precious group, trading in gold and silver was unprofitable as prices
were influenced on expectations for U.S. central bank activity. In base metals losses accumulated in copper as prices vacillated
based on expectations for global growth.  

Grains:
(-)  The Registrant realized losses in grains as prices overall declined during the quarter. Largest losses were in soybeans
and wheat. Largest gains were in corn.  

Tropicals:
(-)  The Registrant realized losses due to unprofitable trading in cocoa as the market ended the quarter lower amid whipsaw
price action. Small profits were seen in sugar.  

Meats:
(+)  The Registrant realized gains on positions in cattle as prices ended the quarter lower on ample supply.

to major sectors was as follows:  

Trading
results for the major sectors in which the Registrant traded indirectly for the Third Quarter 2015 were as follows:  

Currencies :
: (-) The Registrant experienced the majority of its losses in August as the Japanese yen and euro rallied sharply on safe haven
buying in the wake of the surprise Chinese devaluation of the yuan. These losses erased July gains on long dollar exposures.  

Energies:
 (+) The Registrant experienced gains in crude oil as prices ended the quarter lower on a global supply glut amid diminished
demand. Gains were also posted in natural gas as prices slid on warm weather in the U.S.  

Grains :
(-) The Registrant realized losses in grains largely due to September price action as grain markets rallied off lows on weather
worries.  

Indices:
 (-) The Registrant experienced losses   notably in U.S. stock indices - as global equity indices slid sharply as worries
over the health of the global economy intensified. The largest losses for the quarter were recorded in August.  

Interest
Rates:  (+) The Registrant experience gains as global bond prices rallied on safe haven buying in the wake of global uncertainty
sparked by a slowing Chinese economy. Further, falling commodity prices dimmed the global inflationary outlook thereby deferring
expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike while increasing speculation for additional European monetary accommodation.  

Meats:
 (+) The Registrant realized gains in meats as cattle prices ended the quarter lower.  

Metals:
 (+) The Registrant realized profits in metals. Overall, the largest gains were realized in the precious group, particularly
silver and platinum.

a fixed rate, calculated as a percentage of the Registrant s New High Net Trading Profits (as defined in the Trading Advisory
Agreements). As such, the Managing Member cannot anticipate the amounts to be paid for future periods as Net Asset Values and
New High Net Trading Profits are not known until a future date.

Commissions
payable to the Registrant s commodity broker are based on a cost per executed trade and, as such, the Managing Member cannot
anticipate the amount that will be required under the brokerage agreement, as the level of executed trades are not known until
a future date. These agreements are effective for one-year terms, renewable automatically for additional one-year terms unless
terminated. Additionally, these agreements may be terminated by either party thereto for various reasons. Additionally, since
the Registrant does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or
other long-term liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Registrant s condensed statements of financial condition,
a table of contractual obligations has not been presented. For a further discussion of the Registrant s contractual obligations,

Item 3.      Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Introduction   

Past
Results Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Performance    

The
Registrant is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes,
and substantially all of the Registrant s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the
risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Registrant s main line of business.  

Market
movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Registrant s open positions and, consequently, in its
earnings and cash flow. The Registrant s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and
volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the
diversification effects among the Registrant s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.  

The
Registrant rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it
is not possible to predict how a particular futures market scenario will affect performance, and the Registrant s past performance
is not necessarily indicative of its future results.  

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures    

The
following qualitative disclosures regarding the Registrant s market risk exposures - except for (i) those disclosures
that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how the Registrant manages its primary market risk exposures
- constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the
Exchange Act.  

The
Registrant s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by the Managing Member and the
Trading Advisors for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks are one of which could
cause the actual results of the Registrant s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies.
Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political
upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other
factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies
of the Registrant. There can be no assurance that the Registrant s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies
will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Members must be prepared
to lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Registrant.  

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure    

The
means by which the Managing Member and the Trading Advisors through CTA Choice attempt to manage the risk of the Registrant s
open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded.  

The
Trading Advisors attempt to minimize market risk exposure by applying their own risk management trading policies that include
the diversification of trading assets into various market sectors. Additionally, the Managing Member s oversight committee
is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the Trading Advisors  trading policies. The oversight committee meets periodically
to discuss and analyze issues such as liquidity, position size, capacity, performance cycles, and new product and market strategies.

        Table of Contents  

The
Managing Member attempts to minimize market risk exposure by requiring the Trading Advisors to abide by various trading limitations
and policies. The Managing Member monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies which include, but are not limited
to, limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined and generally limiting
transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions. Additionally,
the Managing Member shall automatically terminate the Trading Advisors through termination of the CTA Fund if the Net Asset Value
of the Registrant declines by 40% during any year or since the commencement of trading activities. Furthermore, the Trust Agreement
provides that the Registrant will liquidate its positions, and eventually dissolve, if the Registrant experiences a decline in
the Net Asset Value of 50% in any year or since the commencement of trading activities. In each case, the decline in Net Asset
Value is after giving effect for contributions, distributions and redemptions. The Managing Member may impose additional restrictions
(through modifications of such trading limitations and policies) upon the trading activities of the Trading Advisors as it, in
good faith, deems to be in the best interest of the Registrant.  

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The
Registrant s   disclosure controls and procedures   (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant s management, including
the Managing Member s President and Director of Fund Administration (who, in these capacities, function as the Principal
Executive Officers and Principal Financial/Accounting Officer, respectively, of the Registrant), as appropriate to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In
designing and evaluating the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures, the Managing Member recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can prove absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Registrant have been detected.  

The
Managing Member s management, under the supervision and with the participation of certain officers of the Managing Member
(including the Managing Member s President and Director of Fund Administration), has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures during the Year-To-Date 2016. Based upon such evaluation, the Managing Member s
President and Director of Fund Administration have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Registrant s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a   15(f)
and 15d   15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Third Quarter 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.      Legal
Proceedings   

There
are no material legal proceedings pending, on appeal, or concluded to which the Registrant is a party or to which any of its assets
are subject.  

Item 1.A.      Risk
Factors   

There
have been no changes from risk factors as previously disclosed in the Registrant s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015.  

Item 2.      Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016, the Registrant sold interests which resulted in aggregate proceeds to the Registrant of

                                         in this Report any change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting
                                         that occurred during the Registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,

                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         Registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and

                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
