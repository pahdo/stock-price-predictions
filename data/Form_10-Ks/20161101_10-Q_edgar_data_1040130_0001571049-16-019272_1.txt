Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Organization 

PetMed Express, Inc.
and subsidiaries, d/b/a 1-800-PetMeds (the  Company ), is a leading nationwide pet pharmacy. The Company markets prescription
and non-prescription pet medications, health products, and supplies for dogs and cats, direct to the consumer. The Company offers
consumers an attractive alternative for obtaining pet medications in terms of convenience, price, and speed of delivery. The Company
markets its products through national advertising campaigns, which aim to increase the recognition of the  1-800-PetMeds 
brand name, and  PetMeds  family of trademarks, increase traffic on its website at  www.1800petmeds.com , acquire
new customers, and maximize repeat purchases. The majority of the Company s sales are to residents in the United States.
The Company s corporate headquarters and distribution facility are located in Pompano Beach, Florida. In the third quarter
of fiscal 2017, we plan on relocating the corporate headquarters and distribution facility to Delray Beach, Florida. The Company s
fiscal year end is March 31, and references herein to Fiscal 2017 or Fiscal 2016 refer to the Company's fiscal years ending March
31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 

The accompanying unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore,
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company
at September 30, 2016, the Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and
Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and six months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of PetMed Express, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon
consolidation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts of
the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term
nature of these instruments. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

On March 30, 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) released Accounting Standards Update on Stock Compensation Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). The objective of this update is to simplify several aspects of the accounting
for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. 

The Company does not believe
that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, will have a material effect
on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Note 2: Net Income Per Share  

In accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 260 (  Earnings Per Share  ) basic net income per
share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per common share includes the dilutive effect of potential restricted stock and the effects
of the potential conversion of preferred shares, calculated using the treasury stock method. Unvested restricted stock and convertible
preferred shares issued by the Company represent the only dilutive effect reflected in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 

The following is a reconciliation
of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented (in thousands,
except for per share amounts): 

For the three
and six months ended September 30, 2016,  30,000 shares of common restricted stock were excluded from the computations of
diluted net income per common share, as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net income per common
share.  All other common restricted stock was included in the diluted net income per common share
computation for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015.  

Note 3: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company records
compensation expense associated with restricted stock in accordance with ASC Topic 718 (  Share Based Payment  ).
The compensation expense related to all of the Company s stock-based compensation arrangements is recorded as a component
of general and administrative expenses. The Company had 977,879 restricted common shares issued under the 2006 Employee Equity
Compensation Restricted Stock Plan ( 2006 Employee Plan ), 272,000 restricted common shares issued under the 2006 Outside
Director Equity Compensation Restricted Stock Plan ( 2006 Director Plan ), and 30,000 restricted common shares issued
under the 2015 Outside Director Equity Compensation Restricted Stock Plan ( 2015 Director Plan ) at September 30, 2016,
all shares of which were issued subject to a restriction or forfeiture period which lapse ratably on the first, second, and third
anniversaries of the date of grant, and the fair value of which is being amortized over the three-year restriction period. 

In July 2016, the Board
of Directors approved the issuance of 50,000 restricted shares to certain employees of the Company under the 2006 Employee Plan,
with a fair value of $19.60 per share. In July 2016, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 30,000 restricted shares to
directors of the Company under the 2015 Director Plan, with a fair value of $20.73 per share. For the quarters ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $483,000 and $406,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to the Employee
and Director Plans. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $946,000 and $777,000, respectively,
of compensation expense related to the Employee and Director Plans. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was $4.3 million and
$2.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the non-vested restricted stock awards, respectively, which is expected
to be recognized over the next three years. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were 273,000 and 186,000 non-vested restricted
shares, respectively. 

On July 29, 2016, the
Company s 2016 Employee Equity Compensation Restricted Stock Plan ( 2016 Employee Plan) became effective upon the approval
of the plan by the Company s Shareholders. The 2016 Employee Plan authorizes 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common stock
available for issuance under the plan. 

Note 4: Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment
are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The buildings
located at 420 South Congress Avenue, Delray Beach, Florida, the Company s new corporate headquarters and distribution facility
( the Property ) (described below) will be depreciated over a period of thirty years. The furniture, fixtures, equipment,
and computer software are depreciated over periods ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital
lease agreements are amortized over the shorter of the underlying lease agreement or the useful life of the asset. 

On December 22, 2015,
the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of the Property at a purchase price of $18.5 million, plus closing costs.
The transaction closed on January 19, 2016. The Property consists of approximately 634,000 square feet of land or 14.6 acres with
two building complexes totaling approximately 185,000 square feet, with additional land for future use. Once the Property is renovated
to the Company s specifications and ready for its operation, expected in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company intends
to occupy approximately 97,000 square feet for its corporate headquarters and distribution facility, and to continue to operate
the remaining office and warehouse space pursuant to existing leases. At September 30, 2016, the Company paid approximately $5.8
million for building improvements and equipment related to the newly purchased Property, which was recorded as a prepaid current
asset, since the Property will not be ready to be put into use until the quarter ending December 31, 2016. 

Note 5: Fair Value  

The Company
carries various assets and liabilities at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is defined as an
exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. ASC Topic 820 ( Fair Value Measurements ) establishes
a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: 

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

 Level 2 - Include other inputs that are
directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 

 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs which are
supported by little or no market activity. 

The fair value hierarchy
also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. At September 30, 2016, the Company had invested the majority of its $51.9 million cash and cash equivalents balance in money
market funds which are classified within level 1. 

Note 6: Commitments and Contingencies  

The Company has settled
complaints that had been filed with various states  regulatory boards in the past. There can be no assurances made that other
states will not attempt to take similar actions against the Company in the future. The Company initiates litigation to protect
its trade or service marks. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in protecting its trade or service marks.
Legal costs related to the above matters are expensed as incurred. 

Note 7: Changes in Shareholders  Equity
and Comprehensive Income:  

Changes in shareholders 
equity for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are summarized below (in thousands): 

No shares of treasury
stock were purchased or retired in the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note 8: Income Taxes  

For the quarters
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $2.9 million and $2.6 million,
respectively, and for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately
$6.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The increase to the income tax provision for the three and six months ended September
30, 2016, is related to increased operating income. The effective tax rate for each of the quarter and six months ended September
30, 2016 was approximately 37.1%, compared to 37.0% for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2015. 

Note 9: Subsequent Events  

On October 24, 2016 our
Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. The Board established a November 7, 2016 record date and a
November 18, 2016 payment date. Based on the outstanding share balance as of November 1, 2016 the Company estimates the dividend
payable to be approximately $3.9 million. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Executive Summary  

PetMed Express was incorporated
in the state of Florida in January 1996. The Company s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the
symbol  PETS.  The Company began selling pet medications and other pet health products in September 1996. In March
2010, the Company started offering for sale additional pet supplies on its website, and these items are drop shipped to customers
by third party vendors. Presently, the Company s product line includes approximately 3,000 of the most popular pet medications,
health products, and supplies for dogs and cats. 

The Company markets its
products through national advertising campaigns which aim to increase the recognition of the  1-800-PetMeds  brand
name, and  PetMeds  family of trademarks, increase traffic on its website at  www.1800petmeds.com , acquire new
customers, and maximize repeat purchases. Approximately 82% of all sales were generated via the Internet for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, compared to 81% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The Company s sales consist of products sold
mainly to retail consumers. The three-month average purchase was approximately $82 and $80 per order for the quarters ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the six-month average purchase was approximately $82 and $81 per order for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and
the data used to prepare them. The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an ongoing basis we re-evaluate our judgments
and estimates including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments
on our historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available
information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our estimates are guided
by observing the following critical accounting policies. 

Revenue recognition 

The Company generates
revenue by selling pet medication products and pet supplies primarily to retail consumers. The Company s policy is to recognize
revenue from product sales upon shipment, when the rights of ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Outbound shipping
and handling fees are included in sales and are billed upon shipment. Shipping expenses are included in cost of sales. The majority
of the Company s sales are paid by credit cards and the Company usually receives the cash settlement in two to three banking
days. Credit card sales minimize accounts receivable balances relative to sales. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for losses that the Company estimates will arise from customers  inability to make required payments, arising from
either credit card charge-backs or insufficient funds checks. The Company determines its estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts
receivable by analyzing historical bad debts and current economic trends. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately
$10,000 at September 30, 2016 compared to $13,000 at March 31, 2016. 

Valuation of inventory 

Inventories consist of
prescription and non-prescription pet medications and pet supplies that are available for sale and are priced at the lower of cost
or market value using a weighted average cost method. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence. The inventory
reserve was approximately $37,000 at September 30, 2016 compared to $64,000 at March 31, 2016. 

Advertising 

The Company's advertising
expense consists primarily of Internet marketing and direct mail/print advertising. Internet costs are expensed in the month incurred
and direct mail/print advertising costs are expensed when the related catalogs, brochures, and postcards are produced, distributed,
or superseded. 

Accounting for income taxes 

The Company accounts for
income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740 (  Accounting for Income Taxes  ), which generally requires
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax benefits or consequences of events that have been
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between the financial reporting carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured
by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse. 

Results of Operations  

The following should be
read in conjunction with the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included
elsewhere herein. The following table sets forth, as a percentage of sales, certain operating data appearing in the Company s
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015, and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Six Months Ended September 30,
2015  

Sales   

Sales
increased by approximately $4.1 million, or 7.2%, to approximately $60.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from
approximately $56.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, sales increased
by approximately $4.9 million, or 3.8%, to approximately $133.3 million compared to $128.4 million for the six months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to increased new order
and reorder sales. The Company acquired approximately 131,000 new customers for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared
to approximately 127,000 new customers for the same period the prior year. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 the Company
acquired approximately 289,000 new customers, compared to 275,000 new customers for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The
following chart illustrates sales by various sales classifications:  

Going forward sales may
be adversely affected due to increased competition and consumers giving more consideration to price. No guarantees can be made
that sales will grow in the future. The majority of our product sales are affected by the seasons, due to the seasonality of mainly
heartworm, and flea and tick medications. For the quarters ended June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 of Fiscal 2016,
the Company s sales were approximately 30%, 24%, 22%, and 24%, respectively. 

Cost of sales   

Cost of sales increased
by approximately $4.9 million, or 13%, to approximately $42.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from approximately
$37.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales increased by
approximately $6.3 million, or 7.3%, to approximately $92.8 million compared to $86.5 million for the same period in the prior
year. The increase in cost of sales is directly related to the increase in sales during the quarter and six months ended September
30, 2016. Cost of sales as a percent of sales was 70.3% and 66.7% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the cost of sales was 69.6% and 67.4%, respectively. The increase to cost
of sales as a percentage of sales for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2016 is mainly attributed to an increase in
product costs on certain brands and additional discounts given to customers to increase sales during the quarter and six months. 

Gross profit   

Gross
profit decreased by approximately $849,000, or 4.5%, to approximately $18.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from
approximately $18.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 gross profit
decreased by approximately $1.4 million, or 3.3%, to approximately $40.5 million, compared to $41.9 million for the same period
in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit  is directly related to an increase in product costs on certain brands and
additional discounts given to customers to increase sales during the quarter and six months.  Gross
profit as a percentage of sales was 29.7% and 33.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,  and
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gross profit was 30.4% and 32.6%, respectively. The gross profit percentage
decrease for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2016 is mainly attributed to an increase in product costs on certain
brands and additional discounts given to customers to increase sales during the quarter and six months. 

General and administrative expenses   

General
and administrative expenses increased by approximately $359,000, or 6.7%, to approximately $5.7 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, from approximately $5.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative
expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the following: a $258,000 increase in payroll expenses;
a $95,000 increase in bank service fees; a $59,000 increase in bad debt expenses relating to increased credit card chargebacks
during the quarter; and a $10,000 net increase in other expenses which included telephone expenses, licenses, professional fees,
and travel expenses. Offsetting the increase was a $34,000 decrease to property expenses relating to computer maintenance and a
$29,000 decrease to insurance expenses. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $658,000, or 5.9%, to approximately
$11.8 million from approximately $11.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the following: a $546,000 increase in payroll expenses;
a $129,000 increase in bank service fees; and a $124,000 increase in bad debt expenses relating to increased credit card chargebacks
during the quarter. Offsetting the increase was a $75,000 decrease to property expenses relating to computer maintenance; a $63,000
decrease to insurance expenses; and a $3,000 net decrease in other expenses which included telephone expenses, licenses, professional
fees, office expenses, and travel expenses. 

Advertising expenses   

Advertising expenses decreased
by approximately $1.8 million, or 30%, to approximately $4.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from approximately
$6.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, advertising expenses decreased
by approximately $4.0 million, or 28%, to approximately $10.1 million compared to advertising expenses of approximately $14.1 million
for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in advertising expenses for the three and six months ended September
30, 2016 is mainly attributed to the elimination of television advertising spending. The advertising costs of acquiring a new customer,
defined as total advertising costs divided by new customers acquired, decreased to $33 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the advertising
costs of acquiring a new customer were $35 and $51, respectively. The decrease in customer acquisition costs for the quarter and
six months ended September 30, 2016 is attributed to increased sales conversion. Advertising cost of acquiring a new customer can
be impacted by the advertising environment, the effectiveness of our advertising creative, advertising spending, and price competition.
Historically, the advertising environment fluctuates due to supply and demand. A more favorable advertising environment may positively
impact future new order sales, whereas a less favorable advertising environment may negatively impact future new order sales. 

As a percentage of sales,
advertising expense was 7.2% and 11.0% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 advertising expense was 7.6% and 11.0%, respectively. The decrease in advertising expense as
a percentage of total sales for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2016 is attributed to an elimination of television
advertising spending. The Company currently anticipates advertising as a percentage of sales to be approximately 7.0% for Fiscal
2017. However, the advertising percentage will fluctuate quarter to quarter due to seasonality and advertising availability. For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, quarterly advertising expenses as a percentage of sales ranged between 7% and 11%. 

Depreciation   

Depreciation expense increased
by approximately $18,000 to approximately $204,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $186,000 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 depreciation expense increased by approximately $21,000
to $398,000 compared to $377,000 for the same period in the prior year. The increase to depreciation expense for the quarter and
six months ended September 30, 2016 can be attributed to an increase in new property and equipment additions. 

Other income   

Other income increased
by approximately $4,000 to approximately $55,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $51,000 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 other income increased by approximately $39,000 to approximately
$136,000 compared to approximately $97,000 for the same period in the prior year. The increase to other income for the quarter
and six months ended September 30, 2016 is related to rental revenue offset by decreased interest income. Interest income may decrease
in the future as the Company utilizes its cash balances on its share repurchase plan, with approximately $10.2 million remaining
as of September 30, 2016, on any quarterly dividend payment, or on its operating activities. 

Provision for income taxes   

For the quarters ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively,
and for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $6.8 million
and $6.0 million, respectively. The increase to the income tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016,
is related to an increase in operating income. The effective tax rate for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately 37.1%, compared to 37.0% for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2015. The Company estimates its effective
tax rate will be approximately 37.0% for Fiscal 2017. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company s working
capital at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 was $66.0 million and $60.5 million, respectively. The $5.5 million increase in
working capital was primarily attributable to cash flow generated from operations, offset by dividends paid. Net cash provided
by operating activities was $27.8 million and $14.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
This change can be mainly attributed to a decrease in the Company s inventory balance, compared to the same period in the
prior year. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $5.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to net cash used in investing activities of $208,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. This change in investing activities
is related to increased property and equipment additions related to the Company s new corporate headquarters and distribution
facility in Delray Beach, Florida. Net cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the six months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $7.3 million for the same period in the prior year, which represented an increase in the dividend paid in the
period ended September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016,
the Company had approximately $10.2 million remaining under the Company s share repurchase plan. Subsequent to September
30, 2016, on October 24, 2016 our Board of Directors declared a $0.19 per share dividend. The Board established a November 7, 2016
record date and a November 18, 2016 payment date. Depending on future market conditions the Company may utilize its cash and cash
equivalents on the remaining balance of its current share repurchase plan, on dividends, or on its operating activities. At September
30, 2016 the Company had no outstanding lease commitments except for the lease for its 65,300 square foot facility in Pompano Beach,
Florida. We are not currently bound by any long or short term agreements for the purchase or lease of capital expenditures. Any
material amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide
for any increase in our business. To date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working
capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future. Presently, we have approximately $4.0 million forecasted for capital
expenditures for the remainder of Fiscal 2017, which will be funded through cash from operations. The Company s primary source
of working capital is cash from operations. The Company presently has no need for alternative sources of working capital, and has
no commitments or plans to obtain additional capital. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company had no off-balance
sheet arrangements at September 30, 2016.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

Market risk generally
represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable. The book values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are considered to be representative
of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments.
At September 30, 2016, we had $51.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments
generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates. A significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of
interest income generated from our excess cash and investments. It would also impact the market value of our investments. Our investments
are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. Our investments are managed by a limited number of outside
professional managers within investment guidelines set by our Board of Directors. Such guidelines include security type, credit
quality, and maturity, and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high-quality debt instruments with
both short and long term maturities. We do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market
risk. At September 30, 2016, we had no debt obligations. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

The Company s management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation
Date ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective such that the information relating to our Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act: (1) is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 10.13 

EXHIBIT A  

PETMED EXPRESS, INC. 

 2016 EMPLOYEE EQUITY COMPENSATION 

 RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN 

1. PURPOSE OF PLAN 

The purpose of the PetMed
Express, Inc. 2016 Restricted Stock Plan (the  2016 Plan ), which is being established by PetMed Express, Inc. on behalf
of itself, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the  Company ), is to secure and retain employees of outstanding
ability and to provide additional motivation to such employees to exert their best efforts on behalf of the Company. The Company
expects that it will benefit from the added commitment which such employees will have in the welfare of the Company as a result
of their ownership or increased ownership of the Company's Common Stock. 

2. STOCK SUBJECT TO THE 2016 PLAN 

The shares that may be
awarded under the 2016 Plan (without payment by participants) shall be the common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company
( Common Stock ), and shall be authorized, but un-issued, shares. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that
may be awarded hereunder (subject to any adjustments as provided below) shall not in the aggregate exceed 1,000,000 shares. Shares
of Common Stock forfeited as a result of a participant's termination of employment shall again become available for award under
the 2016 Plan. 

3. ADMINISTRATION 

The 2016 Plan shall be
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, each of whom is a  non-employee director  as defined
in Rule 16b-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Committee ).
No member of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the 2016 Plan. 

The Committee shall have
the sole authority to (i) award shares of Common Stock ( Restricted Stock ) under the 2016 Plan; (ii) consistent with
the 2016 Plan, determine the provisions of the shares to be awarded, the restrictions and other terms and conditions applicable
to each award of shares under the 2016 Plan; (iii) interpret the 2016 Plan, the instruments evidencing the restrictions imposed
upon stock awarded under the 2016 Plan and the shares awarded under the 2016 Plan; (iv) adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations
for the administration of the 2016 Plan; and (v) generally administer the 2016 Plan and make all determinations in connection therewith
which may be necessary or advisable, and all such actions of the Committee shall be binding upon all participants. Committee decisions
and selections shall be made by a majority of its members present at the meeting at which a quorum is present, and shall be final.
Any decision or selection reduced to writing and signed by all of the members of the Committee shall be as fully effective as if
it had been made at a meeting duly held. 

4. ELIGIBILITY 

All employees, including
officers, of the Company who are, from time to time, responsible for the management, growth and protection of the business of the
Company shall be eligible for awards of stock under the 2016 Plan. No member of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
eligible to participate in the 2016 Plan unless such director is also an employee of the Company. The employees who shall receive
awards under the 2016 Plan shall be selected from time to time by the Committee in its sole discretion, from among those eligible,
and the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the number of shares to be awarded to each such employee selected. The
Committee may, within the terms of the 2016 Plan, be selective and non-uniform with respect to its determination of the amount
of awards and the eligible employees to whom such awards are made. 

5. RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO SHARES 

A participant to whom
an award of Restricted Stock has been made under the 2016 Plan will have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the
shares of Common Stock so awarded, including, but not limited to, the right to receive, subject to the following sentence, such
cash dividends, if any, as may be declared on such shares from time to time and the right to vote (in person or by proxy) such
shares at any meeting of the Company s stockholders. As a condition to the grant of the award under the 2016 Plan, and without
limiting the provisions of Section 7(b) hereof, dividends, if any, as may be declared on such shares of Common Stock shall be deposited
into an escrow or similarly segregated account, and disbursement of such dividends to the participant will occur only upon the
delivery of the shares of Common Stock to which such dividends relate, and in the event the shares of Common Stock to which such
dividends relate are forfeited, the participant s right to receive disbursement of such dividends will be forfeited and the
amount of the dividends shall be returned to the Company. 

6. INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION 

If the shares of Common
Stock that have been awarded to an employee pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Plan are not registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, pursuant to an exemption from registration, such employee, if the Committee shall deem it advisable, may be
required to represent and agree in writing (i) that any shares of Common Stock acquired by such employee pursuant to the 2016 Plan
will not be sold except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant
to an exemption from registration under such Act, and (ii) that such employee has acquired such shares of Common Stock for the
participant s own account and not with a view to the distribution thereof. 

7. RESTRICTIONS 

(a) Terms, Conditions and Restrictions. In
addition to such other terms, conditions and restrictions as may be imposed by the Committee and contained in the instrument under
which awards of Common Stock are made pursuant to the 2016 Plan, (i) no Common Stock so awarded shall be restricted for a period
(the  Restriction Period ) of less than one year or more than ten years unless otherwise specified by the Committee;
and (ii) except as provided in paragraph (e) below, the recipient of the award shall remain in the employ of the Company during
the Restriction Period or otherwise forfeit all right, title and interest in and to the shares subject to such restrictions. 

(b) Transferability Restriction. No share awarded
under the 2016 Plan shall be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of during the Restriction
Period applicable thereto. 

(c) Agreements; Stock Legend. As a condition
to the grant of an award under the 2016 Plan, each eligible employee selected to participate shall execute and deliver to the Company
an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee reflecting the conditions and restrictions imposed upon the Common
Stock awarded. Certificates for shares of Common Stock delivered pursuant to such awards may, if the Committee so determines, bear
a legend referring to the restrictions and the instruments to which such awards are subject. 

(d) Additional Conditions. In the agreements
evidencing awards or otherwise, the Committee may impose such other and additional terms, conditions and restrictions upon the
award as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate including, without limitation, that the Company shall have the right to deduct
from payments of any kind due to the participant, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld
with respect to the shares awarded. 

(e) Lapse of Restrictions. The restrictions
imposed under paragraph (a) above shall terminate with respect to the shares of Common Stock to which they apply on the earliest
to occur of the following, unless otherwise specified by the Committee: 

(i)  the expiration of the Restriction Period; 

(ii)  the participant's total and permanent disability;
or 

(iii)  the participant's death. 

Certificates for shares of Common Stock with
respect to which restrictions have lapsed as provided above shall, upon lapse thereof, be released from escrow and delivered to
the participant or, in the event of participant's death, to participant's personal representative. Any stock legend referring to
the restrictions imposed hereunder shall thereupon be removed. 

(f) Change of Control of the Company. Upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the rules and regulations
of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges, or unless the Committee shall determine otherwise, any
Restriction Period and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock shall terminate. 

For purposes of the 2016 Plan, a  Change
in Control  of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred if: 

(a) any person, as such
term is used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, becomes a beneficial owner (within
the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under such Act) of 20% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock; 

(b) there occurs within
any period of two consecutive years any change in the directors of the Company such that the members of the Company's Board of
Directors prior to such change do not constitute a majority of the directors after giving effect to all changes during such two-year
period unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, of each new director was approved by
a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period; or 

(c) the Company is merged,
consolidated or reorganized into or with, or sells all or substantially all of its assets to, another company or other entity,
and immediately after such transaction less than 80% of the voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such company or
other entity immediately after such transaction is held in the aggregate by holders of the Company's Common Stock immediately before
such transaction. 

In addition, if the Company
enters into an agreement or series of agreements or the Board of Directors of the Company adopts a resolution which results in
the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, and the employment of a participant is terminated after and as the sole result of
the entering into of such agreement or series of agreements or the adoption of such resolution then, upon the occurrence of any
of the events described above, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have retroactively occurred on the date of entering into
of the earliest of such agreements or the adoption of such resolution and the participants shall be entitled to the delivery as
of such date of any forfeited Restricted Stock. 

8. MISCELLANEOUS 

(a) No Right to Receive Award. Nothing in the
2016 Plan shall be construed to give any employee of the Company any right to receive an award under the 2016 Plan. 

(b) Additional Shares Received With Respect
to Restricted Stock. Any shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company received by an employee as a stock dividend
on, or as a result of stock splits, combinations, exchanges of shares, reorganizations, mergers, consolidations or otherwise with
respect to shares of Common Stock received pursuant to an award hereunder shall have the same status, be subject to the same restrictions
and bear the same legend, if any, as the shares received pursuant to the original award. 

(c) Certificates for Shares .  Shares
of Restricted Stock granted under the 2016 Plan shall be evidenced by certificates. Certificates representing the Restricted Stock
shall be registered in the name of the participant, such certificates shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms,
conditions, and restrictions applicable to such shares and the Company shall retain physical possession of the certificate in escrow
until all restrictions have been lifted or requirements met. 

(d) No Effect on Employment Rights. Nothing
in the 2016 Plan or in the instruments evidencing the grant of an award hereunder shall in any manner be construed to limit in
any way the right of the Company or a subsidiary to terminate an employee's employment at any time, or give any right to an employee
to remain employed by the Company. 

(e) Governing Law. All provisions of the 2016
Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Florida except to the extent preempted by federal law. 

(f) No Restriction on Corporate Action. Nothing
contained in the 2016 Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company or any subsidiary from taking any corporate action that is
deemed by the Company or such subsidiary to be appropriate or in the best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse
effect on the 2016 Plan or any shares of Common Stock granted under the 2016 Plan. No employee, non-employee director, beneficiary
or other person shall have any claim against the Company or any subsidiary as a result of any such action. 

9. EFFECTIVE DATE OF 2016 PLAN 

The 2016 Plan shall become
effective when approved by the Shareholders of the Company. 

10. AMENDMENTS 

The Committee may amend
or terminate the 2016 Plan without shareholder approval unless shareholder approval is required by any federal or state law or
regulation or the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Committee shall not have the right to amend the 2016 Plan to: 

(i)  except as provided in paragraph 8(b) of the 2016 Plan,
increase the maximum number of shares reserved for purposes of the 2016 Plan; 

(iii)  materially increase the benefits accruing to participants
under the 2016 Plan. 

Any amendment or alteration
which impairs the rights of any participant during the Restriction Period is not effective unless written consent from the participant
is obtained. 

11. DURATION AND TERMINATION 

This 2016 Plan shall terminate,
and no further stock shall be awarded hereunder, after July 29, 2026. In addition, the Committee may terminate the 2016 Plan at
any time prior thereto. The termination of this 2016 Plan shall not, however, affect any restriction previously imposed or restricted
stock awarded pursuant to this 2016 Plan. 

12. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(B) 

The 2016 Plan is intended
to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. All transactions involving the Company's executive officers are subject to such conditions, regardless of whether
the conditions are expressly set forth in the 2016 Plan. Any provision of the 2016 Plan that is contrary to a condition of Rule
16b-3 shall not apply to executive officers of the Company.

WHEREAS, the Compensation
Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting on __________ authorized and directed
the Company to make an award of stock to the Participant under the 2016 Plan for the purposes expressed in the 2016 Plan; 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration
of the foregoing and the mutual undertakings herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 

1. Grant of Stock. In accordance with the terms
of the 2016 Plan and subject to the further terms, conditions and restrictions contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby
grants to the Participant ______ shares (the  Shares ) of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share (the
 Common Stock ). As long as the Shares are subject to the Restrictions set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement, such
shares shall be deemed to be, and are referred to in this Agreement as, the  Restricted Shares.  

2. Certificates for Shares. Certificates evidencing
Restricted Stock shall be deposited with the Company to be held in escrow until such Shares are released to the Participant or
forfeited in accordance with this Agreement. The Participant shall, simultaneously with the delivery of this Agreement, deliver
to the Company a stock power, in blank, executed by the Participant. If any Restricted Stock is forfeited, the Company shall direct
the transfer agent of the Common Stock to make the appropriate entries in its records showing the cancellation of the certificate
or certificates for such Restricted Stock and to return the Shares represented thereby to the Company's treasury. 

3. Adjustments in Restricted Stock. In the
event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Committee shall make equitable adjustments in the Restricted Stock corresponding
to adjustments made by the Committee in the number and class of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the 2016 Plan.
Any new, additional or different securities to which the Participant shall be entitled in respect of Restricted Stock by reason
of such adjustment shall be deemed to be Restricted Stock and shall be subject to the same terms, conditions, and restrictions
as the Restricted Stock so adjusted. 

4. Restrictions. During applicable periods
of restriction determined in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement, Restricted Stock and all rights with respect to such
Stock, may not be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or disposed of and shall
be subject to the risk of forfeiture contained in Section 5 of this Agreement (such limitations on transferability and risk of
forfeiture being herein referred to as  Restrictions ), but the Participant shall have all other rights of a stockholder,
including, but not limited to, the right to vote and receive dividends on Restricted Stock, subject to any dividend to be held
in escrow pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Plan. 

5. Forfeiture of Restricted Stock. In the event
that the Participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason other than his or her death or permanent disability,
such event shall constitute an  Event of Forfeiture  and all Shares which at that time are Restricted Stock shall thereupon
be forfeited by the Participant to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Participant
nor any successor, heir, assign or personal representative of the Participant shall have any right, title or interest in or to
such Restricted Stock or the certificates evidencing them. 

6. Lapse of Restrictions. (a) Except as provided
in subsection (b) below, the Restrictions on the Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement shall lapse ratably on each of the
anniversaries of the date of this Agreement in accordance with the following schedule: 

[INSERT TABLE] 

(b) In the event that a Participant's employment
with the Company terminates as a result of his or her death or permanent disability, the Restrictions shall lapse on the Restricted
Stock (if not already lapsed pursuant to subsection (a) above) on the date of such event. 

Upon lapse of the Restrictions in accordance
with this Section, the Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, deliver to the Participant, or to the Participant's personal
representative, an unrestricted certificate for the Shares with respect to which such Restrictions have lapsed. 

(c) In the event of a change in control, as
defined in the 2016 Plan, any Restriction Period and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock shall lapse. 

7. Withholding Requirements. The Company shall
have the right to withhold from sums due to the Participant, or to require the Participant to remit to the Company in an amount
sufficient to satisfy any Federal, state or local withholding tax requirements prior to making such payments or delivering any
certificate evidencing such Shares. 

8. Effect of Employment. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant the right to continue in the employment of the Company or affect any right
which the Company may have to terminate the employment of the Participant. 

9. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended
except with the consent of the Committee and by a written instrument duly executed by the Participant and the Company. 

10. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.
Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the 2016 Plan, which is annexed hereto, represents that he or she is familiar with
the terms and provisions thereof and accepts the award of Shares hereunder subject to all of the terms and conditions thereof and
of this Agreement. Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations of the
Committee upon any questions arising under the 2016 Plan or this Agreement. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
Company and the Participant have each executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first above written.
