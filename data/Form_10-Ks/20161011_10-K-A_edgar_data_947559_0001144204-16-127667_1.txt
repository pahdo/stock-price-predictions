THE FIRST BANCSHARES, INC.  

EXPLANATORY NOTE  

We are filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A to amend our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on March 30, 2016 (the  Original Form 10-K ). The Original Form 10-K was prepared and filed in accordance with requirements
applicable to  smaller reporting companies  as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ).
During the 3rd quarter of 2016, after consultation with outside counsel, the Company determined that the Company had become, as
of January 1, 2016, an  accelerated filer  as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 due to a re-evaluation of the affiliate
status of certain shareholders, who were initially mistakenly believed to be affiliates of the Company. This increased the Company s
public float to more than $75 million as of June 30, 2015. 

Accordingly, we are amending the Original Form 10-K so that
it complies with all applicable requirements for an  accelerated filer.  Specifically, this amendment is being filed
to (i) correct the Company s public float calculation and filer status set forth on the facing page, (ii) revise and reconfirm
the conclusions of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer regarding the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures required by Item 307 of Regulation S-K, (iii) restate and revise the
Company s Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting required by Item 308(a) of Regulation
S-K and (iv) attach the related attestation report of the registered public accounting firm required by Item 308(b) ( Attestation
Report ) which Attestation Report was not included in the Original Form 10-K on the belief that the Company continued to
be a smaller reporting company. In addition, as required by Rule 12b-15 of the Exchange Act, new certifications by the Company s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer are filed as exhibits to this Amendment No. 1. This Amendment No. 1
also serves to update the exhibit description and index in connection therewith and the signature page to reflect the filing date
of this Amendment No. 1. 

This Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the date
of the Original Form 10-K or modify or update any disclosures that may have been affected by subsequent events. Other than the
changes referred to above, all other information in the Original Form 10-K remains unchanged. 

PART II  

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, have concluded, based upon their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13(a) 15(e)) as of December 31, 2015, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, no changes have occurred in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over
financial reporting. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC. As noted in the Explanatory Note above, the failure to file the Original Form 10-K within the specified time
period for  accelerated filers  as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 resulted from a misinterpretation
of the affiliate status of certain shareholders, and not due to any failure of disclosure controls and procedures. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management of the Company has
concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 Rules 12a-15(f), as of December 31, 2015. 

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute
assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human
failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because
of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal
control over financial reporting. These inherent limitations, however, are known features of the financial reporting process. It
is possible, therefore, to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

T.E. Lott   Company, an independent registered public accounting
firm, which audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation
report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, which is included herein. 

Changes in Internal Control  

There were no significant changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting or in other factors in the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 The First Bancshares, Inc. 

 Hattiesburg, Mississippi 

We have audited The First Bancshares, Inc. s (the Company)
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in  Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, The First Bancshares, Inc., maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of The First Bancshares, Inc.,
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated
March 30, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
