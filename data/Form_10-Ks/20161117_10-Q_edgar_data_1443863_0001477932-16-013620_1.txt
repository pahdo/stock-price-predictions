      Table of Contents           BIOCORRX, INC.     NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       NOTE 1   BUSINESS      BioCorRx Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary Fresh Start Private, Inc., distributes and licenses the BioCorRx Recovery Program for alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment that empowers patients to succeed in their overall recovery. We offer a unique treatment philosophy that combines medical intervention and a counseling/coaching program that is administered by specialized life coaches/counselors.      On January 7, 2014, the Company changed its name from Fresh Start Private Management, Inc. to BioCorRx Inc. In addition, effective February 20, 2014, the Company's quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from CEYY to BICX.       NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Interim Financial Statements      The following (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and (b) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 14, 2016.       Basis of Presentation:      On July 28, 2016, the Company formed BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary and Nevada Corporation, for the purpose of developing certain business lines. As of September 30, 2016, there were no significant assets or liabilities in BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or operations since its formation.     The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BioCorRx Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Fresh Start Private, Inc. and BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the "Company" or "BioCorRx"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.       Revenue Recognition       The Company generates revenue from services and product sales. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ("ASC 605-10") which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the services delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the services has not been performed or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the services has been performed or no refund will be required.                   7       
      Table of Contents           BIOCORRX, INC.    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)      The Company licenses proprietary products and protocols to customers under licensing agreements that allow those customers to utilize the products and protocols in services they provide to their customers. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from license agreements depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each agreement. Such agreements are reviewed for multiple elements. Multiple elements can include amounts related to initial non-refundable license fees for the use of the Company's products and protocols and additional royalties on covered services.      Revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met: (1) written agreements have been executed; (2) delivery of products or intellectual property rights has occurred; (3) fees are fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability of fees is reasonably assured.      Under these license agreements, the Company receives an initial non-refundable license fee and in some cases, additional running royalties. Generally, the Company defers recognition of non-refundable upfront fees if it has continuing performance obligations without which the right, product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the licensee that is separate and independent of its performance under the other elements of the arrangement. License fees collected from Licensees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as income earned over the expected economic life of the related contract.       Use of Estimates      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation, derivative and warrant liabilities, the fair value of other equity and debt instruments and allowance for doubtful accounts.       Concentrations of Credit Risk      Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with credit quality institutions. At times, such amounts may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, deposits in excess of FDIC limits were $80,625 and $-0-, respectively.      Accounts Receivable      Accounts receivable are recorded at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing balances. Management estimates the allowance based on collectability of accounts receivable and prior bad debt experience. Accounts receivable balances are written off upon management's determination that such accounts are uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. Management believes that credit risks on accounts receivable will not be material to the financial position of the Company or results of operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $53,250 and $44,500 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.                   8       
      Table of Contents           BIOCORRX, INC.    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, stock based compensation and notes payable. The fair value of the Company's convertible securities is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value.     See Footnote 9 and 11 for derivative liabilities and Footnote 12 and 13 for stock based compensation and other equity instruments.      Restricted Cash      The Company is required to maintain in its bank accounts at all times no less than 10% of the outstanding principle of its convertible debt issued June 10, 2016. The amount held may be reduced upon noteholder approval. The Cash held must be unrestricted and not subject to any liens. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's restricted cash balance of $250,000 was classified as other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.       Long-Lived Assets      The Company follows FASB ASC 360-10-15-3, "Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets," which established a "primary asset" approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long-lived asset to be held and used. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.       Net Income (loss) Per Share      The Company accounts for net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ("ASC 260-10"), which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the statement of operations for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS.     Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. It excludes the dilutive effects of any potentially issuable common shares.     Diluted net loss share is calculated by including any potentially dilutive share issuances in the denominator. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, potentially dilutive shares issuances were comprised of convertible notes, warrants and stock options.                   9       
      Table of Contents           BIOCORRX, INC.    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)      The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations of weighted average shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, as they would be anti-dilutive:            Advertising      The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. The Company charged to operations $60,034 and $198,778 as advertising costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,825 and $54,202 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.       Derivative Instrument Liability      The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding convertible notes and warrants that contained embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives include certain conversion features and reset provisions. (See Note 9 and Note 11).      Stock Based Compensation      Share-based compensation issued to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The Company measures the fair value of the share-based compensation issued to non-employees using the stock price observed in the arms-length private placement transaction nearest the measurement date (for stock transactions) or the fair value of the award (for non-stock transactions), which were considered to be more reliably determinable measures of fair value than the value of the services being rendered. The measurement date is the earlier of (1) the date at which commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.     As of September 30, 2016, there were 47,850,000 stock options outstanding, of which 18,975,000 were vested and exercisable, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, there were 13,850,000 stock options outstanding with all vested and exercisable, respectively.             BIOCORRX, INC.    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       Income Taxes      Income tax provisions or benefits for interim periods are computed based on the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate. Based on the Company's historical losses and its expectation of continuation of losses for the foreseeable future, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance. As the Company anticipates or anticipated that its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 would be fully offset by a valuation allowance, there is no federal or state income tax benefit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 related to losses incurred during such periods.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements      There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT'S LIQUIDITY PLANS      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $80,625 and working capital deficit of $1,584,783. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used net cash in operating activities of $1,618,596. The Company has not yet generated any significant revenues, and has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $2,264,448 in cash proceeds the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable. The Company believes that its current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements through December 2016.     The Company's primary source of operating funds since inception has been from proceeds from private placements of convertible and other debt. The Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.     Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.              BIOCORRX, INC.    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT      The Company's property and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:            Depreciation expense charged to operations amounted to $1,433 and $2,801, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016; and $608 and $1,720, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.      NOTE 5   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY/ LICENSING RIGHTS      On June 30, 2015, the Company acquired the complete rights, title and interest in the Naltrexone Implant Formulation used specifically in the BioCorRx Recovery Program for an aggregate purchase price of $1,132,000 comprised of an obligation to pay $1,000,000 over 14 months starting October 1, 2015 and 3,000,000 of the Company's common stock at the market value of $0.044 per share as of the date of the agreement. The Company estimated a useful life of 10 years.      On March 31, 2016, the parties agreed to terminate the above described acquisition and to cancel any and all obligations assumed under the agreement. In connection with the cancellation, the Company recorded a loss on termination of licensing agreement of $132,804.     On January 26, 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire intellectual and contractual rights for all of North America with the option for Central and South America for Naltrexone Implants formulas created by the Seller for 24 months upon receipt of the intellectual property for a fee of $55,648. The Company, within the first 12 months has the right to purchase perpetual rights for above territories for a one-time fee, financed over 5 years. The rights are amortized over the 24 month contract life. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization was $18,905.     On July 28, 2016, the Company and Therakine, Ltd., an Irish private company limited by shares ("Therakine"), entered into a Development, Commercialization and License Agreement (the "Agreement"). Therakine has know-how and patents related to sustained release drug delivery technology (the "Technology"). Pursuant to the Agreement, Therakine granted the Company an exclusive license to utilize the Technology in developing injectable naltrexone products to treat patients suffering addiction to opioids, methamphetamines, cocaine, or alcohol. The Company is permitted to sell on a worldwide basis the products that utilize the Technology. The Agreement expires when the Company's last valid claim to Therakine's patents expires. Upon expiration of the Agreement, the licenses granted will become irrevocable and fully paid up.     The Company agreed to pay, in return for the license to the Technology, up to $2,750,000 in milestone payments and royalties ranging from 5% to 12% of net sales of products that use the Technology. The Company is also required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income it receives related to products that use the Technology. In the event Therakine enters into a license agreement with a third party for products unrelated to injectable naltrexone that use the Technology, Therakine will pay the Company a percentage of its income from these products.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       NOTE 13   STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS       Options      Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option model with a volatility figure derived from using the Company's historical stock prices. The Company accounts for the expected life of options based on the contractual life of options for non-employees. For employees, the Company accounts for the expected life of options in accordance with the "simplified" method, which is used for "plain-vanilla" options, as defined in the accounting standards codification.     The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining life consistent with the expected term of the options.      In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company's forfeiture rate, the Company analyzed its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options, and the number of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the Company's actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.     The Company estimated forfeitures related to option grants at a weighted average annual rate of 0% per year, as the Company does not yet have adequate historical data, for options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of employee and vesting non-employee options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:           On June 17, 2016, the Company awarded options to purchase an aggregate of 33,000,000 shares of common stock to key officers of the Company. These options vest monthly over 24 months and have a term of 10 years. The options have an exercise price of $0.0201 per share. The options had an aggregate grant date fair value of $628,283.     On June 17, 2016, the Company extended the term of previously granted options in aggregate of 13,500,000 initially expiring from November 2019 to July 2020 by five years to November 2024 to July 2025. The change in fair value of $53,858 was determined using the Black Scholes option model and charged to current to operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.             BIOCORRX, INC.    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)      The following assumptions were used in determining the change in fair value of extended options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:           The following table summarizes the stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:           The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding tables represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on options with an exercise price less than the Company's stock price of $0.039 as of September 30, 2016, which would have been received by the option holders had those option holders exercised their options as of that date.     The following table presents information related to stock options at September 30, 2016:           The stock-based compensation expense related to option grants was $78,535 and $104,713 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $142,193 and $143,448 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.     As of September 30, 2016, stock-based compensation related to options of $523,568 remains unamortized and is expected to be amortized over the weighted average remaining period of 1.67 years.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (unaudited)       NOTE 16   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS      ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:               Level 1      Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.                Level 2      Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.                   Level 3      Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.         Items recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the following items as of September 30, 2016:           Items recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the following items as of December 31, 2015:                   BIOCORRX, INC.

Business Overview      We are an addiction rehabilitation service company and developer of the BioCorRx Recovery Program headquartered in Anaheim, California. We were established in January 2010 and currently operating in Anaheim, California. The Company's current treatment program is called the BioCorRx Recovery Program. On January 7, 2014 we changed our name to BioCorRx Inc. to take advantage of unique branding of our BioCorRx Recovery Program and to look to acquire other addiction programs and healthcare related products and services. We operate within the  Specialty Hospitals, Expert Psychiatric  industry, specifically within the industry subsets of  Addiction Rehabilitation Hospital .      The BioCorRx Recovery Program is an addiction treatment protocol comprised of multiple parts: (1) an implant, administered by a licensed physician, of a proprietary compounded formulation of the medication, Naltrexone (implanted under the skin) (the "Implant") which can reduce alcohol and opioid cravings and certain effects over a period of time which typically is several months and longer than other means of administration of Naltrexone such as oral and injectable forms; and (2) uniquely and specifically structured, intensive one on one substance abuse disorder life coaching/counseling programs developed by BioCorRx Inc. (the "Counseling Program").      BioCorRx Inc. has been granted an exclusive license to the proprietary implant by its developer. The license allows BioCorRx to license to physicians and medical groups experienced in treating alcoholism and opioid addiction dependency the right to order the proprietary implant from the compounding pharmacies that have been licensed and trained to make the implant by its developer. It also allows BioCorRx to sub-license the implant access to territories in the U.S. and abroad.      BioCorRx is not a licensed health care provider and does not provide health care services to patients. BioCorRx does not operate substance abuse clinics. BioCorRx makes the BioCorRx Recovery Program available to health care providers to utilize when the health care provider determines it is medically appropriate and indicated for his or her patients. Any physician or licensed alcohol addiction treatment provider is solely responsible for treatment options prescribed or recommended to his or her patients. At all times, such providers retain complete and exclusive authority, responsibility, supervision and control over their medical practice, their patients, the treatment that their patients receive and any decision to prescribe the implant to any of the provider's patients.             BioCorRx does not condition its license to health care providers accessing the implant on their making available the Counseling Program to the providers' patients although BioCorRx certainly encourages that providers do so.      BioCorRx has issued several license and distribution agreements to several unrelated third parties involving the establishment of alcoholism and opioid addiction rehabilitation and treatment centers and creating certain addiction rehabilitation programs. The Company has substantially expanded its operations since 2013 through the licensing and distribution opportunities of its BioCorRx Recovery Program. There are over 15 licensed providers throughout California, Arizona, Utah, Georgia, Virginia, Oregon, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that offer the BioCorRx  Recovery Program. The company's current focus will continue on wider distribution across the United States, branding of the BioCorRx Recovery Program and acquisition of healthcare related products and services. The Company is committed to continuing to provide excellent rehabilitation products and services to healthcare providers nationwide as it expands the distribution of the BioCorRx Recovery Program to a network of independent licensed clinics.       Results of Operations      The following table summarizes changes in selected operating indicators of the Company, illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for the respective periods presented (components may not add or subtract to totals due to rounding):        Three Months ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months ended September 30, 2015       Three months ended September 30,              Revenues       Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $167,598 compared with $118,192 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of 42%.      The increase in revenue is directly related to the increased number of patients treated at licensed clinics and BioCorRx Recovery Program distribution.        Total Operating Expenses       Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $684,966 and $624,518, respectively, reflecting an increase of $60,448. The primary reasons for the increase in 2016 were due that we incurred increases in service provider costs as compared to 2015 and increase due to non-cash amortization of licensing agreement.      In addition, comparing the three months ended September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2015, consulting and investor relations fees increased from $167,512 to $312,014, accounting and legal fees decreased from $82,985 to $57,149, advertising increased from $1,825 to $60,034, and rent increased from $4,875 to $13,040. In addition, we incurred $85,311 as stock based compensation in 2016 compared to $251,037 in 2015.               Gain (loss) on change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability       As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding convertible debt and warrants with variable conversion provisions that had the possibility of exceeding our common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provision of this note. As such, we are required to determine the fair value of this derivative and mark to market each reporting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $1,877,231 loss on change in fair value of our derivative liabilities compared to $26,403 loss in the same period, last year.        Interest Expense       Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $214,192 and $164,742, respectively, the increase is due to debt discount amortization, a non-cash interest charge.        Net Loss       For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company experienced a net loss of $2,608,791 compared with a net loss of $697,471 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss is primarily due to the loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.       Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months ended September 30, 2015       Nine months ended September 30,              Revenues       Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $585,923 compared with $851,437 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 31%.      The decrease in revenue is directly related to the reduced number of patients treated at licensed clinics and BioCorRx Recovery Program distribution.       Total Operating Expenses       Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,850,239 and $5,273,171 reflecting a decrease of $3,422,932. The primary reasons for the decrease in 2016 were due to the fact that we incurred in 2015 i) the termination of our Naltrexone implant licensing agreement and replacing the rights with an acquisition agreement and ii) a loss on settlement of sub-licensing agreements, for charges of $3,639,694 and $118,027, respectively.      In addition, comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2015, consulting and investor relations fees increased from $402,517 to $655,290, accounting and legal fees increased from $110,212 to $243,953, advertising increased from $54,202 to $198,778, and rent increased from $11,952 to $22,362. In addition, we incurred $287,617 as stock based compensation in 2016 compared to $396,971 in 2015.               Gain (loss) on change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability       As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding convertible debt and warrants with variable conversion provisions that had the possibility of exceeding our common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provision of this note. As such, we are required to determine the fair value of this derivative and mark to market each reporting period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a $2,344,272 loss on change in fair value of our derivative liabilities compared to $77,765 gain in the same period, last year.        Interest Expense       Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $602,551 and $327,396, respectively, the increase is due to debt discount amortization, a non-cash interest charge.        Net Loss       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company experienced loss of $4,211,139 compared with a net loss of $4,671,365 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss is primarily due to the decrease in total operating expenses in 2016, net with increase in loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of approximately $80,625. The following table provides a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.      Nine months ended September 30,            On June 10, 2016, the Company issued to BICX Holding Company, LLC a $2,500,000 senior secured convertible promissory note due June 10, 2019 and bearing interest at 8% per annum due annually beginning June 10, 2018.      Under the terms of the note, the note holder may, at any time, convert the unpaid principal of the note, or any portion thereof, into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion price equal to 25% of the Company's total authorized common stock, determined at $0.019 per share at the date of issuance. In addition, the note contains certain anti-dilution provisions, as defined.      The Company is required to maintain a cash balance of 10% of the outstanding principal amount at all times, unrestricted and lien free.             The note holder has the right, until December 10, 2016, to purchase another convertible note from the Company in a principal amount of up to $2,500,000 for a total aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000. Based on the percentage of the maximum purchase price the note holder invests, they will receive another convertible note for a pro rata percentage the Company's total authorized common stock (up to another 26% of the Company's total authorized common stock, for a total of 51%, if the note holder invests the maximum purchase price). If the note holder does not exercise the right to pay the maximum purchase price, the note holder will pay the Company a break-up fee equal to 5% of the remaining balance of the maximum purchase price.      The note is secured by all of assets of the Company and is ranked senior to all of the Company's debt currently outstanding or hereafter, unless prohibited by law.     Currently we have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2016. We historically sought and continue to seek financing from private sources to move our business plan forward. In order to satisfy the financial commitments, we had relied upon private party financing that has inherent risks in terms of availability and adequacy of funding.      For the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will need to supplement our revenues with additional capital investment or debt to ensure that we will have adequate cash to provide the minimum operating cash requirements to continue as a going concern. . There can be no guarantee or assurance that we can raise adequate capital from outside sources. If we are unable to raise funds when required or on acceptable terms, we have to significantly scale back, or discontinue our operations.        Net Cash Flow From Operating Activities       Net Cash used in operating activities was $1,618,596 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $504,532 used in operating activities the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increased operating costs and expenses incurred in 2016 along with a net decrease in operating liabilities of $438,698.        Net Cash Flow From Investing Activities       Net cash used in investing activities increased by $220,875 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to payments for intellectual property, purchase of equipment and lease deposit in 2016.        Net Cash Flow From Financing Activities       Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $1,239,955, from $460,081 provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,700,036 cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily from $2,264,448 received from issuance of convertible note, net with repayments of notes payable of $564,412 as compared to $400,000 and $148,000 from advances and issuance of notes, respectively, net with $87,919 repayments of notes payable in 2015.       Going Concern      The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has a working capital deficit of $1,584,783 and $3,443,284, and an accumulated deficit of $17,442,022 and $13,230,883. We will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement the Company's business plan or by using outside financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these situations in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its operations by additional borrowings and some shareholder advances.              Off Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to an investment in our securities.       Critical Accounting Policies       Use of Estimates and Assumptions      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation, derivative and warrant liabilities, the fair value of other equity and debt instruments and allowance for doubtful accounts.       Revenue Recognition      We generate revenue from services and product sales. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ("ASC 605-10") which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the services delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recorded. We defer any revenue for which the services have not been performed or is subject to refund until such time that the we and the customer jointly determine that the services has been performed or no refund will be required.      We license proprietary products and protocols to customers under licensing agreements that allow those customers to utilize the products and protocols in services they provide to their customers. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from license agreements depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each agreement. Such agreements are reviewed for multiple elements. Multiple elements can include amounts related to initial non-refundable license fees for the use of our products and protocols and additional royalties on covered services.      Revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met: (1) written agreements have been executed; (2) delivery of product or intellectual property rights has occurred; (3) fees are fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability of fees is reasonably assured.      Under these license agreements, we receive an initial non-refundable license fee and in some cases, additional running royalties. Generally, we defer recognition of non-refundable upfront fees if it has continuing performance obligations without which the right, product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the licensee that is separate and independent of its performance under the other elements of the arrangement. License fees collected from Licensees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as income earned over the expected economic life of the related contract.              Deferred Revenue      We, from time to time, collect initial license fees when license agreements are signed and become effective. License fees collected from Licensees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as income earned over the economic life of the related contract.       Derivative Financial Instruments      We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding convertible notes and warrants that contained embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives include certain conversion features and reset provisions.      Stock-Based Compensation      Share-based compensation issued to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The Company measures the fair value of the share-based compensation issued to non-employees using the stock price observed in the arms-length private placement transaction nearest the measurement date (for stock transactions) or the fair value of the award (for non-stock transactions), which were considered to be more reliably determinable measures of fair value than the value of the services being rendered. The measurement date is the earlier of (1) the date at which commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not required under Regulation S-K for "smaller reporting companies."        ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                 (a)     Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.         Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.             Based on management's evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material weaknesses, which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are:                (b)     We did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions. As a result we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to provide for adequate reviewing of the financial statements. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.          Management believes that hiring additional knowledgeable personnel with technical accounting expertise will remedy the following material weaknesses: A lack of sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions to achieve adequate segregation of duties.      Management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge with the non-routine or technical issues we have encountered in the past will result in both proper recording of these transactions and a much more knowledgeable finance department as a whole. Due to the fact that our accounting staff consists of a Chief Financial Officer, additional personnel will also ensure the proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support us if personnel turnover issues within the department occur. We believe this will eliminate or greatly decrease any control and procedure issues we may encounter in the future.      We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.                (c)     Changes in internal control over financial reporting.         There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.               PART II. OTHER INFORMATION          ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       From time to time, we may be engaged in various lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Except as described below, we are currently not aware of any legal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which, in our judgment based on information currently available, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings or claims not previously disclosed on Form 8-K.       ITEM 1A.
